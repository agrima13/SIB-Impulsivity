2.0,6.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going with you lately?
6.0,55.0,Subject,"They're going okay. A few days ago I heard back from Ladders for Leaders, which is a program I'm in. So they referred me to an internship and they got back to me saying that I got the interview, but I haven't gotten any correspondence from the actual internship. So I was on the phone with Ladders all this morning, and I was just like, ""Oh, my God."" I didn't talk with them, but they have an interview for 11:30. I don't know what's going on, so she said to look out for emails. But, yeah, so that's been hectic for just figuring that out. But other than that I've been hanging out a bit more. I hung out with my friends yesterday. I'm going to hang out with my boyfriend today, so it's just going okay."
55.0,58.0,Interviewer,Cool. So your boyfriend's in town?
58.0,72.75,Subject,"Yeah. So he's working right now [inaudible], so we'll meet up after his work and after this. Also, they said, ""When are you free?"" ""After three."" So I might have an interview after three. I'm not even sure what's going on."
72.75,73.0,Interviewer,Today?
73.0,77.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm not sure what's going to go on today. But, yeah."
77.0,85.0,Interviewer,Cool. Very cool. What kinds of things do you think you'll do this afternoon?
85.0,121.0,Subject,"Not sure, probably I could see a movie or probably just go to the park, somewhere with A/C. It's just so hot. It's so hot. At times it's nice, and cool, and there's air, but at times it's just excrutiatingly hot. And I walked up, I don't know if it's two flights, but on Lexington Avenue, like when you're going up the train, there's just like a really tall amount, a massive amount of stairs. So I was just running and trying to figure this out. And then I wasted a metro card, so my day's already just not gone well because metro card. I just wasted $2.75 and yeah."
121.0,122.0,Interviewer,So you wasted it?
122.0,141.0,Subject,"Well, you get a transfer if you transfer from a train to another train within like half an hour, but I didn't realize that I had to go in, and I exited the station and came back to the same station. So I don't know, they charged me. I thought it'd count as a transfer. It didn't. So just a little thing here and there."
141.0,142.0,Interviewer,It's a bummer.
142.0,144.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't really know what to talk about, sorry."
144.0,145.0,Interviewer,No. No.
145.0,147.0,Subject,My life's pretty boring right now.
147.0,150.0,Interviewer,So are you excited for this interview?
150.0,184.0,Subject,"Kind of. Yes and no. It's like everything could go wrong because it's already starting out kind of messed up with like the scheduling, and I haven't gotten any correspondence from them. I'm excited because this is a position that I really want, but that's also kind of why I'm dreading it because if I don't get it it's like here I am again. But then I'm also trying to convince myself I can't be in any worse place than I am right now by putting my best into this internship. Interview, not internship, not yet."
184.0,187.0,Interviewer,"And so you're excited about the internship itself, then."
187.0,193.75,Subject,Yes. Yes. But I'm not excited about the process because I've been through the process too many times.
193.75,194.0,Interviewer,"Oh, really?"
194.0,210.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, because in my past interviews I went to the final round for both of them, and then at the end it was just like, ""Well, we've gone with someone else."" So that's why I'm here."
210.0,214.0,Interviewer,Tell us more about the internship.
214.0,267.0,Subject,"It's an experiential marketing internship. So it's in a staffing company. They work with lots of great brands, and they work with both start-ups and big businesses. They basically help provide staffing agency kind of stuff, and as well as experiential marketing, so helping them with the-- oh, this is good preparation. [laughter] But this is actually helping them with events, like promotional events, and those kinds of things. So this is the more hands-on side of the marketing in my interpretation. So this is like coming up with strategy, but also doing a lot of administrative tasks. It's not as strategy-wise, but I feel like this internship would be a good stepping stone to a marketing internship that's more strategy-wise and etc."
267.0,270.0,Interviewer,More strategy?
270.0,282.0,Subject,"More like upper-level management, not like [inaudible]. But I don't mind this because I have experience working in administrative and doing those kinds of tasks. But, yeah."
282.0,283.0,Interviewer,So you already have experience.
283.0,368.0,Subject,"I have a year at the budget office where I basically just did administrative and clerical work for a year. It's also making it harder for me to apply to other kind of jobs because right now all I have is like sales experience, like sales rep for [inaudible]. I don't know if you guys heard of it. But it's like [inaudible]. Anyways, it was a sad time. Anyway it was a bad time. Literally you're selling $300 knives to your friends and family and you know they don't want that knife. And you're known as the person that's like the knife person. I'm just like, ""I don't want that."" I didn't want to, so I quit within a month. So all the experience I have under my belt is sales experience and clerical experience. So it's hard to get anything that's like-- let's say I want to work at The Home Depot, or want to work at customer service, or something like that, or even a restaurant. Even for like part time, you don't have any experience. I'm like, ""I thought you didn't need experience."" I don't know. I guess they want some sort of [inaudible]. I'm kind of not sure where to go. But I have been getting more active online trying to find stuff, get involved in many things. I'm staying at the same place, but not as hopeless, like a little less hopeless. I mean, about the status of having a job."
368.0,378.0,Interviewer,It sounds like things are exciting now. How does that maybe differ from what was happening before?
378.0,425.0,Subject,"It's not too big a difference, but it's just more activity's happening. So like the last week, I think, it's just like every other week, nothing's really happening. You're just like, ""Ugh."" But the next week you're still feeling that way, but things are happening, so you don't have time to feel that way. You have to just act. You have to succeed and do stuff. That's what I'm doing this week. I've been a bit busier in that sense, both at home, both trying to look for stuff, socially a little bit more, just the same people, but still more hanging out, so spending more money than I shouldn't be because I don't earn money."
425.0,428.0,Interviewer,Spending time at home also [inaudible] with you?
428.0,438.0,Subject,"Spending a little less. Whenever I'm outside more, I don't spend as much, obviously, at home with my family, basically. I mean, it's okay. I'd prefer that over being at home all day."
438.0,441.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you would?"
441.0,452.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Because it gets tiring. I, personally, can't stay inside all day. It takes a toll on me mentally, so I need to go out and stuff and be active."
452.0,455.0,Interviewer,What do you mean my toll?
455.0,478.75,Subject,"I guess I get kind of down, and I also just like being out. I'm an outdoorsy person. I also like being at home alone to recharge and stuff, but if I can, I get my energy from being with others doing things and just being active, I guess. Being purposeful, putting myself to a purpose, that's how I get my energy."
478.75,479.0,Interviewer,Purposeful?
479.0,482.0,Subject,Yeah.
482.0,486.0,Interviewer,What kinds of things [inaudible] purposeful?
486.0,513.0,Subject,"I guess working for someone, or helping someone, or doing something where I know I'm making a difference, or getting paid, that too. Or just making an effort to make myself better, better myself personal and career-wise, academically. So just doing anything to move forward, be a little bit better than I was yesterday."
513.0,516.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So academically, you're in school, right?"
516.0,519.0,Subject,No. No. School's over.
519.0,520.0,Interviewer,"Right, so the summer."
520.0,522.0,Subject,"But, yeah, yeah. I'm in school."
522.0,526.0,Interviewer,Has it been very different from life at school?
526.0,557.0,Subject,"Yeah, total 180 because, again, I keep myself busy a lot during the school year. It's been similar in the sense that just because school ended, I haven't stopped seeing my friends, other than the friends that went abroad or went somewhere else. I've been hanging out or talking. It's been pretty regular. It just goes on to show that if you really want to see each other or talk to each other, it's not having something get there everyday won't stop you, so it was nice. Yeah."
557.0,560.0,Interviewer,So some of your friends are abroad?
560.0,567.0,Subject,"Yes. One of them's working, and a few of them are international as well, yeah. Classmates, yeah."
567.0,575.0,Interviewer,"Cool. With this internship, where do you see things going in the future?"
575.0,635.75,Subject,"Well, if I get it, I see myself working here for two months-- for the end of the summer 'til I leave. But I would hope, hopefully, they have an office somewhere in London, or if not, would allow me to work remotely. But I don't see that happening, so I'm also looking for remote jobs as well. But with this internship I definitely have some marketing experience on my resume, and I could just really get a feel for if I want to pursue this as a career, if this is where I want to go. Mostly I just want to have fun. I know it's weird, but I find that marketing-- they just seem more fun to me, especially an events internship because I love planning. That's like one of my favorite things, but they're not going to know any of this. So it's probably going to mess up the interview, and they're probably going to go with someone else even if I don't mess up the interview. They're not going to know any of that."
635.75,636.0,Interviewer,Why?
636.0,657.0,Subject,"Usually I feel like when the interviews go well, like the last two, they went so well. I thought I connected with people, and it just felt so genuine. But they're like, ""Oh, we could see you're genuinely interested,"" but even after that they went with someone else. So it's just like I don't know what's going to happen, especially now that mis-scheduling and stuff."
657.0,659.0,Interviewer,You never know.
659.0,668.0,Subject,"You never know, yeah. I shouldn't be too pessimistic today because they want someone upbeat. [laughter]"
668.0,671.0,Interviewer,You mentioned a London office?
671.0,721.0,Subject,"Well, I'm not sure if they have an office. I have to look it up, but some companies that are international, they do have offices. I know my friend who works in Nielson. Well, Nielson's a global company, but they have offices in major European cities, few in Asia, major Asian cities. Because of that, sometimes my friend, she's able to work at different cities. Like a team in that city will probably welcome someone in from that city and they'll be like, ""Well, can you find accommodations?"" And it's a bit easier to travel when you have that offer. If you make a good impression, if you want to continue at the company and they want you there, and you're just like, ""This is what I really want to do. Would it be possible to do this?"" And sometimes if you have a really good manager, that might happen. But I'm not sure about this, so I'm thinking way too ahead."
721.0,726.0,Interviewer,"No, it's great. Are you interested in travel?"
726.0,761.0,Subject,"I love travel. I want to travel a lot. I'm so jealous right now, but my friend who I said about Nielson, she's literally living out my dream life. She's staying in Japan. She's been in Japan for like a month working in Japan remotely. I have family in Japan, so I wouldn't be alone. So that would be the perfect chance for me. I'd get to stay with my family. I'd get to work. I'd get to explore different parts of Japan, travel. These are like traveling and working goals. That's what I want. Yeah, so I really want to travel a lot, especially for my job."
761.0,762.0,Interviewer,Is Japan a particular interest?
762.0,840.0,Subject,"It's one of many interests, yes. I'm sorry. I'm not really good at any of this conversation. It's one of many interests. I have a cousin there, so that helps. But, also, I'm just really into anime. Well, I'm going to Europe soon, and so that's going to help me explore that part of the world. But I'm really interested in Asian countries, so southeast Asia, east Asia, south Asia. Well, I'm from south Asia, so probably not as interested. But I'll probably go to visit too with my parents. South Asia, southeast Asia, and also the Middle East. Well, not the Middle East, but like safer parts of the Middle East. And then parts of southern Europe and like southeastern and southern Europe. I really want to go to Montenegro and Greece. Also, do you know when the new [inaudible] movie's coming out? Yeah. It's coming out in July, so I just can't wait. So definitely that was one of the things that sparked my interest. Yeah, sparked my interest in Greece. But [inaudible], like pictures of [inaudible] is just so gorgeous."
840.0,843.0,Interviewer,"Stunning, I know. I just want to go."
843.0,844.0,Subject,Hopefully.
844.0,849.0,Interviewer,What's drawing you to all those various regions [inaudible]?
849.0,917.0,Subject,"I remember when I first came to America, then when we were first going back to [inaudible] for the first time after we came to America, which was, I think, four years after we came to America. So that was in 2010. I just remember going to the airport and it just felt like everything was off and I was like, ""Wow. I could go anywhere."" And it just felt like my heart was really just open, and I was going. I was seeing all the connections and [inaudible]. I don't know. It's just all of that, like how connected everything was, how small our world is, really, even though it's so large. It was just like a moment when you're young and you get inspiration, but you don't know what to do with it. You just know you have inspiration. But I never was able to forget that. I know whenever I go into airports right now and I'm not just going for like a few days or something. I'm just going for a while and it's like I'm starting a new adventure. I don't know. It just feels so freeing."
917.0,918.0,Interviewer,Freeing?
918.0,921.0,Subject,Yeah. It feels so freeing.
921.0,928.0,Interviewer,"So that sense of adventure, what do you think draws you to that?"
928.0,969.0,Subject,"Not sure, I guess every person has their own thing. I'm not sure. I think just going and seeing difference in cultures, and just being able to be apart of this bigger connection, and just go and go places. Also, I saw different peoples. When I was on flights, flight attendants, I'd be like, ""Oh, they're so pretty. They're so put together."" And then people and their luggages. It's little things here and there that leave an impression on me. I can't really explain what drew me to it. It's just I was drawn to it."
969.0,972.0,Interviewer,"So you're going to Europe this summer, I think?"
972.0,977.75,Subject,"No. I'm leaving on August 28, I think. I'm going to go for the fall semester."
977.75,978.0,Interviewer,"Oh, very cool."
978.0,1001.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I'll be there from August 29th to December 31st even though the program ends a little bit earlier, I'm staying a week or two extra because I'm traveling with my friends. They're coming from New York to travel, but my parents don't know that. I'm coming home the end of December, probably the 30th. Sorry."
1001.0,1005.0,Interviewer,No. So what are you planning on doing there?
1005.0,1106.0,Subject,"That's a big thing. I had so many plans, but now it's like I have to fund those plans. I also have to feed myself while I'm there. But I also have like two days of classes. It's not even purposeful. So I have five classes. So I'm taking a full semester course because [inaudible] has a campus in London so all my credits will transfer, all my grades will transfer. All my five classes just fell within two days. I just have classes 9 o'clock to 6 o'clock one day, nine o'clock to nine o'clock another day. But it's just like an hour or two break in between each. But it's okay. I have like two days classes with like five days straight. I'm excited but I'm also kind of dreading it because I don't think I have enough money and I'm a spend-aholic. So especially when you go traveling, you're splurging a bit more. I have to kind of train my brain to just not do that. Also, I was also working on applying to work on doing the real estate license class while I was in London, or getting a bunch of licenses and stuff. Well, because I have a lot of free time and not a lot of money. So that's probably the best idea to apply myself during that time. I'm going to be there for four months. That's a long time. It's not like I'm going to be going out all the time. My friend who's in Japan, I'm rooming with her in London because she's going to London as well. So we're the only two that we know of from each other that are going there. We're [inaudible]."
1106.0,1109.0,Interviewer,"That'll be fun, being with your friend."
1109.0,1151.0,Subject,"Yeah. We're similar, but she's also a little bit different because the way she approaches things is a bit different. But I feel like when we hang out, we can make compromise of stuff that can happen. I feel like when we talk about things, things are just so different, like she wants this, and I want this. But then I know that in person we're fine. But it's just like with going out and stuff, she's like, ""No, once or twice a week."" But I'm just like, ""I don't like being told how many times I can go out. That should happen naturally."" She thinks I'm going to go wild and I'm like, ""No, I just don't like being told once or twice."" That was one thing we were working through."
1151.0,1159.0,Interviewer,Makes sense. What kind of things do you think you'll do when you'll go out?
1159.0,1208.0,Subject,"Probably clubs. But if not, I'm not really into clubs that much. She is, but I'm really not because I can't dance. I just sit there. I don't really know what to do with my body and my hands. I'm like, ""I don't really like clubs that much,"" but she's into clubs because she can dance and she's pretty. Anyways, but I'm more into the pub scene. You just sit, chill with friends and just drink. And just maybe watch TV or sing. I don't know. So we'll probably do a little bit of both. And we have two more [inaudible] flatmates, so that'll be interesting because they're from Boston. [inaudible] one program. They're from St. Louis. You know, honestly, I'm not sure. So they're from there. So I hope [inaudible] getting to know them."
1208.0,1217.0,Interviewer,"Well, so what kinds of licenses do you think you'd be interested in?"
1217.0,1278.0,Subject,"So the real estate license, New York state real estate license, of course, because I want to, hopefully, do it on the side maybe after a few years. Because you can earn some money. Eventually my goal for that side business is to own houses globally and then just buy and sell and just have a place to go everywhere. And now with Airbnb's, you can earn extra money on top of that. So there's that. I want to do that on the side if I can. And other licenses, I'll have to look it up to see what's useful because there's sometimes I want to learn programming codes and languages and stuff because that might be helpful in searching for jobs. So I'll definitely stay more into that side, just licenses such as for what I want to pursue in the future, maybe a fun license or two like CPR. I don't know, whatever's available. We'll see. I don't know. I don't know."
1278.0,1281.0,Interviewer,And they offer all those things?
1281.0,1297.0,Subject,"Well, you can always find free classes around, or if not, you can pay a little bit. And definitely they should have it in London. They probably have it in Europe. They should probably have it in London. I was thinking of doing that aside from school. I have too much free time. It's five days. I don't know what to do with myself."
1297.0,1300.0,Interviewer,I'm sure there'll be a lot of prep for classes.
1300.0,1314.0,Subject,"Yeah. In the beginning, definitely. I mean, I want to get on a schedule too, because, again, everything falls on those two days. I'm assuming every test and everything is going to fall on those two days, so that studying schedule is going to be intense."
1314.0,1319.0,Interviewer,Do you know what classes you're taking already?
1319.0,1345.0,Subject,"Yes. I'm taking marketing research, legal frameworks of business. Am I taking ethics? I'm not sure. I think I might be taking ethics. I'm also taking intro to theater. And I'm also taking text and contexts, yeah. Five classes, I think. Is that five? I don't know. I couldn't tell."
1345.0,1349.0,Interviewer,What do you think drew you to those classes in particular?
1349.0,1367.75,Subject,"Core requirement. So two of them are liberal arts core and three of them are business course. That's my core requirements, getting those out of the way while I'm doing something in a place I really like. Fordham has a lot of core."
1367.75,1368.0,Interviewer,It does?
1368.0,1385.0,Subject,"Yeah, liberal arts core as well as business core. Well, I'm business school so they have business core as well. Then, on top of that, you can put on a major, which is your major requirements and then electives are at the very end whenever you have time."
1385.0,1388.0,Interviewer,"So you're taking not only the business core, but also liberal arts core?"
1388.0,1419.0,Subject,"Yeah, a liberal arts core, yes. Unlike some other people, we have to take a few less classes than people in the [inaudible] College, in Fordham College, like few extra less because Gibelli has their core on top. So we just kind of mix and match, so Gibelli's core minus a few of the Fordham liberal arts core. Yeah. That's what I'm taking."
1419.0,1421.0,Interviewer,Do you like any of the courses you're taking?
1421.0,1580.0,Subject,"Yeah. I've definitely found that my theology class. I'm surprised that I'd like my theology course, but my professor for theology was awesome. Great teacher, and actually, he's a historian. He wrote a book called Dorothy Day or something. He wrote a book about Dorothy Day. He also wrote a book about on the Irish waterfront about Irish immigrant workers working on the west side. And it was just really interesting, and a lot of crime that happened. He also studied American Rock history. He was interesting. I love him. He's cool. He said I was one of his favorite students. I don't know, whatever. But I also like my Middle Eastern history class, even though that was at 8:30, so I fell asleep a lot, but I liked it and I did well. Apparently he does not easily give out A's, but I got an A minus, so I'm happy with that. I also really liked my anthropology class. So my professor for that class actually worked for the U.N. Well, her family's from Somalia. I don't know if you've ever heard of-- we discussed a lot of political issues, and a lot of human rights issues in that class because that's how she chose to go about that class. And I was reading a thing about female circumcision and how that effects childbirth and all of that stuff. This was something I have in my memory from that class because everyone was just like, ""Oh, my God. We can't [inaudible]."" She said, ""You guys can't say that you can't read this, people actually have to live with this. I almost died giving birth to my daughter."" And I'm just like, ""[inaudible],"" because it's like wow, I didn't realize that she had experiences also. Because it's like there are somethings about my culture, about Indian culture, about [inaudible]. They were talking about belief in ghosts and even people [inaudible] or to deal with pressures in life and go into the belief of supernatural. I don't know. I was looking at my culture from an outside lense and after seeing [inaudible] genital mutilation, I'm like, ""Wow. This is my professor. This is how she is after this experience that I'm looking at as an outsider."" So that perspective-ness was really nice for that class. That was actually one of my major classes. So that was really interesting and I'm so glad I [inaudible] for my other classes."
1580.0,1582.0,Interviewer,Your other classes?
1582.0,1595.0,Subject,"In my major, yeah. Because right now I've been doing a lot of core stuff. So this year I'm just getting into my major and stuff and my concentration. It's been exciting."
1595.0,1598.0,Interviewer,What's exciting?
1598.0,1640.75,Subject,"Mostly the marketing classes. That's just fun. That's what it is. I mean, it's not as stressful as a lot of the finance classes [inaudible]. It's just fun and you're learning about people. But you're also learning about technology in a way where you can learn so much. You can understand so much. Idk. I'm fully now convinced that this is-- I'm not really sure because I don't have marketing experience, that this is what I'm going to go into, but definitely is, just from the classes I've taken, like anthropology and market research. I really like research classes. I'm looking forward to the research classes as well as the analytics classes. So it's definitely something. It's fun coming up."
1640.75,1641.0,Interviewer,The analytics classes?
1641.0,1657.0,Subject,Yeah. There's marketing analytics class I'm taking in the spring semester. It's using more technology and different stuff to analyze market data.
1657.0,1660.0,Interviewer,So you think technology's [inaudible].
1660.0,1678.0,Subject,"Yes, but not as much as like learning about different people and different cultures. I'm like anthropology, Middle Eastern history. I'm a history geek, so I love learning about people in that sense, culturally, and in terms of behavioral stuff, so that's really fascinating for me. But technology is something I've been getting into recently because it's just like, ""Wow. Look at the power."""
1678.0,1679.0,Interviewer,Power?
1679.0,1718.0,Subject,"Power in technology you have. Because of technology, we can do so much today. You go to a place, you get a notification on your phone saying, ""Rate this place. How is this place?"" It's just like that, little things in everyday, it affects our life in every single way. And some of us can even be addicted to our phone. So it's a powerful aspect in our lives I feel like. So I feel like we have to, in some ways or another, to a certain extent, we have to be involved in technology I feel like because it just affects us so much."
1718.0,1740.0,Interviewer,Yeah. For sure. It sounds like you have a lot of very exciting classes ahead. What else do you think you're excited for down the line in your schooling?
1740.0,1788.0,Subject,"Classes are fun. I'm excited for... That's hard. Other than classes, I'm excited to graduate. I know that that's not a legit answer, but I'm excited to go to all the senior events. But I'm not excited to go unless I have a job lined up. I'm not excited for that, but if I have a job lined, I'm excited for that, just enjoying and chilling and just taking in everything. And then having that job. That would be the ideal situation. Or being able to travel and then get a job, or just start that job. That would be ideal, but you never know. Things don't really seem to go as you plan. So it's whatever."
1788.0,1797.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So do you think having a job is more exciting for you than school?
1797.0,1850.0,Subject,"No, but definitely it's more important than school. I think there's something about school life and college that's really just free. And we're not in the real world and it feels awesome, but you're kind of touching it. It's definitely more important I feel like. It's important to keep your grades up, yes. I understand and stuff, but I feel like without a proper experience it's like-- even if you have good grades, like what can you do with that? If you haven't done something before because I've learned first hand that it's just like if you don't have experience, no one wants to hire you. Going through all this is just making me realize having a job is really important. But while I'm in school, especially during test seasons, I focus completely on that. And there's a time for this and a time for that."
1850.0,1854.0,Interviewer,What do you think is so important about having a job to you?
1854.0,1911.0,Subject,"Financial security, kind of being able to do what you want. Not have to worry about money every single time you do something. I mean, I used to think that a job would kind of define your personality, but I don't think it does. I think you can just live your life the way you want without having your ideal job, but definitely it's something you can bear to do everyday, not bear to do, that sounds bad. But something you can live with. There are goods and bads of any job, with something you can live with, if you can't really live with it, then it's probably time to go. But if you can deal with this and find good, and if the goods outweigh the bad, that's probably okay. Just having security, that's what job means to me. I like having security, especially like right now, it's probably not the best time, but everyday stuff I still like having a job, even if it isn't like for saving for something. It's just because it gives me security and freedom to go about things."
