0.0,6.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,52.0,Subject,"Lately, things have been better. Still routine stress and anxiety and periodic depression, but been a lot more proactive and accepting and managing stress better than the previous months. And since starting to see Shayna, actually, for this newer study [inaudible], I've been a little more at ease. I've been having a really good experience with her, so. And that educational therapy has been really good."
52.0,53.0,Interviewer,Really good?
53.0,55.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
55.0,64.0,Interviewer,So you said you've been more accepting. In what way?
64.0,103.0,Subject,"Just when things come or stressors come, just being less manic. And just kind of dealing with things as they come, and not expending a lot of worry energy where I can help it. And just being more calm about things, and just seeing what I can do about the situation. I'm kind of letting a lot of stuff go."
103.0,106.0,Interviewer,What kind of stuff?
106.0,162.0,Subject,"The things I can't control and the things that I know I'm worried a lot about or that drain me to think about or to wrestle with and people who may be triggering-- or anxiety that may be perpetuated or encouraged or flaming the fire by my own doing. So just being attentive to that and self-monitoring and, I guess, compartmentalizing things a little more organized or emotionally. Yeah."
162.0,163.0,Interviewer,Compartmentalize?
163.0,188.0,Subject,Just placing things in their priority and importance and relevance to my life and then the moment at hand and the task at hand and my health and my happiness and just situating everything accordingly.
188.0,195.0,Interviewer,So in that sense you're saying that the past few months have been better?
195.0,205.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Still ups and downs, but I've been handling it better so it's felt better. I feel more in control."
205.0,206.0,Interviewer,More in control?
206.0,208.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
208.0,213.0,Interviewer,And what do you mean by the ups and downs?
213.0,333.0,Subject,"The things that are stressful and may trigger past traumas or a period of depression. Just everyday things or the bigger things, bills and debt and negative relationships or parts of relationships that are negative and may reflect something in me that I wasn't ready to deal with or didn't know how to deal with. Yeah. And then trying new things and moving my work and career and personal education forward. So things being new, it's a little nerve-wracking. And challenging myself and meeting new people and having to regulate that relationship from the onset and not project negativity on it. Dealing with negative when it comes, and not wanting to burn bridges, but also wanting to stand up for myself and be protected. Because I'm in the art industry, there's so many pitfalls. And there's so many competing agendas. And when you're young, especially, when you're female, there's so many people just preying on certain situations. So just being very proactive and doing my research. And, yeah, getting advice if I need it or just an outlet. And learning how to not internalize other people's behavior."
333.0,339.0,Interviewer,So you said there's a lot of new things. What are some of those things?
339.0,494.0,Subject,"Well, I've been performing more. And so I have to have new material and a show to present. And that also requires me to be vocally in shape and healthy, and physically in shape and healthy. So it's meant a lot more exercise and movement. Creatively, I've been very productive. And been doing a lot more behind the scenes work with the studio that I work for. And, [okay?] I'm, basically, co-owner of the studio now. So weekly and monthly, there's rotating deadlines. So there's all types of new things being produced. And it's made me also take on other roles that I didn't plan on taking on. But I just came to realize like, ""Oh, this needs to be done. Oh well, I could do it. It's no problem."" And so talking with more people and coming up with more systems of organizing. And then the balance of when both these things, the personal and professional things, are escalating, how to keep that balanced. And, yeah, so there's that. I've reconnected with a few people from my network from when I was younger and doing other things and establishing or re-establishing relationships with them. My and my boyfriend at the time, we broke up and got back together, and broke and got back together. And so that's been a lot of reconfiguring and reconciling and deciding and distracting and just a lot of emotional wrestling with that. But also, just coming to a new place after all this wrestling, just feeling different. Yeah. So, yeah, lots of new things."
494.0,498.0,Interviewer,And what kind of performances are you doing now?
498.0,667.0,Subject,"I rap and sing and do some movement and poetry and sometimes, depending on the venue, we project images behind me. And I have a few things that I've created just for that. So it's like a multimedia kind of experience. June, I haven't done a show. I haven't done a show right now in a month, maybe, but-- and I was supposed to perform last weekend. But I ended up just working the event and hosting. So in a way it still kind of felt like performing because I was in front of everybody, and I had to speak publicly and kind of engage people. And so it still kind of felt like a show. And I had copyrighted one other song. I haven't released it yet. But I put it in for the copyright, and the copyright certificate came back to me around, maybe, April-- May or April, it was a while. But the filing happened back in February for a song that was like in December. So it was really cool to see my name and it says songwriter, lyrics, music arrangement, sound recording and has my name. And it's like the US government seal [laughter]. And it's pretty cool. That's the first time I ever got that, so I felt pretty good about that."
667.0,668.0,Interviewer,And that's amazing.
668.0,670.0,Subject,Thank you.
670.0,677.0,Interviewer,"And rapping or singing, are these things you had done in the past or are they--?"
677.0,706.0,Subject,"Yeah. I've been doing that since-- I've been rapping since I was in about the fifth grade. And then when I was about 12, that's about the sixth grade, yeah, I joined a youth group that did everything: singing, dancing, acting, writing poetry. And I was with that group for over 10 years."
706.0,707.0,Interviewer,Wow.
707.0,840.0,Subject,"Yeah, so I've been performing and stuff for a long time. It's just that when I left the group for three years, four, maybe, five years, I wasn't-- we used to do 50 shows a year and rehearse every week. And every rehearsal was like a seven-hour day. And it was very involved. And then, suddenly, I left and all of a sudden, I didn't have all that activity anymore., And at first, unexpectedly, I had like a withdrawal because I just-- my body, everything, I was so used to that throw of things, and suddenly it was just a lot less activity in my life. And also, just the release of energy and emotional connection of performing, I didn't have that anymore, with the audiences, but also with the group. And we were a family, and we had grown up together. And that was a big part of my stability and maturing and seeing the world and learning lessons and even shaping my view of the world that organization. So for a while, I was just very thrown off. And then I was like-- finally, it was like, ""Okay, it's time to start getting your solo career, basically."" Still sounds weird to me, but [laughter]. It was like, ""Wait, it's a good thing because now you can do whatever you want to do. You don't have to-- you're not with 29 other people on a stage anymore. It's just you, and you have all these things you want to do."" So I started that and, yeah. So it's hard work but I really love it. And I really feel that a lot of things are going to flourish through this work."
840.0,853.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And when you left your youth group, what were you thinking? What made you decide to leave the group?"
853.0,1061.0,Subject,"Oh, I had been there I think it was going on 13 years at the time, and I had become staff. I had gone through junior staff. I was then senior staff. And I was handling a lot of management of the program and actual programing, but also taking care of the kids. And I just got to a point where I felt like I wasn't growing anymore. And then also I wasn't very happy with the way the program was being run. As much as I dearly respect and love my elders in the program, especially, my mentors-- the two uncles who founded [it?], they were, basically, my mentors. And I was about to-- I was heading to finish college-- or I was three-quarters of the way there. And going to school-- going to college, specifically, while doing all of that was very hard. And I also felt like I wasn't really appreciated or-- yeah, I was questioning the value of how much I was shifting and sacrificing to make sure the program kept running, even though I was in school. And I wasn't really sure, so. And then just seeing what I didn't like about the way the program was being run, I was seeing how it was affecting the kids, and that really put my heart in a not so great place. So I just kind of didn't want to be a part of it anymore. And I was dating a man at the time who had asked me about like, ""If you had a program, what would you do,"" or, ""What kind of things do you want to do?"" And through those conversations, I formulated a non-profit organization that I wanted to start or to be able to do the things that I saw weren't being done or add on to it. And that kind of got legs. And so I just came to an intersection of all those points where I was like, ""Maybe it's just time to leave and finish school and start this new thing."" And I didn't even think about-- I mean, I always knew I was going to keep performing. But once the new thing started, then all of a sudden, it was full steam ahead on a whole other organization. And so I then knew that I was definitely leaving because there just was not going to be enough time in the day. But, yeah, I, basically, left because I wasn't growing anymore. I didn't like the reverberation of the work we were doing. And I felt that I needed more support and that my time was better spent doing some more effective things. I needed to give to myself. I had a given a lot, so."
1061.0,1063.0,Interviewer,And was that a hard transition?
1063.0,1339.0,Subject,"Yeah. It was very hard. Like I said, I had the withdrawal. That relationship that I was in, that sparked the non-profit-- that was really positive starting that. And that was like a two to three-year run of getting things off the ground, putting things together, which was really great working. That's almost invaluable the experience of starting an organization. The more I'm out here now, the more I see that was a huge thing, and all the documentation and getting a business plan together and launching and doing events and having workshops and collecting data and having a lawyer and all of that. It's like when I look [back?] it's very surreal. I can't even believe I did that. And it was with my father, and that was great because it helped our relationship. But that relationship that I was in that sparked that wasn't-- it wasn't always positive. And so that relationship kind of took over my life at the time. And I felt, after a while, that I was starting to lose myself or had already lost a great deal of myself. And that combined with already feeling a little off because I'm not Amelia from Impact anymore-- I mean, to some people that's how I always am. But like the point was that I was always attached to something. I was always representing something. I was always a part-- I was never my own person. And so that, and slide that into a relationship where my partner is kind of really dominating and a little manipulative and just like this presence over my life. And I wasn't-- we were social. But as far as staying connected to my network, it really hurt a lot of things. And even my relationship with my father to an extent. He wasn't too fond of him. So it was hard. But then it was-- because that time was hard, having a partner helped. So I was leaning on him or depending on him emotionally, but then seeing that it wasn't all healthy. So that was hard dealing with that. And then finishing school was very hard. I wanted to quit so many times. I just didn’t have a good experience in undergrad. And I just wanted to be finished as soon as possible. I just I never really had the student experience. I was always out doing shows or running Impact or working. A couple of times I had to not take classes just so I could work. And so I didn't really have a lot of-- well, I definitely didn't have friends friends, and I didn't really-- I did some extra-curricular things, but I wasn't in clubs or recognized by people who were in clubs. And it was very oil and water. So I felt very disconnected from the experience. And then my father was going-- he worked at the school. That's why I got to go there, not completely for free, but mostly for free. But it's crazy. Even with no tuition, it's still a lot of money with the books and the metro card, and we're not even talking about food, laundry. And then I lived in my own apartment. And that was stressful because I didn't always have the money to cover my rent. So I just always had my head in other places. And so, yeah, that time was pretty hard. And not having the program anymore and being forced to be my own person, it's almost like I slid past that because I was like, ""Oh, well, actually, now I represent this,"" so. But, yes, so leaving that program was very hard. It was almost like for 12, 13 years, I wasn't me, I was the program. Yeah, so."
1339.0,1343.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that seems really hard juggling all of those things at once."
1343.0,1350.0,Subject,Yeah. I really don't know how I did it.
1350.0,1377.0,Interviewer,"And so speaking of kind of moving on from one thing to the next, what sparked this new chapter in your life, the one where you're now going, performing and doing shows? What made you switch over to that?"
1377.0,1421.75,Subject,"Being more in tune now with me as myself, me as my own person, and for the first time-- even though, technically, now it's like I represent the Brooklyn studio in a way. And before that, I represented a studio in the Bronx and that was kind of-- but still with it just being small businesses, it's a lot easier to just be like, ""Oh, but I'm this person, and this is an offshoot of what I do,"" or whatnot. Instead of the total 24 hour-- I don't know if that makes any sense. But it's definitely--"
1421.75,1422.0,Interviewer,Yes.
1422.0,1653.0,Subject,"--a different feel. And also, because I had grown up in the program it's different. I went from a child-- I went from childhood to adulthood in that program. And then I went from-- I don't know how you say, but I was-- by the time I finished college, I was done or in the throes of the other organization. So I'm on the other side of so many milestones. And this new chapter is also past-- that toxic relationship is also over. And I've moved around a few times. And I've come to-- even though it's not-- it's still not completely secure or stable, I should say-- or to my liking, I should say, but I've come to a stable place of living, which is definitely not the case for the last few years. And not dealing with school. And even though we're broken up/not broken up, coming out of this new relationship. And I've just come to a new place as a person, as a woman, in my life and really charged myself with like, ""Okay, look when I said, 'Okay, now you can do what you want five years ago,' you didn't really do that [laughter]. You kind of did for other people or you took on a whole bunch of other things that made it really easy for you to hide behind other things. And they're really positive things. So people see it and it's like, 'Oh, it's great.' But still, I know inside you still have so many undone things about you and your personal visions and goals. So now is the time."" And so, yeah, that's what this kind of new era, if you will, has been about. And I, definitely, feel different. And I'm coming to a more honest place in myself, especially, about my past and not wanting to repeat a lot of the negative cycles that I went through in the past. So it's been a very healing time where I've constantly been reaching for healing and more understanding, and not wanting to be controlled or moved so much by other people, and not wanting other things to represent me anymore, wanting to represent myself and have, sincerely, my own voice. And that's been happening with little steps. And that just feels completely-- it's like I'm rapping the same way-- I mean, not the same way. But I'm doing the same things I was doing all those years. But now it's more in earnest because it's really my voice, and it's what I really want to do and yeah. So I've just been a lot more proactive about what I want out of life and also the happiness and the health that I want and that that's important."
1653.0,1667.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It seems it's important for you to represent yourself instead of being you representing a program or a studio.
1667.0,1805.0,Subject,"Or even my relationship with my father, my relationship with the man that I was with back then when the new organization was starting, these are very-- my uncles that are my mentors. These are very dominant male figures. And I'm super [inaudible] as far as like a piece of clay, I'm a great piece to mold and shape and work with and collaborate with. But at the same time, these dominant figures-- it's not that I was completely submissive, but it's like I was in the shadow of what they meant to my life. And, yeah, so, I mean, I understand it a lot better now because my parents' divorce was rough and me being an only child and the traumas here and there, it was important to me to feel connected to something positive and to get a sense of real love and real construction in life. So I understand it. But I also see, without being malicious, that people are easily opportunistic about good things. And I feel like I put myself in that position a lot of times and, unknowingly, let people put me in that position a lot of times. When I say proactive, that's what I kind of mean like being more vigilant-- that’s a good word. Being more vigilant about my worth and my energy and how I'm like, ""You can be good at a whole lot of things or good for a lot of things, but are those things good for you?"" Not so much all the time."
1922.0,1930.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Well, thank you for sharing all of that with me. I think it's a good place to end this."
