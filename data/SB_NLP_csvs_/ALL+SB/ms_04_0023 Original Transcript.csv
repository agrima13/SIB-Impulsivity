0.0,5.0,Interviewer,Let's just start with how things are going with you lately?
5.0,61.0,Subject,"A little bit overwhelming because this has been the last semester of occupational therapy school. And even though this semester was really easy, they gave me a lot of work all at once at the end. And so it was a lot of presentations and a lot of coordinating not even tests but just a lot of outside-of-school work. And we had to do something with our capstone community project and presenting in front of a bunch of diesel truck workers. It was really nerve-racking because they had all sorts of questions I wasn't expecting to give me about repetitive strain injuries. We managed to get through it, but it was just really-- it was very anxiety inducing. And I'm glad that's all done and finally have some time to just relax. I have a couple more tests, but it's not bad, all things considered."
61.0,62.0,Interviewer,So you completed a capstone?
62.0,78.75,Subject,"Yeah, as far as the requirements for our occupational therapy major. In the master's degree, I think we do research and we do a capstone. We do a couple of other things in the school. We come back from fieldwork, and then we do the capstone."
78.75,79.0,Interviewer,Fieldwork?
79.0,139.0,Subject,"Yeah. So we have two different levels of clinical affiliation. Level one is not always supervised by an occupational therapist, but it's like you go into the community. You provide some sort of service. You get trained. We had to do something for fall prevention for seniors. We went into adult daycare center and places like that, and we just ran a 12-week course on how to not fall and how to deal with fall-- how to deal with getting out from a fall. And then for level two, you're supervised by an occupational therapist, and you're basically just an unlicensed OT working in different settings. I was in mental health for the first one. I was working in a homeless shelter in Manhattan and then also in the Bronx; there was two sites. And then with the second affiliation, I was just at Triboro Center in the Bronx, which is skilled nursing, and that was awesome."
139.0,140.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]?
140.0,165.0,Subject,"Yeah. So the first experience wasn't that good. Really, it's never mind the setting. I don't want to work with kids, but if you had put me in pediatrics place, I would have been totally fine if the therapist who was supervising me was compassionate and wasn't a total hard-ass [laughter]. But this person, the first one, kept threatening to fail me for a bunch of reasons that were, in hindsight, kind of racist, but--"
165.0,166.0,Interviewer,Wow.
166.0,191.0,Subject,"Yeah. It was the middle of winter, and I was wearing a beanie indoors because the heat wasn't working in the room that we were in. And she was saying that that wasn't professional. And she went after me about my beard because it was a little longer than this. And she made it such a big deal that she called my fieldwork coordinator at my college, that like, ""He's not being professional."" Then she went after me about my Afro, that I was conveying a sense of vulnerability. And I was like, ""You know-- "" Yeah. And I'm like--"
191.0,192.0,Interviewer,Vulnerability?
192.0,270.0,Subject,"It was really wild. And it was like that for 12 straight weeks, just constantly threatening to fail me. She gave me just a passing grade. But the second site, because I went there and the guy was like, ""As long as you don't murder anybody, you're going to pass."" And I was like, ""I don't plan to murder anybody, so we're fine."" And being told right out the gates that I'm guaranteed passing, I decided to just take out all of my frustration with the first site and give them the best possible work I could do at the skilled nursing facility. I through everything at it. I did research constantly. I only did do one project, but every week, I brought in a new thing I wanted to try or I made a new project. I tried new things on my patients. I was bothering all of the clinicians. I was like, ""Can you show me how to do this? Can you show me how to do that?"" Just to spite the people at the first site, I was like, "" You know what? You're not getting my best. These guys are."" And at the end, they threw in a pizza party, and they all chipped in to buy me an Optimus Prime, a Transformer. I mentioned once in the beginning. They were like, ""Oh, what do you like to do?"" I was like, ""I have a Transformers collection. It's been a while."" And then my fieldwork instructor remembered that. 12 weeks later, he went and he bought me this toy, and I was like, ""Oh my God."""
270.0,271.0,Interviewer,That's so sweet.
271.0,272.0,Subject,It was the best. Yeah.
272.0,279.0,Interviewer,Aw. So it sounds like you do clinical and research?
279.0,280.75,Subject,Yeah.
280.75,281.0,Interviewer,How does that work?
281.0,427.0,Subject,"So the research is typically done on campus. You go and you work with either faculty or other students to produce some research. And the clinical affiliation is just for developing the skill set to be an occupational therapist. Some schools do have you do research based on patients and stuff like that. But because we're not licensed clinicians yet, it's really hard to get IRB approval for that sort of thing. And it's really hard to get enough participants and to get actual licensed clinicians to want to supervise just some guy who's in school who's like, ""Oh, I want to study this."" They don't want to waste their time with that. Yeah. I did research on concussions for my master's. We broke up into three-- and my cohort broke up into three classes for research. And my class was all about concussion. And we split ourselves up based on populations who were vulnerable. So worked with athletes, students who were receiving accommodations on campus. And my group, we were dealing with military students, so that's the cadets and the veterans who come back. We had the lowest response rate of all of them. We literally had 18 people fill out the forms. And we tried to do a bunch of statistical testing, but you can't really do that. And we ended up not so much focusing on the results of our survey so much as the psychosocial history behind it, why they didn't want to respond. It wasn't just that they didn't want to fill out pen-and-paper surveys. There's a whole thing in the military. They don't trust anybody who's not a service member. They don't trust anybody with their information. They're dealing with trauma. If you're in ROTC, you can actually be completely disqualified immediately if you have a concussion. And so like, ""Oh, have you had a history of concussion?"" Immediately, they're like, ""Nope,"" because they don't want it to come back to their supervisors that they had a concussion. And we presented the research, first, at a state OT conference up in Nyack like a month ago. And then we also presented the research this week, actually, the day of my pinning ceremony. The first part is you present your research, then you have your party. Yeah. But--"
427.0,428.0,Interviewer,So you got a party too?
428.0,485.0,Subject,"Yeah. But the thing is, normally, the junior OTs, the OT students, I should say, who are the first and second years, will coordinate it, but nobody chipped in. So [the?] current OT student body president was like-- he's not very good. And then the vice president has a real attitude. And they completely botched all of the forms they needed to submit for the budget. And we found this out the day they were going to submit it, which was the last day to submit the budget. So we, me and my friend, had to go in and retool the whole thing and redo it from scratch, come up with a new budget, come up with a new everything. Then we had to figure out about the decorations and ordered those. And it ended up being mostly us decorating instead of the first, second, and third years doing it, which is how it's supposed to be. It came out nice, but it was still just like, mostly, we coordinated our own party."
485.0,488.0,Interviewer,That sounds like a success.
488.0,489.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah."
489.0,497.0,Interviewer,"That's great. So you got your pin, right? Does that mean you're graduated, or do you still have more left?"
497.0,520.0,Subject,"So unofficially, I've graduated. They recognize me as graduating. But I still have to present my capstone stuff on Monday. And then I have an exam on the 19th, yeah, the 19th, and that's going to be a big pain in the butt because that's like four hours long."
520.0,521.0,Interviewer,Four hours?
521.0,550.0,Subject,"Yeah. They make it so it'll be like a practice certification exam. And they want you to have the best possible chance of passing the actual thing, so they make you take a full-on practice one right before you graduate. And the thing is, they also do that for the third years right before they go out to fieldwork just to see where they're at, and it's not graded. For us, if you don't pass it, you don't pass the class, and you have to retake it. And I'm like, ""But you told me I graduated."" Yeah."
550.0,551.0,Interviewer,That is [sad?].
551.0,559.75,Subject,"It's not the most fun thing in the world. But, I mean, when I took it at the beginning of this year, I was three points away from passing, and that was without doing any studying whatsoever--"
559.75,560.0,Interviewer,That's great.
560.0,570.0,Subject,"--taking it cold. I was like, ""Okay."" I was going to panic and be all upset about it. And then I remembered my score at the beginning of the semester, and I was like, ""All right. You know what? It's fine. I'll study a little bit, and I'll pass."""
570.0,580.0,Interviewer,Nice. So will you go for your certification? Will you take the test for real after you graduate?
580.0,624.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I have to get my diploma first, but CUNY is very funny about that. Especially around the winter time, they like to take their sweet time because they have Christmas coming up, understandably. Then they've got New Year's and then whatever happens that they typically don't give you your diploma till the middle of January. And you need the diploma to be able to-- you need the diploma to prove to the certification body that you completed your education. Then, from there, I want to study because I'm not just going to take it with three weeks of studying. It's based on four years of education, so you've got to put in a little-- like a month or two of studying for that. But then I've got job offers, so."
624.0,625.0,Interviewer,Already? Wow.
625.0,655.0,Subject,"Yeah. Like I said, I really threw myself at that second site. I did everything I could. I was endlessly bothering all of the OTs. Even the rehab director, who only treats one patient a day, I was like, ""No, how do you-- what are doing? How do you do this? Show me. Can I help you? Let me do that."" I got into doing all the wheelchair repairs and stuff when the wheelchair guy wasn't there. And so I made myself as useful as possible, tried to have fun. And, as a result, they offered me a job on the spot. And I was like, ""Thank you, but I still have to finish school."""
655.0,656.0,Interviewer,"Oh, but it really paid off."
656.0,657.0,Subject,Yeah. It was--
657.0,662.0,Interviewer,That's wonderful. Do you think you'll take the job once you graduate?
662.0,678.0,Subject,"I would like to see what else is out there, but I'll very likely be taking that job just because I had a lot of fun there. And even if skilled nursing facilities aren't the most ethical, and they have crazy productivity standards, and they--"
678.0,679.0,Interviewer,Ethical?
679.0,790.0,Subject,"They have you doing a lot of billing that's not quite right. It's not quite compliant with Medicare and Medicaid. And the productivity standards, they're usually pretty insane. So most skilled nursing is somewhere between 75 and 85 percent productivity, which means from the moment you clock in, that percentage of time should be spent treating. And the closer you get to 100, the less time you have to document. But the documentation, even electronically, takes forever. And if you make mistakes, they go after you for it, and if you're closer to 100-- but they have this thing - I don't remember if it's Medicare or Medicaid - called CMI. And you pick up a lot of patients because they want to know why this or that person isn't receiving treatment. So you'd have to take on everybody because, ""Oh, we're expecting you from April till June, you need to have as-- you take in as many people as possible."" So you end up, with evaluations or anything like that, seeing like 15 people a day. But now they've recently changed the laws, so they don't tell you when they're doing CMI. It used to be two blocks during the year. Now it's anytime, so you find out later that you messed up, like your facility finds out. So now it's CMI all the time, so you're constantly at over 100 percent productivity rate, which is not humanly possible. It's not legal. It's not ethical. But it's what the facilities want, so. But I still enjoy it, seeing a lot of people like that and working with them, and it's every single time. When I'm working with a stroke patient, I have a pretty firm grasp on the neuroscience and all of the biomechanics of it and how the rehabilitation techniques work. But every time, I swear to God, it looks like magic. I'm like, ""No way. You couldn't even lift your arm like three weeks ago. Oh my God, you're feeding yourself. How did that happen?"""
790.0,792.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How does it?
792.0,857.0,Subject,"There's so much about neuroplasticity. But even if I look at it and I see it, I'm just like, ""I know what's going on, but I still can't believe it's happening."" There's all sorts of stuff that I've learned. Disuse, psychologically and then neurologically, your body not only loses the connections to the muscles but also forgets that you can use those muscles at all. So it's not just that the neurons lost blood supply and shut down. It's also that your brain basically forgets that the neurons were even there and that you could use that in motor patterns and motor planning. And so you've got to take a two-pronged approach to it. You've got to teach the person-- you've got to rehabilitate the muscles and the nerves through activity. But also, you're teaching the brain that, ""Hey, you've got all these pathways to do all this other stuff. Don't forget about that."" And eventually, it comes together, and you start to get motor movement, then you can start to work on the motor patterns and stuff like that."
857.0,861.0,Interviewer,So how do you accomplish the two-pronged--?
861.0,925.0,Subject,"They're usually concurrent just because the beauty of activity is that that's what your brain understands. So if you have them practicing bathing or feeding or dressing, they're using the muscles, and they're activating the nerves. And even if it's coming from the tips of your fingers and trying to make its way to your brain, your brain still sees that you're making this effort, and it goes, ""Wait a minute. What's going on?"" And there's a lot of different theories about how the reconnection actually happens. Some people say it's like this thing with mirror neurons that are monkey see, monkey do, except on a neurological level. And your brain starts to go like, ""Oh, yeah,"" and it kind of starts looking for the neurons and starts reestablishing the connection. But if you're doing something that's a little bit more hocus-pocus like mirror therapy, where you have them with a mirror covering the affected side, and then you have them doing activities, that's more of a focusing on the neurological learned disuse and not the psychological component of it."
925.0,927.0,Interviewer,"Oh, like the phantom limb thing? Right. Yeah. The mirror."
927.0,982.0,Subject,"Yeah. I've done it for phantom limb pain exactly once, and I couldn't believe that it worked for the guy. But then I've used it for stroke patients more than that, and it's kind of crazy. You can do all sorts of different things. You can do even sensory stimulation. So if they issues with loss of sensation-- because strokes can come in different forms. You can have a little bit of motor function loss but a lot of sensory loss. And, in that case, you could still do sensory rehabilitation. You try to touch both hands with, say, a brush or something like that. And because your brain sees that there's brushing going on, it starts to project that sensation onto the other limb. And then, eventually, it actually does form a genuine connection to the brain and starts to reestablish the sensation. Even saying that, when you see it, it's like, ""No way that works. No way."""
982.0,983.0,Interviewer,That's incredible.
983.0,985.0,Subject,Yeah. It's the best.
985.0,989.0,Interviewer,Wow. So it sounds like you spend a lot of time with stroke patients.
989.0,1019.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's one of the primary patients you'll see in skilled nursing because they're there for long-term care. They get discharged from a hospital, but, for whatever reason, they have too many needs that can't be met by the family. Typically, you'll see older folks who have had stroke will be there. You see a lot of dementia patients as well. You can't work as many miracles with them. But I really do enjoy working with the stroke patients. It's like magic every single time."
1019.0,1026.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So do you have to have a specific specialty when you leave?
1026.0,1119.0,Subject,"No. The beauty of OT is that you're trained to have a broad base of knowledge. And then you get trained further on site, depending on where you go, and you develop experience. And if you get supervised or if you go to continuing competency classes, they'll teach you more. But you don't need to have too much of an intense specialty. You can if you want later down the road. My supervisor was talking about-- because he had just become an occupational therapist like three years ago, so he had just started to require continuing ed, because the first three years it's a grace period. But he needed to do something. And something that would clear out all your continuing ed requirements is the stroke rehabilitation specialty training. And he went for that, and he shared the materials with me. And I'm not even kidding, it's like thousands of pages of how to use things, like Kinesio Taping for if you have something with your scapula, and how to do certain mirror therapy in the most advanced ways, and how to do certain things like the most evidence-based physical rehab, ways to shape occupations to have the best impact on the brain, and all of this crazy deep neurological stuff, and reviewing all of the evidence. I'm not even kidding. They basically wrote their own book, and then had tons of articles to support it. And they just walk you through every single thing of this. I didn't get the training, but you can do that."
1119.0,1120.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk] knowledge. Yeah.
1120.0,1130.0,Subject,"Yeah. And it's so crazy and so cool. I would like to do that sort of thing, but I've still not decided if I want to specialize with just stroke."
1130.0,1133.0,Interviewer,What else is out there?
1133.0,1174.0,Subject,"So they have mental health, so that can take a lot of different forms. We're not entirely sure, as a profession, what it means because there's so few mental health OTs anymore. Ever since Creedmoor got shut down and a couple of-- and the New York State Psychiatric Institute used to have occupational therapists, but I think they have like two now for the entire hospital, which is just not conducive to effective therapy when you have that many patients. When I was working at a homeless shelter, we did a lot of group and one-on-one interventions, where you go into someone's apartment and you help them work on their life skills. It gets confused a lot of the time with psychotherapy."
1174.0,1178.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So life skills?
1178.0,1227.0,Subject,"So that's just like a broad category for ADLs, IADLs. So can they feed themselves? Can they make meals? Can they balance their budget? Can they dress themselves? Can they shower properly? Are they having appropriate social skills? Can they navigate New York City? Can they get on the subway properly? Do they need to apply-- typically, people ask us, ""Oh, you can help me get a job, right?"" Mental health, we sometimes do that. We don't go through all that stuff, but we'll do role-playing for job interviews, We can help you work on your resume a little bit if literacy and organization is not your strong point. But we're trying to develop those skills. We're not just trying to get you employed. We want you to take something away so that if you do lose your job, you don't have to come to us to get another job."
1227.0,1240.0,Interviewer,Right. You teach a man to fish rather than-- wow. So you mentioned that there are interventions beyond that. What are [those?]?
1240.0,1243.0,Subject,Beyond the life skills stuff or--?
1243.0,1245.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1245.0,1391.0,Subject,"Well, so outside of mental health, you can work in pediatrics. And that's typically school based, although sometimes you make home visits for kids. Kids who need home care typically are pretty involved. They've have cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis or some really life-changing illness. Or you can work in neonatal intensive care unit. Some OTs do that because a child with, say, cerebral palsy will have issues when they're born, and they might not have all their reflexes integrated. They might not have the suck-swallow reflex, which they desperately need to be able to eat. And you can actually work with that. And I don't know the specifics of it, but one of my teachers was talking about there's a way to stimulate the cheeks of an infant, and it'll help facilitate the suck-swallow reflex. And eventually, the muscles and the nerves get the message like, ""Hey, come on. Let's go. You need to be able to do this,"" and then they start to develop that reflex. You can also work with-- oh, boy, there's just so much. There's brain injury specialists. There's spinal cord injury specialists. I think upstate they have a hospital just for people with spinal cord injury. And the OTs who work with them are so crazily smart, and they're on the ball about it because they have to be very specialized with that sort of injury. And every level of this medical work has different implications for what you can and can't do, and what is and isn't safe for therapy. Then, oh, man, there's outpatient. So that's typically hand rehabilitation, people who have hand injuries and stuff like that, and they get discharged from the hospital. They've still got a lot of lacerations. Or if they had repetitive strain injury or if they had surgery, they'll come in and you do work with them. It's actually the most boring one because you mostly just give them a hot pack or ice or a TENS unit or something, and you do a little bit of stretching or what have you. Maybe you make a splint for them, or you order a prefabricated one, and then you send them home. And then you see them like twice a week for 10 weeks, and then that's over. Yeah. It's not quite my speed. I like having a longer relationship with my clients."
1391.0,1392.0,Interviewer,You like the longer relationship?
1392.0,1454.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's part of the human connection thing, and you get to see them getting better. And even when they get worse, you're there. You can help walk them through it and not be totally dispirited by it. And I really being able to work with people in such a long-term capacity because then you also get to-- you're not just developing a relationship. You're developing your skills, and you're seeing how someone progresses, and you're adding that to your list of tricks you can pull. And the next time you see a patient, you're like, ""Oh, yeah. I just had a patient who just was like this. This worked. Let's try that."" And you would never have thought of that in a million years, but now you have that, and it's like second nature to you. Plus, I'm just kind of a softy. I really like to-- I'm kind of a people person even if I like to stay and keep to myself socially. When I'm working in a clinic, I really like to just be there for people, whether they're having a good day or a bad day. There's just something about it that I can't put my finger on, but it's amazing."
1454.0,1461.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's really nice. Do you ever-- was it hard to let go when they're better then?
1461.0,1464.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. That's been an ongoing issue for me."
1464.0,1465.0,Interviewer,Really?
1465.0,1483.75,Subject,"Yeah. Because I still think of some of my patients that I had from March, and I wonder where they're at and how they're doing. And I don't forget their stories or some of the things they've said. And I've been told that that's relatively normal in the helping professions."
1483.75,1484.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
1484.0,1521.0,Subject,"But it puts you at risk for burn out. And I've burnt out a lot on that first fieldwork not just because of the pressures that my fieldwork coordinator-- not coordinator, my field work supervisor was putting on me, but also just because I was dealing with all of my patients having all of these issues, and I was taking it home with me. And, on the second fieldwork, I was better at not taking it home with me, but I still wonder about some of my patients. I ask supervisor sometimes, but he doesn't respond. And then I realize like, ""Oh, yeah. No. It's inappropriate to ask about patients."" There's HIPAA laws. You can't [laughter] be talking about people like that, unfortunately."
1521.0,1531.0,Interviewer,"And so, if it wasn't just your supervisor, what do you think allowed you to kind of check it at the door at your second one?"
1531.0,1584.0,Subject,"I think it was experience. I already had three months of that under my belt and knowing what the warning signs were for me that I was going to take some of this home. I'm getting better at managing things like transference, countertransference, and being in an environment where I was seeing other people discharged the energy and the emotions better and more properly, because we were pretty much on our own at that first fieldwork. The OTs there just stayed in their office all day, and we were the ones who ran groups and stuff like that. They never showed us how to do any of the things, and I was like, ""If you're having an issue with me doing this, you could totally show me. It's actually, literally your job to show me how to do it properly. So who's fault is it if I mess up, and then I mess up again, and you don't show me how to do it better?"""
1584.0,1586.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean, you're there to learn, right?"
1586.0,1587.0,Subject,Yeah.
1587.0,1598.0,Interviewer,Good. Very cool. So it seems like you're kind of coming to the end of this degree. What got you started in this in the first place?
1598.0,1676.0,Subject,"So when I was working at one company that had an OT in high school, I thought it was really cool. And I thought I wanted to be a teacher for the longest time, then I thought I wanted to be a clinical psychologist. But I fidget a lot, and that's really bad for a clinical psychologist to have tics and stuff like that. And it's distracting for the patient. They think you're not listening and all that sort of stuff. And I started looking into occupational therapy because you get to move around all day. Even if it's exhausting, you have the long-term relationship. You're doing some teaching, but you're also allowed to move around and be weird. And when I got to college, I saw the OT program at my college was very good. And I started asking questions to students and the faculty, and I decided then and there I definitely wanted to do that. So from like 2011 on, I've just been pursuing this like a dog. I'm just like, ""Oh my God. I want to be an occupational therapist. I want to be an occupational therapist."" And here we are, and I think it's a pretty straightforward story, honestly. I saw it. I was like, ""Yeah. It's something I know I'll be good at, and it's something that my quirks and everything won't be the total downfall of the therapeutic relationship."""
1676.0,1686.0,Interviewer,You found your calling. That's wonderful. And what was going on before that?
1686.0,1728.0,Subject,"Well, before that, it was just high school, so it was typical existential dread. I was like, ""Who am I? What am I? Do I like boys? Do I like girls? Do I like anime? Do I like TV? Do I like newspapers? Do I like food?"" And then also, ""What am I going to be when I grow up?"" And then you grow up, and you get to college. I mean, it's like, ""Okay. Well, what am I going to major in? What am I going to-- what do I think I'll be good at, and what interests me?"" And OT also happens to have all the classes that I'm interested in. So you got your anatomy, and you've got your neuroscience, and you've got some psychosocial stuff, and how to actually run groups, and how to do some therapeutic stuff, and how to do physical interventions. And I was like, ""Oh my God. Sign me up for all of that. I want to know everything."""
1728.0,1733.0,Interviewer,Wow. So this came into your life pretty early?
1733.0,1747.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm always a little bit ashamed to tell people that I've wanted to do that since high school because, as far as I understand it, a lot of people who say they wanted to do something in high school never end up doing that thing."
1747.0,1748.0,Interviewer,Really?
1748.0,1774.0,Subject,"Yeah. Some of my friends were like, ""Oh, I want to be a teacher,"" in high school, and they're not anywhere near a teaching degree now. One of my friends, who said she was going to be a teacher, she's a licensed massage therapist. It's like, ""The thing you wanted to do when you enter high school or when you graduate high school or when you enter college is never what you end up with."" So when I tell people that, I'm always a little bit like, ""Oh, man. I held onto it, like I didn't grow up or something."" You know?"
1774.0,1776.0,Interviewer,That's good. That's perseverance.
1776.0,1783.0,Subject,"I guess. For me, it just feels a little bit like I didn't grow up just a little, like I held onto the childhood dream or something."
1783.0,1785.0,Interviewer,Dreams?
1785.0,1786.0,Subject,"Yeah, I guess. I mean--"
1786.0,1787.0,Interviewer,It's reality.
1787.0,1816.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's still a little hard to think about it. I was like, ""Oh my God. I'm actually the guy who did the thing now. I'm actually going to be an OT. Oh my God."" I'm still processing that fact too. It's like when I went into the clinical stuff, I was so happy the whole time because it was like, ""Oh my God. I'm doing the thing."" But now, I'm kind of [stoned?]. I'm like, ""Oh my God. I am actually going to do the thing. I am passing. I am going to make it and be treating people this time next year."""
1816.0,1818.0,Interviewer,You're so surprised?
1818.0,1842.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't know. I don't know why I didn't think I would make it. But there's always a little doubt in me that's like, ""Hey, this might not work out."" I'm finding out, ""Yeah. I'm actually totally capable of doing this thing."" And it's something that I wanted and I'm actually getting and feeling that I actually can do this and that I'm good at it, relatively, for an entry-level clinician, of course."
1842.0,1846.0,Interviewer,But you still have the doubt?
1846.0,1885.0,Subject,"Yeah, a little bit. I'm not doubting that I'll pass my boards. And I know I'm not going to be the best clinician out the gates. Nobody's the best when they start. But there's always a doubt like, ""Am I going to be good enough for this? Am I going to be good enough for my patients?"" Never mind holding down the job, just I want to do right by these people. If you actually need occupational therapy, there is a problem in your life. It might not be a huge problem, but there's a problem, and it's not fun to have a lot of problems. So I want to do right by people who are having that sort of issue."
1885.0,1887.0,Interviewer,Right by people?
1887.0,1919.0,Subject,"I want to do them justice. If you're having trouble with, say, feeding and dressing yourself because you had a stroke, it doesn't seem fair to be given someone who doesn't know what they're doing, isn't doing it well, doesn't communicate with you, and doesn't bother giving you the time of day outside of the clinic. They just put you on an arm bike, and then they have you lifting weights. That doesn't seem fair. I want to give these people my best."
1919.0,1921.0,Interviewer,"Well, it sounds like you're well on your way."
