0.0,6.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,59.0,Subject,"Good. I think good. I've been really preoccupied since I've been taking exams. So it's kind of a particularly busy period, but good. I guess since I've lost my phone it's been kind of an exceptional period because it's made me think a lot about the relationship between my life and my phone. I don't know if that's too much for the first answer. But I guess one of the things I've been thinking about a lot lately is, since I lost my phone, I've felt much more isolated because I couldn't use my phone to pass the time or preoccupy myself, which made me feel like I need to deepen my relationships. But at the same time, I felt like I need my phone because I can't contact people. So I don't know. That's kind of how I've been. Yeah. I don't know. I could keep talking [laughter]."
59.0,60.75,Interviewer,So you said deepen your relationships?
60.75,61.0,Subject,Yeah.
61.0,63.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by that?
63.0,105.0,Subject,"I just thought, oh, I could have a more-- I could just reach out more to people. I could do more things for people, be more thoughtful, stuff like that. Show up to people's events, all of that kind of stuff. Because I realized my phone-- or I would listen to stuff while I ate lunch as opposed to eat lunch with a friend. And when I lost my phone, suddenly I was like, ""I wish I had a friend to eat with"", stuff like that. Which, of course, I couldn't text them anyway."
105.0,113.0,Interviewer,Okay. So you lost your phone. I think you must know the story. I don't know the-- No? Okay.
113.0,211.0,Subject,"I didn't lose my phone. Actually, my phone, I had dropped it. I had started losing service, and then it just wouldn't turn on, and it was just kind of a whole thing to get it back, and it's fine now. But yes, my mother was really anxious about it, as well. And so it ended up-- I actually just saw her this weekend at a Christmas party, and then she brought the whole box to this fancy ballroom, and then we were working on it together. And yeah, I think-- yeah, if I'm thinking more generally about my emotional state, I think I'm at a point in my life where I feel very complacent, and I'm trying to find things to do. So I think right now in my life, I'm a little-- I don't know, I'm a little bored, and I want something more exciting, something more - I don't know - emotionally exciting, if exciting is an emotion. I think, yeah, I don't know. I think one of the things-- I guess especially since we last spoke with Dr. Benevides is that I've been realizing the extent to which I've been avoiding a lot of emotional experiences because I'm just worried about what's going to happen. And so I think one of the things that's been developing in the weeks since is sort of, ""Oh, I should put myself out there more and try new things,"" and stuff like that. And for me, that probably means I have to go somewhere else because I think here, I'm just in routines, and I'm very constrained. Stuff like that. Yeah. That's kind of what I've been thinking about."
211.0,216.0,Interviewer,So what kind of routines do you think you're rooted in?
216.0,289.0,Subject,"I think, in part, it's I've been going to school for a long time. And you both went to college, or maybe in med school, or whatever. I don't know the situation. But I think definitely after a while, you start to feel like, as I'm taking exams I'm just like, ""Again. Here I go again."" And I'm tired of being stressed about this grade. It just seems so nebulous at some point, and there seems to be much more important things going on that I should be doing something about. So I think there's-- and I also think definitely my work has been a way to avoid other problems. So I feel as if I could live in my apartment forever and just keep taking classes at school - and I really enjoy it - but I also think I need some kind of challenge or friction. And in some ways, that's the most privileged statement of all time, obviously, because most people wish they had less friction. But I think I'm trying to break some sense of banality, I guess. Yeah, I feel like if I'm not getting deep enough relationships, maybe I just need to go somewhere else that's going to be more fitting because that's varied. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I would say, yeah."
289.0,291.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by going somewhere else?
291.0,449.0,Subject,"Like physically going somewhere else. This summer, I traveled abroad for the first time by myself extensively, and there was definitely a real sense of freedom in that. And I realized I was more willing to do things that I probably wouldn't do here, or just I explored more and I just felt a little less burdened by things. And so I would like to find a way to maybe go somewhere far away from what I know because I think that would be a beneficial thing. Maybe trying in some ways, but I think it would be good. Yeah. So I'd just mean moving, basically. Yeah. And if I could just go on here. And yet at the same time, though, it's like as I-- I'm trying to think. I've gone to three schools in my life now. Three schools, as in grammar school, high school, college, and I've realized my habits haven't changed. So in some sense, I'm skeptical of my idea of, ""Oh, I'll just go somewhere else again."" I'm just like, ""This seems to be a pattern."" So I think that's another thing as I enter adulthood. It's like what things are fixed in my life and what is my attitude towards them? It's like sometimes I sort of-- I think about all things, and I'm like, ""Oh, I would love to do that."" But I'm like, ""Obviously, you wouldn't love to do that because you would do that."" I usually pursue the things I want. I'm not a loafer really. I take pretty hard classes, but I enjoy them. And I'm just like, ""Oh, I should be more social. I should go to a party."" But I'm just like, ""I don't like going to parties. Why am I beating myself up over this?"" So I think that's another kind of place of real conflict because people-- my parents are like, ""Oh, you should do more."" They don't know anything, but they just tell me these things. Yeah, things that are, I guess, considered socially acceptable-- when I didn't have my phone, in some ways it was a real relief because I was like, ""Oh, I'm definitely not always checking it all the time."" And I know I did other things as a result, and there were things that I missed like I missed being close to music as I walked. But at the same time, I was more attentive to other things that were happening around me. But my parents thought it was strange. They were like, ""You have to have a phone."" So, I guess, there's a certain level of what things do you decide to conform to, or what risks am I willing to take to pursue things that I might want, and what am I going to lose as result of that, I guess? I guess that's another thing. Yeah."
449.0,454.0,Interviewer,So your parents said that you should have a phone?
454.0,550.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think that's a parental thing. My mom really doesn't want to-- obviously, [inaudible] 19, and my mom wants to make sure we keep a connection. So do I. So I think she feels really anxious about being able to reach me all the time. So not having a phone, obviously, is a major barrier to that. Yeah. But I think for them, also, they just think it's strange, too. I think they, sometimes, feel like they want-- I'm sure as a parent-- I think I'm supposed to keep talking. So usually I don't do this. But I think I imagine, as a parent, you want your child to be socially successful. And I know my mother, especially, has a lot of anxiety, but I think them together comparing their children is, they want to see signs that their children are thriving. So I think the idea that-- I think sometimes when I don't have a phone, or something like that, or I went somewhere by myself, that's a point of concern for them. And I understand that. So I think, in part, they're very concerned that I might become too reclusive. So I think they really push me, in whatever way they can, which isn't really many at all, to try to do whatever they want, basically, or what they would think would be good for me. Yeah, I think that's the thing. Yeah."
550.0,556.0,Interviewer,And what do you think it is that they actually want for you?
556.0,716.0,Subject,"I don't know. It's hard to tell. It's not a cliche, like I want to do something creative and they want me to become a lawyer. I think they just want to make sure I'm materially-- I think at the most benevolent level, or the most caring, loving level, is they just want to make sure I'm socially - successful isn't the right word because that's too corporate - but just socially okay and materially okay. That I'm just a person with a good life who's functioning well. And I think at another level, they're concerned in terms of-- to some extent, your relationship with your parents is also a material one. So I think there's a certain idea that if I don't make enough money, the whole family together like them, eventually, maybe, I'll pay for things for them and stuff like that. So I think they're concerned about that. And I feel the same thing simultaneously. It's like, what do you owe your parents? I don't know. Something, maybe. Maybe nothing. And so to what extent-- how much freedom do I want, but to what extent is that an ethical choice? Because I can't just be like, ""Screw you,"" and not pick up the phone. They're paying for me to go to college. So yeah, I don't know. It's hard. It's a really-- I have a lot of ambivalence about it. I think they love me, and I think they want the best for me but I also think, sometimes, what they think is good, I think is wrong. And that's like every parent-child relationship in the history of the world. And so when my dad keeps telling me that I need to get a LinkedIn page, I'm like, ""Dad, I don't want one. I'm not going to do it. Stop telling me."" Especially now, they keep being like, ""Oh, you should talk to this person. You should talk to this person."" I'm just like, ""I don't want to talk to this person."" I don't have anything to say to them, and I feel grateful, and I know that people don't have parents that give them contacts to people, obviously. So I don't want to just be complaining about it, but I'm just like, ""You need to let me make the contacts I want to make."" So, yeah. And so it's difficult to navigate that, and I think for them, too. Because they want to feel like they're helping me and also to make sure that I'm heading in whatever direction they want me to go. Yeah. That's what I'd say. So that's a lot of parent stuff. I can talk about something else."
716.0,726.0,Interviewer,"So when you say that they may want different things than you do, or that they are pushing you in a slightly different direction, what is the direction that you want?"
726.0,874.0,Subject,"I don't know. I'm not sure. I just want to do something that doesn't feel so linear. I have to take this philosophy class for school, so you could say, ""Oh, it's so teleological,"" but it just means a purpose. And I just feel like so much of my life is pointing somewhere, and you do this-- and school's designed that way, like, oh, you ascend. Obviously, most people don't go to college. I think it's a third or something. But you go this grade, this grade, this grade, this grade, the course numbers get higher in college, and then it's-- I guess that's one of the things I feel like. I thought about applying to grad school. It's just kind of the only thing I know. So I just keep going, and I don't know what you do when you get to the end of that. But I would like to do something that feels like it doesn't have to point somewhere ahead because I feel like definitely my conversations with my dad-- I feel like most of the time, dads are the career people. Maybe that's sexist, in gender, there's a lot to, maybe, unpack there. But my dad feels like he wants to give me career advice, and I'm just like, ""I don't even like the idea of having a career all the time."" I don't want to feel like I'm doing things to keep going to the next thing because then-- I don't know. It's just really depressing, and it also just means that you're constantly at the whim of other people's opinions, and judgments, and prestige, and how that's culturally organized. And that's really exhausting all the time. And I'm sure everyone feels that. I don't think that's exceptional. I just think I want to do something, I really want to do something, at least-- maybe that's what everyone wants to do in their twenties, but I really want to do something that at least feels, for the moment, like I don't have to be pursuing it all the time. Because that's definitely what I've been doing up to this point, consciously or not, and I feel like in order to, at least, have a sense of what it would be like to be free of that, I have to take some kind of risk that I haven't been willing to take yet, in some way. Yeah."
874.0,876.0,Interviewer,A risk?
876.0,1123.0,Subject,"Yeah, something that would not be so obvious for me to do. Like to go somewhere really different, where my family has never lived before, to just take on some job that isn't very typical of what everyone-- at any college, they have career fairs, and all the companies come, and everyone's applying, it just feels like the same-- it just feels like going to college fairs in high school. And then, I'm sure, at career fairs, it's like a networking fair, and then it's just like fairs, fairs, fairs. I just don't want to do that. I just can't. I don't think I can make any complaints about being emotionally dissatisfied or all the things I talked about with you and Dr. Benevides, without really trying something new. Because right now, I'm just perpetuating the same things. This is, though-- this is too [careerist?]. One of the other things I've been-- I keep thinking about Dr. Benevides's comment-- it's Benevides, right? Okay. It was really funny. When I was, as now, just going off about my internal emotions, and I had said, ""Oh, I really don't like to be the center of attention."" And she said, she's like, ""Well, you're the center of attention right now."" And I was like, ""Oh, I guess maybe I do."" But, I guess, I have a lot of concerns, also, about the idea of taking a risk being a narcissistic pursuit, as well. In the sense that you're going to be this individual, like, ""No man is an island,"" blah, blah, blah. And just, I don't know. I think I have a lot of-- I don't know how I want to establish my relationships to people over the long-term. Who is going to be my deep, close friend in my life? Am I going to have that friend? Do people have those friends? And I think that's another question of-- because, I guess, part of the thing is definitely as I think about my high school friends who are all in college right now, as well, is there are certain social circles you operate in. There's always articles coming out about how people like to date people in the same economic range who go to kind of similar schools, stuff like that. And it makes sense, right? Because all my friends start with the jobs they're going to, it's all kind of the same thing more or less. In some sense, I know that-- maybe it's not true, but I feel, at least, or I suspect, that in order to maintain those relationships, there are certain things I have to do. So that one of the most popular things to do at Columbia is to go into consulting. It may not be quite the most popular job, but it's definitely among them. And that's, also, really popular for humanity students. And so I know that if I stay in those circles, then maybe I'll be able to keep up relationships with people. But it's a question of sacrifice. Yeah, I think that's it. It's a question about sacrifice, and the things you're willing to sacrifice to do what you want, and also, what are the ethics of that. Because sometimes I might be like, oh, sacrificing your relationships. That can be a jerky thing to do. What kind of sacrifice is that if you're just doing what you want all the time? So what duties do I have to other people who I know and don't? Yeah, sorry."
1123.0,1125.0,Interviewer,"So, also to those that you don't know?"
1125.0,1256.0,Subject,"Yeah, I think you have a duty to people you don't know in some way. I'm not sure what it is, but if you think about people in need, stuff like that, like larger structural issues, I think you have some duty to do something about that. Maybe you don't. I don't know. People probably argue about that. But I think that-- I find it hard to believe-- I could sit in my apartment and read pretty much for eternity. I'm pretty happy doing that, but I'm sure that's not the right choice. But I also think it's socially coded in lots of ways, as well. Because one of the things at my high school is everyone-- because to be an ethical person, it can be kind of constructed. So one of the things in my high school is that almost everyone becomes a lawyer, and that's kind of considered the mark of-- it's not said, but it obviously is considered the mark of a good person. Certain things are considered frivolous, like certain jobs that you take on, certain thing that-- people ask me all the time when I'm studying literature, they're like, ""What are you going to do with that? What is that?"" There are stereotypes of seeing literature, art, whatever that might be, as an indulgent pursuit. I hope it's not. So I think, also, when I think about oh, being a good person, I'm not sure if that just means being a stereotypical kid of the upper-middle class, and oh, that would be ethical because oh, then you go to a good college, you go to a good law school, and then you pay for your parent's stuff, and then you die. It's more complicated than that. I know. But, I guess, I feel like people are probably going to perceive you as unethical if you do things that they don't expect you to do, and so I'm trying to create an independent sense of that. That's hard, and this is incoherent, but that's what I'm struggling to describe. Yeah. I feel really weird right now."
1256.0,1267.0,Interviewer,"Sorry, I was just taking in everything that you said. It's very interesting, actually. But you said that in high school, almost everyone became a lawyer or like are becoming--?"
1267.0,1287.0,Subject,"Not everyone, but I was on a debate team in high school, and so that was a really popular thing to do. And it was a really big debate team. So almost everyone there-- he actually said that, my debate coach/teacher. He said, he's like, ""When you all go to law school."" So yeah, it's changing now, but yeah."
1287.0,1290.0,Interviewer,And that's not something that you're studying now. You said literature?
1290.0,1445.0,Subject,"Law? Yeah, I've thought about going to law school, maybe. I don't know what that would even mean. I don't have as much-- I think at the end of high school, I had much more antipathy towards that because maybe I was trying to define myself. And now, I feel I have a question about it. I'm not sure. Yeah, I'm not opposed to it. I don't know. It's just about-- I'm just not sure how genuinely interested I am in it, as opposed to the idea that I think that if I went there, that people would consider me a successful and good person. I'm just like, I'm going to help people with the law. But also, I guess, one of the things is I think, definitely-- I took a great class this semester which I won't bore you with the details. But it was one of the things that came out in a lot of the books is-- which were mostly about colonialism. Most of the books were describing working-class, lower-class life, but it's also about, many of them are talking about the extent to which what you do begins to shape you as a person, which makes total sense. Of course, if I go to law school. You don't just go as a person, and then go through that unchanged. So that certain things will start to change and happen. So I feel a lot of anxiety about making those choices because it's just like the sell-out trope. You go in thinking you're going to do this thing, and then you convince yourself all these other things are good, and then, suddenly, you end up being like, ""What?"" Or maybe you just don't even realize it. And so I guess that's it, right? That I, even now - you must feel this - even now, I'm certainly not the same person I was four years ago, and that's because I'm in different places with different people. And that can be positive and negative. So it's hard, I think, with the question of, what do you do. That's like you put on your business card or whatever, your LinkedIn profile is, I guess, the thing that is preeminent for most of us. Just for whatever reason, critique it. Who cares. I guess that's why I feel such deep anxiety about it. Like when you say, ""I am X."" Like, ""I am a teacher. I am whatever."" What's mine going to be? And why does it have to be one thing? I don't know. Yeah, it's hard."
1445.0,1447.0,Interviewer,"Well, it doesn't have to be one thing."
1447.0,1492.0,Subject,"I guess it doesn't. But people will ask you. I guess that's why I feel that. I don't know. One cannot become a-- what's a good example? You can't be - maybe you can, I don't know, you can tell me - a painter and a psychologist, you know? You have limited time as a human being. You can't just do-- I can't also live somewhere else and go to law school. I have to make choices at some point. It's definitely something I felt as an undergrad. It's like, ""Oh, I would like to take all these classes,"" but I can only take five. So you have to fit that in, right? Sorry. I feel so weird about this. I want that to be recorded. Yeah."
1492.0,1495.0,Interviewer,It's on the record.
1495.0,1503.0,Subject,"I've never talked this much about myself just straight. Yeah, I don't know."
1503.0,1506.0,Interviewer,"Well, so you're studying literature now? What made you do that?"
1506.0,1600.0,Subject,"Yeah, I study literature. It's just always what I've liked, I guess. I like to think that certain things can happen in books that can't happen when you talk to people. I read this great book over the summer. I usually read fiction, but I try to read nonfiction, as well. He talked about how-- he was Neil Postman, and he talks about how the rise of literary culture, as opposed to oral culture, allows for political dissidence because people-- it was really interesting. Because he says that people, of course, are willing to say things when they're not in front of people that like, oh, Martin Luther, he posts the thing. It's in writing because, of course, it's not acceptable to challenge things like that. I think it has interesting parallels with internet culture and how people are willing to say things. And it's like, that's totally true. But it also means that really exciting things can happen at the same time, like the idea of us all sitting around the table together also means, probably, that we're just going to do the things that are expected of us at the table. That's not about me, but yeah. I don't know. I think, also, yeah, that's why I love literature. My friends in high school said I would be an English major. They always said that to me. They kind of teased me about it, but that's okay. And they were totally right. But, yeah."
1600.0,1604.0,Interviewer,"Well, you said you changed so much in four years, but maybe not. Maybe you were--"
1604.0,1611.75,Subject,"Well, this is my conflict. Yeah."
1611.75,1612.0,Interviewer,How do you--
1612.0,1813.0,Subject,"I might-- sorry, go ahead. It's really interesting, also, the way that studies are gendered, too, right? So I think it's really fascinating that I think maybe my pursuit of literature also has to do with social norms around that and kind of the idea of being a real man, like all that stuff. And so I think that's another thing is I don't want to emerge like a fool. And so I think that's why when people keep asking me what I want to do, I feel I don't have something to say. I want to be in control because I was always sort of stereotyped as-- not stereotyped, but maybe just accurately observed, as just being a bit too ditzy, not able to do many tasks, not independent enough, yeah, stuff like that. And I guess I've always struggled to assert myself in front of other people. I feel very nervous. So I guess that's also the reason I like literature, but also the reason I feel like I want to do things that feel socially normal. I had a friend who, I thought, made the really poignant observation about why certain people do well in school as opposed to others. One thing, I guess, is even doing well in school is even a gendered phenomenon, especially at a young age. Because at a young age, I was always the only boy. It was always the girls, and now looking back on that, I really feel like my school failed a lot of the boys in our class. Because it was clear that if only one in ten boys is doing academically, then you must be doing something wrong. There has to be some dynamic at play, and I think that's in part because the stereotypes that, ""Girls listen, boys speak,"" kind of thing. And so I guess maybe I'm just the boy who listens, maybe not. Or boy who talks, as seen here. So that has always been a source of like, ""Oh, he's not like the other boys,"" a little bit, has been a hard theme of my life to deal with. I went to an all-boys high school so that really exaggerated it. And so this was all to say, my friend was once talking about how gay people - I'm gay - he was talking about how gay people tend to try to do better in school because he thought that they were trying to prove something about themselves because they feel like they've kind of failed in a certain social way. And I thought that was a really poignant observation. Because I could definitely see myself as a middle-schooler feeling like something was seriously wrong and trying to compensate for that in some way. And I think that has-- that's such a huge question. That's not just about my personal life and the extent to which people want to be part of a dominant culture, or want to feel like they've gotten the checkbox by other people. Yeah, and I guess that has been something I think about often."
1813.0,1817.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by a checkbox?
1817.0,1844.0,Subject,"I mean a checkbox as in people look at you, and they approve you, they affirm you. This is the same thing in the school system. I think this is definitely why I've done well in school, is because I want to receive the approval of other people. That's what it's based on. My humanities teachers, they listen to what I say. I wrote a paper, and they say, ""A. Good."" No one wants to get a C in class, maybe some people care less, but I don't think anyone pursues it. Yeah."
