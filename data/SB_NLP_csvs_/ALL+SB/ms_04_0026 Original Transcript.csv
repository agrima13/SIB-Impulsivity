2.0,85.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how has things been going for you lately? So you play guitar. How long have you been playing the guitar?
85.0,137.0,Subject,"About six months. And I really like playing. I used to play the piano, but that was-- my mom forced me to play the piano. I didn't really enjoy it. I kind of wished that I could play it-- I kind of wish that I could've enjoyed it so I could've gotten better because I like piano music, but I don't think I have the patience or the technique for the piano. Guitar, I think, it fits me more. I'm able to pick up songs pretty quickly. I was able to learn a lot more in six months than I did with two years in piano. "
137.0,145.0,Interviewer,Two years is a long time. Why did you switch?
145.0,208.0,Subject,"I was busy. I was getting busy at school. And I used that as an excuse to stop playing piano because I didn't like it. I kind of enjoyed piano until they started making me take music theory tests and forcing me to do concerts for-- because I went to kind of a music school to practice. And then they made me do concerts. I did one concert and after that, I was like, ""I'm done,"" because I really hated doing it. And I took like two years without playing any instruments. And then I worked a job and I had money. But I wasn't spending any of the money, so I was like, ""I should buy something."" So I just bought a guitar and I started playing."
208.0,213.0,Interviewer,You just decided to buy a guitar?
213.0,239.0,Subject,"I think I kind of missed playing music or I realized that-- I appreciate the sound of piano, but the majority of music that I actually listen to on a regular basis, usually involves a guitar. So it just seemed a lot more practical."
239.0,246.0,Interviewer,So what kind of music do you listen to that you're hearing the guitar in?
246.0,282.0,Subject,"I listen to mainly three genres of music. One is called post-rock. And post-rock is-- the songs tend to be long like seven to eight minutes long, and the whole point of the song is it's just one big buildup. It usually starts off kind of soft and slow and then usually around the six-minute mark it goes crazy."
282.0,284.0,Interviewer,[Crazy?]?
284.0,453.0,Subject,"It gets crazy loud. And the whole four minutes in between it was just building up to that one moment. So some people might find it boring because they're like, ""We're not going to sit through four minutes of just plucking."" They might find it pretentious, but I kind of like it and it's good for reading because it's not distracting at all. The second type of music I like is Shoegaze, which is similar to post-rock. It uses a lot of distortion and a lot of droning. And what that means is-- so in guitar, usually, you play the melodies and the chords, and then whatever notes you don't want you mute the strings. Droning is when you intentionally don't mute anything. And it just has this constant base note in the background that's like-- it usually sounds like it's tired. The song is tiring. But that's the point. I don't know if it's relaxing or if it's like tense because people have described it as both, but I like it. And then the other genre is not relaxing at all. It's called Math rock. And it's called Math rock because it's complicated. So in most pop and rock music they use a 4/4 time signature which means-- it's what a lot of us are conditioned to clap and tap our feet to. And it's a lot of what classical music and pop music-- it's all written in 4/4, and it's just the beat.  So the only comparable genre to Math rock is Jazz, and it uses polyrhythms, which means a lot of their songs aren't in 4/4. So if you tried to clap or tap your feet to a Jazz song, at some point in the song you'll probably get thrown off and your tapping won't be similar to the drums anymore because it's changing beats in the middle of the song. But Jazz doesn't do it nearly as frequently as Math rock. Math rock, it'll change every 10 or 15 seconds and it'll just be a really weird time signature that you can't even clap to. So it's called Math rock because the people playing it are always counting. And one day I want to be able to play that kind of music, but so far I haven't been able to. So yeah."
453.0,455.0,Interviewer,So you want to play that music.
455.0,461.0,Subject,I don't have the technical ability yet.
461.0,469.0,Interviewer,What do you think draws you to it?
469.0,559.0,Subject,"Well, the other two genres of music-- I usually use it for-- they're both more atmospheric, so they fit doing homework or reading; doing something else. While listening to Math rock is like you can't do anything else while listening to it because it's-- you have to be focused on the actual music or else it just sounds like trash. Honestly, it probably does to a lot of people, but that's just because they've never focused on music. And they probably never played an instrument themselves. So the majority of people I talk to, or I show them Math rock, they don't appreciate it at all besides ""Oh, that sounds really hard."" But they don't understand how hard and in what ways. So, to me, it's like-- I've listened to Math rock songs that I didn't even think sounded good. I didn't like listening to it. But then I watched live recordings of them and it doesn't matter whether I like it or not because I just appreciate that this artist was able to replicate what the recording sounded like live, and he's able to do that consecutively for every live performance. That's what matters to me."
559.0,563.0,Interviewer, And how did you find it?
563.0,705.0,Subject,"Well, Math rock-- so in guitar there's different tunings. Most people play in standard tuning because it's easy and it's not a hassle. Since the majority of songs that exist are in standard. They don't want to try different tunings because otherwise, you have to retune your guitar for each song you're playing in a set. So most guitarists they just stick to standard tuning. Math rock is almost never written in standard tuning. It's always some obscure-- so always a really weird tuning and it's a hassle, but when you play it people are like, ""I've never heard anything like that before."" And I'm like, ""Well, it's not had. It's not more difficult really. It's just I've change [laughter] the configuration."" And this isn't what most people are used to, so. What I was getting at is that it shares a lot of the same tunings as Emo music and everyone has listened to Emo music at some point like in middle school when their hormones are going crazy. And so I think I discovered it from Emo because Emo on the East Coast is different from Emo in the Midwest. If you listen to Midwest Emo there's a lot more notes. Eastern and Western Emo is just chords and really fast strumming all the way through. Midwest Emo there's a lot of individual plucking and it almost sounds like Math rock. It's a lot of notes in a regular beat than most people can understand. So Math rock takes that to the next level where it's a lot of notes and most people don't understand it."
705.0,713.0,Interviewer,Did someone kind of show you Emo and Math rock or is it something you came to on your own?
713.0,719.0,Subject,"I spend a lot of time on the internet, so I found it on my own."
719.0,725.0,Interviewer,Oh. What else do you do on the internet?
725.0,789.0,Subject,"I read a lot. So I download a lot of books illegally, like PDFs. I don't watch as many shows or movies anymore, but a lot-- when I was younger I used to do that a lot. I tried at some point to make internet friends and talk to people, but I never-- even if I get remotely close to them like I feel like we're getting somewhere, it just falls off. It's not real to me. So now, I've kind of stopped trying to make friends on the internet. I also used to play a lot of games, obsessively, a lot of games, but now, I've kind of gotten off of that. "
789.0,794.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that [is?]?
794.0,838.0,Subject,"I realized how much time I wasted playing video games. And the games I played, they weren't popular, so it was like no matter how good I got at it, there's no one to brag about it to. There's no one to talk about it to. They're all obscure. Those kinds of games. So it was a big-time investment. I enjoyed playing them, but it was just a big-time investment and I got very little out of it besides immediate gratification."
838.0,846.0,Interviewer,And you said when you tried to make friends on the internet it fell off and that it didn't seem real?
846.0,847.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
847.0,850.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by that?
850.0,891.0,Subject,"I'm not sure what I mean. It's that I can talk to someone and we can have good conversation online, but it's I've never seen you before. You say you're a guy, I don't know if you're a guy. You say you're a girl, I don't know if you're a girl. I don't know. I've kind of just stopped with private messaging people that I meet online. I still write stuff online, but mostly forums and comments. Not one-on-one conversations with people. "
891.0,894.0,Interviewer,So what is a forum?
894.0,942.0,Subject,"A forum is a thread-- it's just a place on a website dedicated to one topic, and it's designed to build a community or to find people you could talk to based on one topic. So say I'm interested in Math rock in a certain genre of music, you could go on a forum about that and you could talk to people about that. Or you could say, ""Oh, this band released this new album,"" and then you post a link."
942.0,951.0,Interviewer,And does that feel better than private messaging? What draws you to that?
951.0,1085.0,Subject,"Well, the main forums I go to are Reddit and 4chan. And I like 4chan especially., but 4chan gets made fun of a lot. And I think it's mostly because there's been a lot of controversies on 4chan due to its deregulation. There's usually moderators on a forum, like the owners of the website, to make sure people aren't being racists-- you know, like bad things that can get their site taken down. Because they're like, ""We made this site for you guys. Don't screw it up for us."" 4chan, on the other hand, wasn't just built by one person. It was this organization thing and it's from Japan. So a lot of the laws in the US-- it gets into international laws, and there's very little moderation. So if you think there's some nasty stuff on Reddit, 4chan's a lot worse because there's no one policing it. I mean, it's starting to get more restrictive, but for a long time, it was not restrictive at all. And the difference between 4chan and Reddit is that in Reddit and most forums like Reddit you have to make an account to post, so you'll have a user name. In 4chan, no one has a user name. Everyone's anonymous. So it'll be anonymous one, anonymous two, anonymous three. And every time you open a thread you're just assigned a number and you're anonymous. And I kind of like that because it doesn't feel like I'm talking to people. It feels like I'm responding to ideas. And that's more comfortable to me. [inaudible] I guess it just feels-- it doesn't feel real, but it's pleasurable. I almost don't worry about there being another person even though there is. "
1085.0,1092.0,Interviewer,Is that something that happens outside this 4chan?
1092.0,1134.0,Subject,"I mean, for a long time I used to like texting people, like my friends, a lot more than talking to them face-to-face or hanging out with them, but I think-- especially last year, I hung out a lot with friends in-person and I didn't really enjoy it. But I got better and now I-- at communicating face-to-face with friends so now I don't text people if I don't have to."
1134.0,1139.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by better?
1139.0,1165.0,Subject,"Before, it was really hard to talk to any of my friends face-to-face. But now I'm capable of doing that and I don't know if they enjoy it or if they're faking it, but people who I talk to face-to-face seem to like me, at least in my school."
1165.0,1174.0,Interviewer,And what do you think changed? How do you think you are now more able to do that?
1174.0,1256.0,Subject,"I just had a lot more social experiences. Freshman and Sophomore year I had stuff going on, which you can ask about if you want, but I had stuff going on that just made me unavailable to talk to. I didn't have time or energy to talk to anyone or make friends in Freshman and Sophomore year of high school. And also, I grew up in Brooklyn. I went to middle school in Brooklyn and now I go to high school in the Bronx. So a lot of my friends from middle school-- it's not that I don't get to see them, it's that a lot of them are-- they've developed friendships with each other more closely, whereas I've been kind of, not removed, but I've just been away, so. Some of them are even dating now. So it's nice whenever my middle school friends want to talk to me, but it also feels like they're just doing it out of pity, so..."
1256.0,1257.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]?
1257.0,1277.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, like they-- I don't know how to describe it. I really like to hang out with my middle school friends, but I also get the feeling they hang out with me out of obligation or they feel that it's obligation."
1277.0,1283.0,Interviewer,Why do you think they feel that way?
1283.0,1332.0,Subject,"It's just when we hang out, which is usually once a year-- I don't know. It's just the impression I get that they used to be more interested in me or in my thoughts and stuff when we were classmates in middle school, and now it's-- we have things we can talk about, but they're not very interested. It's like they just want to spend time with me because I say I want to, but it doesn't feel like they want to even though they say yes."
1332.0,1341.0,Interviewer,Did you find that hard or sad to switch from Brooklyn to the Bronx for high school?
1341.0,1349.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah.
1349.0,1352.0,Interviewer,How [so?]?
1352.0,1383.0,Subject,"It wasn't just the friends. It was that I liked living in Brooklyn. Now, I live in Manhattan and I commute to the Bronx. I like living in Brooklyn a lot more than Manhattan just because it's less noisy. I was familiar with my surroundings. I knew how to get around. And, yeah, it's easy to get around Manhattan, but-- I don't know. I'm just never really used to it."
1383.0,1395.0,Interviewer,And you said that Freshman and Sophomore year were hard in their own way. What do you think was-- you said the word draining. What do you think was the most draining?
1395.0,1904.0,Subject,"I had a relationship around Freshman year. It was a long-distance relationship with a girl a met at our writing program. And we became friends at the writing program and we were-- I think I was like her only friend. And so one day - when was this? - I think it was August, she told me that-- I knew she was depressed. She had depression and she was on medication, and she had really bad mood swings. And she'd told me that she was going to kill herself in November that same year. And so she told me this and then I asked her like, ""Why?"" And she gave me a whole list of reasons. That she would never achieve anything, that kind of talk. And one of the things on her list was that she would never have a boyfriend. And so I waited for a couple weeks after she told me this, and we just hung out like normal. And then eventually, I just kind of lied and said I liked her because in my mind I thought-- well if I can check off one of her boxes, it just proves her wrong. So maybe she'll rethink things. And even if it doesn't work out and she does kill herself it's like she was dead anyway [laughter]. To me, it was I couldn't just do nothing. And her parents knew she was suicidal and she was in a psych ward before, so she was-- and she had a therapist. She had everything, so it's not like I could contact a higher authority. She was already up there. So I was just doing what I thought I should do.  And so I was in this false relationship with her for a year or a year and a half, and I got her past November. And then after November, I just waited three or four more months and then I slowly broke off the relationship as I planned. And, yeah, I don't know if she's still alive. But to me, it doesn't matter. To me, it was-- I just wanted to get her past November. I was like giving her one more chance. Because I've always believed that if you want to kill yourself, you should have the ability to. To me, that's a right you should have even though a lot of people don't like me saying that. And so I wanted to give her just one more chance and make her rethink things because I knew how irrational she was sometimes. So I guess that was my mission and I did it, but yeah, it occupied a lot of my time. And I don't know, I think the relationship did a lot of damage to me in ways that I don't know. Probably socially or emotionally. And it made me question a lot of my own morals because I'm someone who says if you want to kill yourself you should. And yet, I'm someone-- or not that you should, but you should have-- and then sometimes I also think that for some people it's better for them if they did. Some people I think are born and they shouldn't have been born or they weren't-- it's not the right environment or it's not the right time. And yet, I acted in a way that contradicted a lot of my own beliefs.  And then I also questioned my own morals towards lying towards other people. Because there were times where we did a lot of sexual things and I faked enjoying it when I didn't enjoy any of it. So, yeah, that was draining. Because it was long distance, oftentimes-- basically, Freshman and Sophomore year I didn't hang out at all or do any after school activities because I just wanted to rush home from school so I can talk to her and make sure she's okay. That was my life for the first two years of high school. And then after I broke off the relationship, Junior year is-- all of a sudden, I started socializing a lot because I got-- through a classmate I got introduced to a lot of friends. So I was in a friend group for a long time and they basically were really close friends with me the entire year of Junior year until about the last month or two. Where there was some drama because I liked a girl in high school and a girl in the group liked me. And so the friend group didn't want me going after the girl outside the group, so they kept trying to sabotage my interactions with the other girl. And so it became very toxic so I left the group. I left the group, but to me, it seems stupid to do that because only some people in the group were being toxic to me. Half of them were perfectly okay people that I would still want to be friends with. And so I left for like a week, and then I tried to come back into the group just to hang out with those half of the people, just ignore the rest, but then they told me basically I couldn't come back. And so I lost all my friends then except for the girl I had a crush on. And then the girl I had a crush on got a boyfriend and so-- yeah, haven't really been hanging out with anyone. And that's basically [laughter]. it. Yeah."
1904.0,1916.0,Interviewer,A week is not a very long time for them to kick you out [laughter]. What do you think that was about?
1916.0,2027.0,Subject,"I mean, it was about more things than just that. The romantic aspect of it was the main thing, I think. Another thing was-- I mean, I'm a very-- I don't consider myself controversial, it's just I tell things the way they seem logically to me. And it seems that we live in a time where very few people have logic [laughter]. And so a lot of the group-- I don't know if it's politics or philosophy, they just have a different ideology than me. And so a lot of the things I said were probably decisive, divisive, I don't know. It just probably didn't sit well with them. And so when I was still friends with them and there was [inaudible] develop as a social friend. They could kind of brush my beliefs aside and just befriend the person that I am, but then I think as we got closer-- like as I got closer to friends, it's like we could start talking about more serious topics. It's like the foundation was already shaky. So when we started talking about more serious topics it's like we were on completely different pages and it was the groups’ ideology against mine. And so I think the romance thing was the thing that kind of triggered them to kick me out."
2027.0,2029.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] the straw that broke the camel's back.
2029.0,2033.0,Subject,Yeah.
2033.0,2047.0,Interviewer,What would you say is probably the most divisive thing that you thought that they didn't? Ideology-wise?
2047.0,2126.0,Subject,"Probably the suicide. The thing I mentioned about suicide. Or just the things I talked about. I mean, I was also very depressed at the time. Because Junior year is just-- that was straight after I broke off the fake relationship with that girl, so I wasn't in the best emotional state either. And there were a lot of times-- it wasn't just the topics I brought up. I acknowledged that maybe the way I talked and the things I talked about and the frequency that I brought them up, they weren't like things-- to me, they were things friends would talk about. But I think I had a misconception of what friends were there for and what type of people they were. And it didn't sit well with them, I think. It was disturbing to them. I'm almost scared that I traumatized them in some way with things that-- or that I've made them less pure. "
2126.0,2127.0,Interviewer,Less [laughter] pure?
2127.0,2161.0,Subject,"Like these are kinds of people that probably never thought or had to think that deeply about these kind of topics. Or they were never introduced to certain topics like self-harm. And I would just talk about it really casually. Because to me, it was a very casual thing. But that's just because-- I think compared to a lot of people I'm just really desensitized."
2161.0,2163.0,Interviewer,Desensitized?
2163.0,2234.0,Subject,"To violence. To certain emotions. Some people feel the-- some people don't feel depressed as frequently as me, and so when I talk about depressing things it's not a big part of their life, so when I bring it up it has a lot more impact on them. Or it's very new to them. Whereas, for me, it's whatever. Because it's every day for me, so. Either they weren't the right type of people for me or I genuinely wasn't good for anyone. Because in a way, I do feel like Junior year I wasn't good for anyone. Because I tried to make other friends after they left, but no one wanted to be friends with me either. So I'm like, ""There must be something wrong with me."" "
2234.0,2243.0,Interviewer,"I don't think that's fair, but what do you look for in a friend?"
2243.0,2284.0,Subject,"I don't really know. Because my perception of other people are-- it's really distorted at this point. Because almost all of Senior year, so far, I haven't interacted or been interacting with anyone, really. I've just been by myself. And honestly, I enjoy it. It's been a better year for me emotionally than Freshman, Sophomore, or Junior year."
2284.0,2288.0,Interviewer,And you think that's because you're spending more time alone?
2288.0,2292.0,Subject,Yeah.
2292.0,2297.0,Interviewer,Any particular way?
2297.0,2308.0,Subject,"Well, working out. Weightlifting mostly, and guitar, and reading. That's the majority of my time. "
