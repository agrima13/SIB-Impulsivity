1.0,5.0,Interviewer,I'm just going to start by asking you how things have been going for you lately.
5.0,76.0,Subject,"Things have been rocky. Since May I was hospitalized and I haven't been back to work. So that means the lack of those stressors, which is good because it was extremely stressful environment there. And it also means less structure for me in my day-to-day. And also no income, so that's kind of depressing. So it was good not having those stressors, but then it also brought on a lot of no insurance. So it's been a rollercoaster but I'm definitely in a better place than I was then in May. So I've been in and out of the hospital but still in a better, I feel, not necessarily-- more like a very slow-moving escalator going up. "
76.0,84.0,Interviewer,A slow escalator? What do you mean by that?
84.0,130.0,Subject,"So not necessarily a rollercoaster that have a lot of highs, but there is an upward that I'm trying to achieve and try to get to. Especially within the new-- I'm in CITPD right now and it's helping for my mental personality disorders, which is borderline independent. So I'm hoping that with-- this is the first time addressing those issues as well as the depression and anxiety, so I'm hoping it'll really be a good-- like I'm on the right track now to really be better."
130.0,132.0,Interviewer,That's wonderful.
132.0,133.0,Subject,Thank you.
133.0,135.0,Interviewer,So what is the program?
135.0,193.0,Subject,"It's CITPD. So we meet every single day except for the weekend. And it's got up to three parts. It's our core meetings, it's really group therapy. And then we have DBT. And then we have self and others when we were really working [inaudible] got into personal skills. So I've been there for two weeks so far. It seems to be going pretty good. It's a lot of crying for me but at least it's-- I'm used to being so numb all the time. So it's whether I'm numb and don't feel anything at all or I feel way too much and I end up in the hospital. So at least it's making me feel without the intensity of it, the after effect."
193.0,198.0,Interviewer,"So that numbness, what is that like?"
198.0,221.0,Subject,"It's always been weird because it's always been there. I've always been a kind of numb person that doesn't get extremely excited. Also that doesn't get really sad. I wouldn't cry at funerals or-- anytime I would ever cry is because I'm in physical pain, which I used to experience a lot in high school because--"
221.0,222.0,Interviewer,"Oh, why?"
222.0,290.0,Subject,"I used to suffer from migraines and I was diagnosed with endometriosis when I was in high school. So it's always been-- I was in pain for one thing or another all the time [laughter]. But otherwise, like emotionally-- everybody like, ""Oh, you're so strong."" And I'm just like, ""Okay. If you say so."" But I was in John J actually-- started in John J right after high school for forensic psychology, but that was the first time I had my really big meltdown. I was doing great. I was getting all As and Bs. I was actually upset for one class because I got a B minus. I was like, ""No."" But I was doing really well and I don't know, I guess everything that I was suppressing, not on my own will and consciousness, but all the things that was suppressed all just came back to me and it was horrible. "
290.0,293.0,Interviewer,So you were suppressing things?
293.0,327.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's what I feel like my numbness is. I'm not feeling motions as much as I should be. I feel like not grieving when I should, not enjoying the moment when I should, not-- they kind of just always just so-- a robot kind of feeling. So now, I'm learning to experience different emotions and kind of ride the wave and try not to go back into the hospital. The scariest place."
327.0,328.0,Interviewer,It's scary?
328.0,331.0,Subject,Yeah.
331.0,343.0,Interviewer,So what was it like when all of those things that you felt like you were suppressing came back?
343.0,381.0,Subject,"I don't know if I could even-- it was confusing mostly because I didn't understand what was going on. Those things happened months ago and I was finally in a good place in my life, so it was just like, ""Why am I feeling these things,"" when none of it was actually, currently, going on. So it was like my body had to get to this neutral place in order for me to feel, and when I felt it was way too much."
381.0,384.0,Interviewer,So you were remembering things that actually happened?
384.0,386.0,Subject,Right. Right.
386.0,388.0,Interviewer,And those were painful?
388.0,391.0,Subject,Right. Exactly.
391.0,480.0,Interviewer,"What kinds of things? Yeah, that sounds so unbelievably difficult. And to feel like the safe space that you had was invaded, that must have been really terrifying. Thank you for telling me those. I'm sure really hard. And I'm sorry that-- you said also afterwards the hospital was scary. Was it--?"
480.0,566.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't know. I feel like the way that mental ill patients are treated sometimes is not always in their best interest. Because sometimes I get-- it scares me. Like someone is screaming or they're having an episode and how they're kind of treated as they go all hostile. And it's understandable. You want to make sure that person is not a harm to the other patients, but it's they're here for a reason. They need that tender care in order to get through that episode and be okay. Not be treated like how the outside world treats them. They're in this place to get help, which is great. A lot of people that have mental illness don't even know because they don't even got to a doctor or seek help at all. And they need to seek other ways to cope in dangerous ways and ways of hurting themselves, hurting others. [inaudible] when you're in a hospital to get better you would hope that they would treat you like a human being. So it was just scary to see certain situations sometimes. "
566.0,575.0,Interviewer,So it was scary to see how they interacted with other people there. but was your experience in your treatment okay? I know it's terrifying to see other people.
575.0,601.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. For the most part, it was okay. I'm very much a person to just stay in my corner kind of [laughter]. I'm very much shy and people always say, ""Oh, you're so soft-spoken."" I just say, ""That's just how I was raised,"" so."
601.0,616.0,Interviewer,So you think you were raised that way. Do you think it was something deep within you? Like part of your personality or do you think that it was affected more by how you were raised?
616.0,677.0,Subject,"I think it was-- it's more how I was raised. Because I know with certain things like crying, or big expressions of happiness is kind of frowned upon in my family and it's really like, ""Gosh, okay. We get it. Calm down,"" kind of. So I feel like if it was part of my personality, it was something that was viewed as negative, so it was something that doesn't have a positive-- even crying. Even to this day, my grandmother, if she sees somebody crying on TV she'll be like, ""What are they crying for [laughter]?"" And it's just like, ""They're hurting [inaudible]."" It's a positive expression, but not really in my family [laughter]."
677.0,682.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I always find crying very therapeutic. "
682.0,687.0,Subject,Yeah. And it is. And it literally took me 27 years to realize that [laughter].
687.0,690.0,Interviewer,"No, I'm glad itâ€™s working for you. "
690.0,692.0,Subject,Thank you.
692.0,703.0,Interviewer,"That's really good. So before all of this happened you were doing really well in school, right? So forensic psychology, you said, yes?"
703.0,704.0,Subject,Yeah
704.0,708.0,Interviewer,So what inspired that?
708.0,771.0,Subject,"I fell in love with the Asian guy on SVU. He's a forensic psychologist. He comes in and out but he really just gives his expert opinion. And I actually love [inaudible]. I wanted to play his role, to be able to speak to not only the victims, but also to the actual accusers. Like is this person capable of doing what is claimed or-- I love that he had that power to really help them within themselves and not only just be like, ""Well, he was there. Take him away."" I hate the way the justice system is. It can be so black and white sometimes. So it was nice to have that person that just saw a human being. So I wanted to be that person within the justice system."
771.0,781.0,Interviewer,"That sounds amazing. And like you said, I think there's a lot of black and white in our justice system and- have you ever seen Criminal Minds?"
781.0,783.0,Subject,"Yes, I love that show."
783.0,795.0,Interviewer,It's just like that. They have all of these psychologists working together to try to figure out who-- I remember always wanting to be on the - what is it? - the Behavioral Analysis Unit [laughter] or something.
795.0,800.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yes, exactly. Yeah, they are profilers. "
800.0,802.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Oh, so that's-- is that different?"
802.0,833.0,Subject,"So it's different. But that would scare me because so many serial killers, and how-- I love that that show really shows are they able to have a lovely home, household, where they can have a spouse, have a family and come home to them, be safe, and how that really isn't real for them because of the people that they are working with. So it's like, ""Oh, my gosh."""
833.0,835.0,Interviewer,I know. It's pretty scary.
835.0,837.0,Subject,It is scary.
837.0,846.0,Interviewer,"So I have never seen SVU, the character you're talking about, SVU. Is his job-- doesn't sound less scary, is it?"
846.0,879.0,Subject,"To me, in my mind, it did because he can help so many people or just even just counsel people that are already in jail. Counsel so hopefully they won't ever return. [inaudible] their position. But it is dealing with possible criminals. But it's not only for sure they did something and we're looking for them. That's the only thing that makes it less scary for me [laughter], in my mind."
879.0,904.0,Interviewer,"Got you. And that's also really nice that it's like giving people kind of a second chance other than a judge and a jury. That's very cool. Okay, that's where you fell in love with forensic psychology. And how were those classes in college? Did you enjoy them?"
904.0,958.0,Subject,"I did. I definitely did. It was kind of crazy though because I-- when I registered for my classes so late, I had all senior classes for my first semester and they were all-- not to say all older crowd, so all the electives that nobody wanted to take-- I'm there with all these Juniors and Seniors and I'm just like this shy little Freshman [laughter]. But it was fun. It turned out to be a lot of fun and really interesting, but I don't know. I don't know what kind of happened with that first explosion. "
958.0,963.75,Interviewer,So you said you were a sexual health educator?
963.75,964.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
964.0,966.0,Interviewer,Was that during college?
966.0,1037.0,Subject,"No. I stopped after the first breakdown or whatever it's called, I stopped everything. I wasn't in school. I wasn't working. I was just home for a few years. And I was just extremely depressed. And it wasn't until about four years ago I was in school for medical information technology and trying to do something more towards what my mother used to do. And I got an internship at [inaudible] Health Center. And it was only supposed to be for experience, but a position opened for me and they hired me. And they were like, ""Oh, well, there's no point of really interviewing you. You've been here for months now. We kind of know how you work."" "
1037.0,1038.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Say [crosstalk].
1038.0,1109.0,Subject,"Well, yeah [laughter]. I got a job there and it was three years after that, a little under three years, so just two and a half years. I was actually promoted to be the sexual health educator. Because the manager at that position she was like, ""Oh, I see the way you work. I've been--"" it was funny because I was falling into a depression again and I realized that I was spiraling, and I was feeling really worthless, like no one saw me. I was working so much harder than everyone else and people made sure they were seen. You know how some people they do the tiniest little thing and it's just like, ""Yeah, I did that."" And I'm just not that type of person [laughter]. I would work so hard for the sake of our patients because I love that adolescents are so overlooked and get such a bad name and a bad rap for being adolescents, being teenagers. [inaudible] just yeah, the emotions are on high, but that's--"
1109.0,1110.0,Interviewer,It's not their fault.
1110.0,1133.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's just the chemicals. It's not like they were trying to be malicious or-- but it was really great working and I really loved the job. And I guess, at least, to that manager it showed so that's why she gave me that promotion. I was [inaudible] like--"
1133.0,1134.0,Interviewer,"Well, you deserved it."
1134.0,1135.0,Subject,Thank you. 
1135.0,1140.0,Interviewer,And so did that help with your feeling depressed at that time?
1140.0,1203.75,Subject,It didn't because I needed to do something from within to stop the depression. So anything external was just something new on my plate. It wasn't enough. And it was actually pretty hard because there was actually a person that was on the team already that didn't want me to be on the team. So she campaigned for me to not get hired before I was interviewed for months. For months and months before I was interviewed. And then made every second of-- once I actually still got the job she made my working there so difficult. It made learning the ropes so difficult. She'll give me bad information. She'll steal patients from me. The cow that broke the-- what is it?
1203.75,1204.0,Interviewer,The straw?
1204.0,1273.0,Subject,"Yeah, the straw that broke the camel's back, [laughter] yes, was when I was sitting with a patient and it was actually pretty hard because the-- I feel like the hardest is when the patients don't know that they're pregnant and they come in and they find out that they're pregnant and we have to go through the options with them. Like if they want to adopt, if they want to keep, or they want to abort. And she just ran into my room-- it was just like who's this,  asking my patient questions, and then just left. And I'm just like-- the actual - how you say - and there's a particular word for it, but the essence of the room was just completely tarnished after that because the patient no longer felt safe in my room. And that's the first thing you want to do. You want your patients to feel safe to talk to you and to really help them through this very hard time with them. So it was just--"
1273.0,1278.0,Interviewer,"Wow. God, what made her do that? That's so awful. "
1278.0,1280.0,Subject,No idea.
1280.0,1285.0,Interviewer,Did she know you before you started working there if she was campaigning against you?
1285.0,1295.0,Subject,We were actually cordial towards each other. We never had any blowout. We never had a fight. Never had any problems against each other.
1295.0,1320.0,Interviewer,"So bizarre. Some people are just really [laughter]-- I wonder what's going on with them. That's just so confusing. Okay. So you got promoted to doing this. That sounds really cool. It also sounds like a really hard job from what you've been describing. Did you find in rewarding, difficult?"
1320.0,1447.0,Subject,"Well, [laughter] it was definitely difficult, especially the manger that wanted to hire me, she really was like, ""Oh, I'm going to train you myself. Donâ€™t worry."" But once I got hired, her manager made her extremely busy and she was also very close to the person that didn't want me to be hired. So I don't know if I'm being extremely paranoid, but it was just like a way to make me fail. So it's like I had absolutely no support at all. So that made it extremely hard especially with her making sure that I didn't feel safe as well. But then it was so rewarding because with these patients that I've known for three years, I got to know them on such deeper levels. Got to know even more patients and really got to help them out with making-- helping someone with their autonomy was the biggest, biggest-- not to say-- it was on our job description, but that's really what we wanted. To make sure we're giving them all the facts and just helping them create the decision for themselves and what they feel is best for themselves. And knowing that just because they're a teenager doesn't mean that they can't make these decisions for themselves. It's just like, ""Yes, you've already made adult decisions. You have to continue. It's okay. Don't feel like the world is going to end because [inaudible] certain things that you didn't want to happen actually panned out. Don't go back in your mind and be like, 'Oh, my parents told me. This is it.'"" And it's like, ""No, it's okay. We just got to through the next steps."" It's [quite?] all right."
1447.0,1455.0,Interviewer,"That was actually really-- I'm sure you were really, really good at that job because that's such a beautiful way to put that. "
1455.0,1456.0,Subject,Thank you.
1456.0,1475.0,Interviewer,"You've already made adult decisions, so now you just keep going. That really takes the weight off from [inaudible] momentous aspect of that. So do you think that's something you would go back to-- if you could do anything, what's on the horizon?"
1475.0,1531.0,Subject,"No, I really don't know. Because I'm in a place that I have so much fear of going back into the hospital with going back into a deep depression. And I feel like there's so many moving parts that I don't know what really was the-- what made the puzzle come together. And I fear- should I just try something new altogether? Was it too much for me? Even if I am at a better place in my life, is going back into that job bringing me backwards? Will I ever be okay enough that I can go back into the job and be successful? I don't know. I have a lot of fear. "
1531.0,1557.0,Interviewer,"I don't know. But like you said, you're going up the escalator. I'm sure at some point it will get to the top. And it sounds like you're very talented at what you did chose to do, so I'm sure it'll continue that way. "
1557.0,1560.0,Subject,Thank you.
1560.0,1563.0,Interviewer,And so you're living-- but it seems like you have also a good support system. You're living with your mom?
1563.0,1564.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
1564.0,1565.0,Interviewer,How's that?
1565.0,1631.0,Subject,"Good. Especially with everything that I've gone through she has been so patient and I really, really appreciate her and seeing how grateful I am at having her too. So I'm really happy that we're in a good place. She's there supporting me. And I always feared being a burden to her, but the more that I open up to her the more that she doesn't make me feel like I'm a burden to her at all. So it was really a fear in my mind that wasn't realistic at all. And I'm glad that throughout these programs it made me test that fear, and really check the facts, and really see that it was just a fear that I made up in my mind and it's not true at all. And I can still receive that support from her and I really do appreciate it. Yeah."
1631.0,1640.75,Interviewer,That's great. So you think this program has helped you to conquer some of this fear? 
1640.75,1641.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
1641.0,1648.0,Interviewer,You said check it. That was the word you used. What do you mean by that?
1648.0,1723.0,Subject,"In part of DBT they have Check the Facts, and that's basically saying, ""Okay, separate what's emption and use what's called the Wise Mind to check the facts."" It's just so much of myself was holding what I'm feeling in that I wouldn't answer certain questions, or I would assume that she wouldn't do one thing or another, or that it'll be too much for her so I wouldn't even ask. And I'm dumping more and more and more on myself that I didn't give her the opportunity to be a support system like I needed. And now that I'm trying to find-- I know that I do need a support system. And now I'm trying to [inaudible] that opportunity to be like, ""You know, this is my mother. She does love me. I know if I ask she will be there. And if it's too much for her, we'll face it together."""
1723.0,1738.0,Interviewer,That's really nice. And it sounds like you two are pretty close to be able to have those conversations with each other which is great. Has it always been that way?
1738.0,1740.0,Subject,No.
1740.0,1742.0,Interviewer,No [laughter]?
1742.0,1767.0,Subject,"No, not at all. But especially when I was younger I kept a lot to myself that I do have to blame myself for that because I just-- I don't know. Sometimes I treat her like she's my baby and she is always like, ""I'm the mother here [laughter]."" And I'm just like, ""I know. I know. I have to remember that [laughter]."""
1767.0,1769.0,Interviewer,What do you mean treat her like a baby?
1769.0,1820.0,Subject,"She's a lot more emotional than I am and shows her emotions, so-- versus me being feeling comfortable in showing emotion, I would always be like, ""Oh, she's crying."" I'll let her cry on my shoulder, but when I'm crying I will go into a room and make sure she doesn't see. If she's sick and she's throwing up, I'm in the bathroom rubbing her back. If I'm throwing up, I close the door, run the water, make sure she doesn't hear me and just go to bed. Certain things that I just always didn't want to worry her with. So it became a thing that I was putting too much on myself, so."
1820.0,1824.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that was?
1824.0,1869.0,Subject,"I don't know. I guess, it kind of goes back to me not wanting to be a burden and fearing that I'll get pushed away. I have two should be father figures that were significant others of hers that are not father figures to me. And I always kind of just felt like nobody wants me or the only person that does want me is my mother and if I push her away then - sorry - then I wouldn't have anybody. Yeah, sorry."
1869.0,1877.0,Interviewer,"No, [inaudible]. You do have her. And it sounds like you always will and that's really beautiful."
1877.0,1879.0,Subject,Yeah.
1879.0,1880.0,Interviewer,I'm sorry.
1880.0,1881.75,Subject,It's okay.
1881.75,1882.0,Interviewer,Here.
1882.0,1884.0,Subject,Crying is therapeutic [laughter].
