0.0,7.0,Interviewer,So the first thing that I'm going to ask is just how things have been going for you lately?
7.0,56.0,Subject,"I've been feeling down and great paranoid in my own home, like I'm being watched or something. Sometimes I don’t feel safe in my own home. But recently, my psychiatrist made a change in my medications, so hopefully it gets better. I also feel uncomfortable right in the subway as well, so. But I still do it because I'm trying to get over it, force myself to get over it. But it's very uncomfortable [laughter]. Yeah."
56.0,59.0,Interviewer,What do you think makes it uncomfortable?
59.0,104.0,Subject,"The people. There's just so many people in the subway. I mean, not that I'm popular or well-known, but I just-- I don’t know. Sometimes I feel like they're looking at me, judging me. Yeah. I don’t know. I just don’t like the subway. And I wasn't always like that, actually. I used to always just be on the go to work and school or wherever else. I had no problem taking the subway. But as of lately, it's been bothering me, so. Yeah."
104.0,106.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] difficult.
106.0,109.0,Subject,Yeah.
109.0,114.0,Interviewer,
114.0,150.0,Subject,"My clothes, my body, my face expressions. Maybe they're looking to see if I'm a target for someone to rob or to harm, because all kind of people ride the subway, so. You just never know who you're sitting next to. You just don’t know, so. I think about all those things, really. I hate that I do, but I do, so."
150.0,151.0,Interviewer,And you hate that?
151.0,158.0,Subject,"Yeah, I hate it because I wasn't always like that. I'm sorry."
158.0,162.0,Interviewer,
162.0,166.0,Subject,I lived in New York all my life.
166.0,168.0,Interviewer,
168.0,169.0,Subject,
169.0,172.0,Interviewer,Don't be sorry. Here.
172.0,189.0,Subject,"I lived in New York all my life. And all of a sudden, I'm not comfortable doing what a New Yorker does. Ride a subway. It's crazy."
189.0,208.0,Interviewer,"It's not crazy. A lot of scary things happen on the subway, and it's not unreasonable to think that maybe something can happen to you. But I think you can also take some solace in the fact-- has anything ever happened?"
208.0,210.0,Subject,
210.0,216.75,Interviewer,"Right. So let's definitely hope that stays the same, right?"
216.75,217.0,Subject,Yeah.
217.0,231.0,Interviewer,It's been years and years and years. But those thoughts are really hard. It's not an easy thing to go through and it takes a lot of strength.
231.0,245.0,Subject,"Lately, they take over."
245.0,246.0,Interviewer,
246.0,276.0,Subject,"I get so uncomfortable. I'd have to talk myself in my mind to calm myself down. Sometimes I start shaking, and then next thing you know I'm like, ""Oh, can anyone tell that I look nervous? Can anyone tell that I'm a little uncomfortable?"" There's a whole bunch of thoughts in my-- it's too much sometimes."
276.0,283.0,Interviewer,
283.0,325.0,Subject,"I try to breathe in deeply. I try to breathe in deeply and I try to tell myself like, ""Come on, you've been here all your life. You used to be able to do this. This is nothing. You could do it. You could it. You just need to get to your destination. You can do this."" And sometimes it helps, and sometimes it doesn't. I just keep shaking. And then I don’t--"
325.0,327.0,Interviewer,
327.0,329.0,Subject,
329.0,332.0,Interviewer,
332.0,347.0,Subject,"I mean, I want to participate in this. I want to participate in this. I'm fighting it."
347.0,353.0,Interviewer,"And whatever you need to do for yourself, we will understand. There's no--"
353.0,362.0,Subject,I want to get over it. It's good that I have a reason to be out the house.
362.0,376.0,Interviewer,"We're going to do everything we can to make sure you can get over it. We've got you now. We know you. We know what you're going through, and we take that seriously. Okay?"
376.0,385.0,Subject,
385.0,391.0,Interviewer,
391.0,395.0,Subject,
395.0,396.0,Interviewer,
396.0,428.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, it's hard to go to every day. It's a Monday through Friday program and it's very intense, but I'm trying to get better, so I do it. I have difficulty getting out of bed every morning. Every morning."
428.0,431.0,Interviewer,How does it feel like?
431.0,439.75,Subject,
439.75,440.0,Interviewer,
440.0,488.0,Subject,"A lot of times, I just don't have energy and motivation. I just want to stay underneath the covers with my cat [laughter]. Sometimes it just feels too much to face the world. It just feels overwhelming. But again, I wasn't always like that. I really wasn't. I used to be in college. I used to be in college. I used to be working full time."
488.0,490.0,Interviewer,
490.0,520.0,Subject,"I was always on the go when I felt good about myself. I mean, college started to be tough after a while and overwhelming, and I had to stop. But at the time, I felt proud of myself that I was doing something with my life. And I had goals and I was working towards them. Now, just all a disability."
520.0,544.0,Interviewer,"I think you have a really big goal that you're working towards. Think about that. This is something that is really scary, and you are fighting it. You are doing so well. You're going somewhere every day. That is a huge goal, and you're accomplishing exactly what you want to do."
544.0,561.0,Subject,Yeah.
561.0,565.0,Interviewer,Where were you working before all of this started happening? You said you're working full time.
565.0,594.0,Subject,"I've been working in retail when I was about 15 years old. My last retail job was with Marimekko, a Finnish brand. It was full time. The pay was good. I ruined it."
594.0,595.0,Interviewer,
595.0,635.0,Subject,"Well, I got fired, which is for the first time in my life, because of my temper. According to my former manager, I had a temper and I'm a awesome worker and she loves having me there, but she cannot deal with my temper. So they let me go. I had lost a co-worker and a manager, so. Yeah."
635.0,638.0,Interviewer,
638.0,718.0,Subject,"I got really angry and I was yelling at both of them. And I was really behaving as if I was in the street arguing with a random person and ready to fight. That's how I was behaving in the workplace. I was not on medication. I was not in treatment. I was not on anything, and I would just snap. And unfortunately, I did. They even wouldn't hear my side of the story. All my manager said was, ""Melissa, did you yell?"" I said, ""Yes. But this is the reason why--"" ""Did you yell?"" ""Yes."" And that was it."
718.0,725.0,Interviewer,It doesn't seem fair. What is your side of the story?
725.0,894.0,Subject,"'m very focused when I work. And I was closing off a section of mine and the other young lady had another section of hers. And she was closing out the back of the store. I was closing out the front. We had a customer that shopped in the front of the store, which is the area I was responsible for, but she was attending to the customer and she sold pieces. And our job, we're supposed to replace pieces that we sell. And I'm closing out the front, and I'm noticing that there are pieces that are missing that she's supposed to replace. And I got upset because she didn't seem to want to do it. It's like she was leaving it up to me because it's my section. But as a salesperson, it's your responsibility to replace any items that you sell, because they put out a certain number of items on the sales floor, three pieces of each item. And back there, you know how to handle things well, so I had a attitude with her. And I was going upstairs to do what I needed to do in the stockroom, and I was kind of sarcastic with her like, ""Oh, don't worry. I'll replace the items that you sold,"" something like that I said. And it was pretty obvious that I was upset. And then it started like a back-and-forth thing, and then the manager got in. And I just felt like both of them were-- it was like them two against me. I mean, I wasn't wrong as far as what we're supposed to do, our responsibilities. I wasn't wrong. But my reaction at the time was really intense, and I yelled at both of them. And my body language, I'm pretty sure, was as if I was in the street or something. I was very unprofessional."
894.0,896.0,Interviewer,"wasn't doing her job very well, yeah."
896.0,898.0,Subject,
898.0,900.0,Interviewer,
900.0,931.0,Subject,"And it's frustrating. It was very frustrating. That happened back in 2015. So I had so many years to think about it [laughter] and realize, ""Yeah, she was wrong, but I didn’t have to behave the way I did."" Yeah."
931.0,933.0,Interviewer,
933.0,936.0,Subject,Yeah.
936.0,938.0,Interviewer,
938.0,971.0,Subject,"I did. It forced me to learn how to socialize and interact with people, because normally, I stayed by myself. So working retail taught me how to approach people, how to smile, how to try to keep conversations going, and things like that; because outside of it, that was not something that came easy for me. Yeah."
971.0,974.0,Interviewer,
974.0,982.0,Subject,
982.0,986.0,Interviewer,
986.0,999.0,Subject,"I always had a lot on my mind. I had anything you could think of. I have my home life. In school, I have my mom on my mind."
999.0,1000.0,Interviewer,
1000.0,1040.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. She was a paranoid schizophrenic, so. I would go to school and just think about my mom, is she going to be home when I go home. Or I'll think about the way she was behaving the night before, the strange things that she would say would replay in my head. That kind of a thing. Yeah."
1040.0,1042.0,Interviewer,Did it distract you from [crosstalk]?
1042.0,1057.0,Subject,"n't doing that, I was sleeping in class. Yeah."
1057.0,1059.0,Interviewer,
1059.0,1059.75,Subject,
1059.75,1060.0,Interviewer,
1060.0,1096.0,Subject,"'t really sleep at home. Well, I slept at home, but I wasn't really comfortable sleeping at home because my mom used to wander around the apartment at night. So sometimes I get a [inaudible] in walking in and out of our bedroom, where me and my sister slept, and seeing weird things, random things. Yeah."
1096.0,1098.0,Interviewer,
1098.0,1103.0,Subject,
1103.0,1105.75,Interviewer,
1105.75,1106.0,Subject,
1106.0,1107.0,Interviewer,
1107.0,1121.0,Subject,"I never really asked her. She doesn't have any mental health problems, so. I guess she is not affected. I don’t know."
1121.0,1122.0,Interviewer,
1122.0,1126.0,Subject,
1126.0,1131.0,Interviewer,
1131.0,1134.0,Subject,
1134.0,1138.0,Interviewer,
1138.0,1236.0,Subject,"Well, we were separated after a while in foster care. I mean, I'm well now or whatever, but growing up, I was in and out of the hospitals. I've been in and out of psych hospitals when I was 13 or 14. And I always had-- they thought I was bipolar. I always had these outbursts and I would get into it with my sister. And sometimes we'll go years without speaking. I used to feel like she didn’t care about anyone. I thought she didn’t love me. I felt like she didn’t care about what I was going through. And a lot of times, I would just act like I didn’t have a sister. But then after our mom died in 2016, that's when we finally-- well, with the help of our grandmother, that's when we finally became close."
1236.0,1238.0,Interviewer,
1238.0,1278.0,Subject,"She kept pushing it, forcing it [laughter]. She was like, ""Oh, both of you are sisters. You're all that you have. Same mother, same father. You should be best friends."" She would always say that, so. And she kind of forced it. And I think because we both lost our mom and we got older, a little bit more mature, I guess that's what made our relationship better."
1278.0,1281.0,Interviewer,So what kinds of things do you guys do together now?
1281.0,1305.0,Subject,"Well, we're not really in a good place financially, so we don’t really do much activities. We do talk on the phone every day, or text. We plan to do a spa day soon, so. "
1305.0,1306.0,Interviewer,
1306.0,1307.0,Subject,Yeah.
1307.0,1308.0,Interviewer,
1308.0,1324.0,Subject,"Well, she has been wanting to go since last year, and we've been talking about it. And this has not happened, so she got a coupon [laughter]. She said, ""We're doing this."" And I'm like, ""Okay. Yes [laughter]."""
1324.0,1328.0,Interviewer,
1328.0,1345.0,Subject,"I am, because I haven't socialized in a long time. I haven't even been out like that. Other than a hospital [laughter], I don’t really go anywhere anymore."
1345.0,1347.0,Interviewer,Do you think that outing will be great?
1347.0,1349.0,Subject,
1349.0,1353.0,Interviewer,
1353.0,1362.75,Subject,"Well, I think they have this Jacuzzi, so I want to go in there. And I heard there's an ice room."
1362.75,1363.0,Interviewer,
1363.0,1369.0,Subject,Yeah. I guess I'm supposed to feel good. I don’t know [laughter].
1369.0,1370.0,Interviewer,
1370.0,1385.0,Subject,"Yeah, right? And I wouldn't try the drinks. I'm not a drinker, but I still [will?] drink. My sister, she likes drinks, so I'll have one with her. So yeah."
1385.0,1386.0,Interviewer,Pretty nice way to relax.
1386.0,1390.0,Subject,
1390.0,1394.0,Interviewer,
1394.0,1436.0,Subject,
1436.0,1437.0,Interviewer,That's [impossible?] [laughter].
1437.0,1461.0,Subject,"Yeah [laughter]. Well, I mean, thanks for the incident. My phone, the social media, it's keeping me going, so. And then I talk on the phone sometimes with my sister, but not all the time. I mainly take a lot of naps and eat [laughter]."
1461.0,1463.0,Interviewer,
1463.0,1488.0,Subject,"I don’t cook [laughter], so I make sandwiches [laughter]. Yeah. Yeah. Nothing fancy. Sometimes, some pasta, but yeah. Because it's easy. Yeah."
1488.0,1505.0,Interviewer,And what do you think do you want to do moving forward? It seems like those programs are doing pretty well. You have some support. So what's on the horizon?
1505.0,1551.0,Subject,"Well, right now, I'm in the morning, the AM session. So after that, if they approve it, I move on to the PM, which will be every day [laughter] again. But I'm hoping by that time that I move on to PM that I'll land an internship or be able to assist wardrobe stylists, which is what I have been doing off and on. Fashion styling. I help them out on photo shoots, shopping for ad jobs and things like that."
1551.0,1554.0,Interviewer,
1554.0,1617.0,Subject,"Well, I did research and I went to the School of Style. They had some classes at Pier59 Studios. I did a nine-day intensive course. You pay for-- so they could send you emails on jobs and internships and things like that. So I would get emails from stylists that were looking for interns. It's not paying, but it's for experience and to build my resume, so. I'm off and on. I need a lot more experience, but I had to put it on the back burner and focus on my mental health. But hopefully, when I move on to the PM session, I can do more interning, so."
1617.0,1624.0,Interviewer,
1624.0,1657.0,Subject,"Working in retail for so many years, I realized that-- especially when I used to worked at the Gap, I enjoy helping customers pick outfits for certain occasions. I would have customers that would come in-- because I was there for so many years, after a while, there were customers that knew we. And they're like, ""Is Melissa here? Is Melissa here [laughter]?"" "
1657.0,1664.0,Interviewer,Right. I [inaudible].
1664.0,1711.0,Subject,"So if they have something that they're going to a party or whatever or get-together, whatever, I would enjoy putting outfits together. And I also would help out on the visual merchandising team overnights dressing the mannequins. And that's when I realized, ""I enjoy this,"" dressing the mannequins. I really enjoyed it, but I wanted to leave the women's department, so I went to visual merchandising, but the women's department did not want to give me out [laughter]."
1711.0,1715.0,Interviewer,Why would they? People were asking for you by name.
1715.0,1750.0,Subject,", because I wanted to be trained and I wanted to learn something going to something else. But I was only able to do the overnights for them, which was cool. I learned a little something, so."
1750.0,1755.0,Interviewer," whole process works, the dressing the mannequins [laughter]. I never see it. It's just [magic?] [crosstalk]."
1755.0,1836.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, for the Gap, they have a book that they follow. Because I think the people, the higher-ups and corporate or marketing team, they already put together looks. So they don’t really have-- how would you say-- they don’t really have creative freedom when it comes to dressing the mannequins at the Gap. But there are other retail stores where-- I think H&M, the employees, they can more get creative and do what they want. But at the Gap, we follow the book. And if we were sold out on an item, we'd have to replace them with something that kind of looks like the look that was in the binder. Carrying the mannequins up from the stockroom. They're heavy [laughter]. We have to put them together, dress the mannequins. It was fun. It was fun. Pinning down, making the clothes fit, and [inaudible] giving it a different look, making something appear more fitted or whatever. There are a lot of pinning. Yeah."
1836.0,1838.0,Interviewer,"Oh, so you have to really make it tight? [crosstalk] got that now."
1838.0,1861.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. And the mannequin sizes were zero [laughter], so. Yeah. And I used to take pictures of my work when I would put together the mannequins. Like I said, I realized it was something that I enjoyed."
1861.0,1865.0,Interviewer,
1865.0,1875.0,Subject,"I did after, yeah. I've been into running for stylist. I've actually been credited as an assistant stylist in magazines."
1875.0,1876.0,Interviewer,No.
1876.0,1877.0,Subject,Yeah [laughter].
1877.0,1879.0,Interviewer,
