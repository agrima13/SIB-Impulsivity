0.0,4.0,Interviewer,"Okay, so let me know a little bit about how things have been going on."
4.0,28.0,Subject,"Just with my life recently, so I just finished my first year at NYU in the Tisch drama program. I've wanted to go there since I was a kid. It was either that or Juilliard because my dad went to Juilliard. And I've known what I wanted to do with my life since I was like seven [laughter]. I think I've planned my entire life--"
28.0,29.0,Interviewer,Seven?
29.0,146.0,Subject,"--from that age. And I was like, ""Yeah, I want to be an actress, and I want to go to school, and I want to get a degree in drama from either--"" I think my top schools when I was a kid was NYU, Juilliard, or UCLA, because I'm from California. So I'm at NYU [laughter]. The first year was kind of a mess, though, just because my mental health took a really intense decline, and it made it really hard to function, and it made it really hard to actually get things done. Somehow, I passed all of my classes. Don't know how [laughter]. I still, I guess, got things done because I was more afraid of failing than anything else. Yeah. So I just had my last class yesterday. I have to write an essay this week [laughter].  Yeah, and then just interesting things about me, in general. I was a competitive horseback rider for a long time. And that was another career path. And I was like, ""Maybe I'll be a professional horseback rider,"" because I did show jumping, and I was really good at it. I was top of my division for basically the entire time that I did it. But it just got too expensive, and then I broke my arm. I broke my left humerus bone, which is a really weird place to break because you can't get a cast on it. So I just had to wear a sling for like two months, and then I was fine. Yeah. So I ended up quitting horseback riding. And then I moved into dance and cheerleading, and I did aerial, which is like Cirque du Soleil type stuff for a couple years. Yeah. But acting always stayed a constant, so I just kind of continued with that. And I continued to do theater through high school. And yeah, now I'm here. And I'm going home early on Sunday really early in the morning [laughter]."
146.0,147.0,Interviewer,So you're going home?
147.0,178.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm going to home to California for the summer, which is really nice. It's something that I think I really need because being here was crazy culture shock, and just my mental health was not taken care of at all. So I need to go home and actually get treatment and figure myself out before I can come back and be a productive member of society. As soon as anybody asks me to tell them things about myself, I forget everything about myself [laughter]."
178.0,184.0,Interviewer,So you said that you had a tough year about your mental health?
184.0,185.0,Subject,Yeah.
185.0,186.0,Interviewer,Can you tell me more about that?
186.0,802.0,Subject,"So my depression got really, really bad. I was skipping class all the time because I didn't want to get out of bed. I feel, I mean, I'm still like this. I feel hopeless every day, and I just wish I could-- I considered voluntary hospitalization just so that I could-- not even really because I was worried that I would hurt myself. It was mostly just so that I could have my life stop for a second so I could just sit in a hospital bed and do nothing and have a reason for it. But the main thing that I kept thinking about is like, ""I want to go to the hospital for a non-mental-health-related reason. I want to just end up injured somehow and then go to the hospital so I can relax for a little bit."" But I never ended up-- I knew that that was stupid, and I knew that I shouldn't pursue that. So I didn't. I just kind of kept going and kept kind of like dragging myself through. My anxiety hit an all-time high.  At this point, I feel like I can confidently say that I'm borderline paranoid. I consistently-- every time I leave a conversation, I think that the people or the person that I was talking to either hates me or is talking behind my back and saying things about me, talking about how annoying I am or how all I do is complain, and talking about how I'm a bad person and all these different things. And if that's something that for some reason I genuinely believe, even though rationally I know that that's not true, I feel like I'm divided into two different people. I'm a rational person, and then I'm an irrational person. There's the rational side of my brain because it's this strange dichotomy where when I'm having an anxiety attack or I'm feeling really, really depressed, or I'm in any sort of situation where my brain is telling me things that aren't necessarily true, I know that they're not true, but I still believe them and I still let that just consume me entirely. And so, yeah, my anxiety got really bad.  I think my anxiety and depression got to a point where at first semester, I got physically sick a lot when my immune system got really worn down. I've been having trouble sleeping. I haven't gone to bed before like 3:30 in the morning for the past two weeks, I think. And then it always ranges-- I don't think I've gone to bed before 12:30 or 1:00 and slept through the night for the past two and a half months, probably. I just can't. But the problem is I'll go to sleep really late, and then on Mondays and Wednesdays, my first class is at 3:30 PM, so I'll sleep until like 1:30 PM. And it's just like I'm still getting like eight, nine hours of sleep, but I'm pushing it back to a point that's not good for me.  And then all of this other dissociation and feeling like I'm not real, feeling like things around me aren't real, has started getting really bad. I've had sort of like little tiny glimpses of that, kind of throughout the past two years. When I was still living in California, I would kind of have-- but it would be small things, like I would be somewhere, and then my brain would register me somewhere else. I'd be driving down a street, and I'd be like, ""Oh, I recognize this place. I've seen this place before."" But I realize I don't recognize that place. I recognize that place as a place that's in another country that I've been to, if that makes sense. So I've driven down freeways in Los Angeles that I rationally know that I've never been on before, and I'll be like, ""I recognize this."" But then it will take me a little bit to realize that I am registering myself as somewhere in Canada, like a freeway in Canada that I've been in, if that makes sense. And that's been happening to me here a lot, actually. I register myself in Montreal a lot. And I'll be like, ""Oh, I recognize that. No, I don't. That's not the same building, not the same street.""  And then I've been having a lot of times where I just kind of like-- I feel like I-- it's hard to describe. It's almost like I leave my body where things around me aren't real. There aren't any consequences for my actions. I'll look at my hand, and my hand won't be my hand. It'll be like it doesn't feel like it's my hand, even though I'm the one that's moving it [laughter], and things will sort of drag. And yeah, that's been happening more. I've started noticing, actually, that I took note of this because I have a really, really, really bad memory. My memory has gotten exponentially worse in the past year. And so this is something that I keep forgetting to tell people about. But I've started noticing that some of my thoughts feel like they aren't my own. I noticed it. And so yeah, I noticed it a couple weeks ago where I was going to go to take my medication in the morning, and I just got this little ping in the back of my head that was like, ""Don't take the medication. The medication's bad for you."" And I don't believe that. I think medication is good for me. So that wasn't mine.  And then I'll get thoughts about things and about people that are more aggressive than I usually think. And I'll be like, ""Wait a second. Do I think that? Am I a bad person? Do I think that that person is ugly or bad or--?"" A lot of times, it's detrimental to people. A lot of times whenever I see homeless people, I think that they want to hurt me, and I think that they want to take things from me, even though rationally that's probably not true. They're just trying to live. But that's something that pops into my head every single time. I'm like, ""Nope, I need to cross the street or get away from this person because they're going to try to talk to me, and they're going to try to get my money, and they're going to try and hurt me in some way."" I feel that way with men a lot, too. But that's because I think that's partly because I've gotten catcalled a lot since I've been here, which is not something-- I've been catcalled before, but it's not as frequently as it is here because I live right next to a resource center that has a lot of people who just kind of like hang out on the street, and they will yell things at me. That happened to me on my way here. A guy passed me and he got really close to me, and he said like, ""You're looking really cute today"" as he passed by. And I was like, ""Ugh [laughter].""  Yeah, I have a blatant mistrust of people now. And I feel like everyone's lying to me all the time, and I feel like anytime anybody tells me something was good, or anytime my, well, I want to say boyfriend, but now it's ex-boyfriend, but not really. I went through a breakup. I broke up with my boyfriend. That's something that I should talk about. I broke up with my boyfriend a couple days ago because I felt like that was something that I was supposed to do. It wasn't even something that I really wanted to do, but people kept telling me that I needed to do it, and I felt like I was-- and people kept telling me that he was manipulating me. And I kind of felt like he was manipulating me. And I think partly he probably was. He has some control issues. But I kind of knew things weren't entirely healthy, but then people kept-- I would only ever tell people-- I would only ever complain to people, and so people would think that he was this awful person, and so people would tell me to break up with him. And people keep telling me not to get back together with him now. And I just didn't know what to think. My mom kept telling me to break up with him because she was like, ""Your life in--"" It's long-distance. He's in California. And she's like, ""Your life in California's dead. You need to move on, and you need to--"" And I just felt like so much pressure all over me, and I felt like I'm-- and it reached a point where I convinced myself that every time I told him I loved him, I didn't mean it. But I don't think that that's true. Yeah, I did it not because I wanted to, but because I felt like it was something that I had to do, and I just kind of freaked out and called him and was like, ""We need to end it. It's over. It's over. It's over. I'm sorry. It's over. I can't. I can't do it."" And people keep commending me for that decision, and I don't feel like it was the right decision.  We've been talking more. And so now we're in this weird, limbo space where we both want to be with each other, but we aren't. So we're going to talk about that over the summer. And that's been like-- my relationship was stressing me out because people kept telling me that I needed to end it. And I kept telling myself that I needed to end it, but I didn't really believe that. And I feel like that feeds into my paranoia, too, because anything he tells me, I think that he's lying to me. I constantly think that he's lying to me. And I don't really have any proof that he is. Actually, he probably isn't [laughter]. But I'm constantly thinking he's cheating on me, and he's lying to me, and he spoke to other girls, and he doesn't love me. There's no way that he loves me as much as I love him because I can't fathom anybody loving me, love that way because I am so horrifically unattractive to myself.  That's another thing that got really worse this year. My body image has gotten really, really bad. I think about that every single day. It affects everything that I do, how I look, how other people perceive me. I feel like I'm-- I feel like my body is grotesque and fat and just-- I have never seen another person with a body type similar to mine, but at the same time rationally, I know that I don't what my body looks like. I don't think I know [laughter]. I don't think I actually know what my body looks like, and I've been told that. Someone, I think either a therapist or a psychiatrist I had, told me I have body dysmorphia, which makes a lot of sense because what people tell me about my body does not match what I see, and yeah."
802.0,805.0,Interviewer,So you were saying that you're going home?
805.0,806.0,Subject,Yeah.
806.0,810.0,Interviewer,And can you tell me what you'll be doing during the summer?
810.0,980.0,Subject,"That's a good question. It's kind of up in the air. I applied for a lot of internships because I live fairly close to L.A., so I applied for a lot of internships in L.A. that are arts-based, that have things to do with producing and video and acting and things that I really like doing because I wanted to have something. I applied for paid internships because I wanted to have something-- because I need to make money over the summer, otherwise I won't be able to afford coming back. But I wanted to be able to do something that had to do with what I like doing, and I wanted to be able to have a set schedule because a lot of the internships, it's like a 9:00 to 5:00 either like three or five days a week. And I feel like that's something that I want more than random retail hours, but I haven't heard back from any of the internships.  I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do. If I don't do an internship, I'm probably going to go back to working at a makeup store. I worked at Ulta for a long time, so I'll probably go back to working there and just working at retail. I might work at a restaurant. And then I'm just going to try and spend a lot of time with my family and my dog and my friends, and I'm going to be in therapy a lot. I'm going to be seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist when I get back because the medication that I was on is not working. I accidentally stopped taking it for a couple weeks, so I'm off medication right now. However, I actually feel better than I did when I was on it. So I was taking Prozac, and it made me so numb and apathetic to everything. And I feel like I feel more things now that I'm not taking Prozac. I'm really bad at taking medication because my memory is so awful, and I have an irrational fear of my kitchen.  So I hate going into my kitchen because it smells like dead things. My sink is disgusting, and I hate-- it's just everything in it is grimy and has food all over it, and anytime I touch it, I feel like my hands are contaminated, and it feels slimy and disgusting and gross, and I hate having to wash things in it. My freezer smells like dead things. My fridge smells like dead things. The drain in our sink in the kitchen smells like dead things. And I'm pretty sure it's rotting food. Nobody else seems to have a problem with it that I know of, but I hate going in there. I hate going into my kitchen. But the only way that I can get water is if I get water from my kitchen sink, and I hate going into my kitchen so much that I never refill my water bottles. And so when I go to take my medication, I don't have any water, and I don't want to just dry-swallow the pills. So I'm like, ""Okay, I'll just do it later,"" and then I forget. So--"
980.0,981.0,Interviewer,So you're not taking medication right now?
981.0,1018.0,Subject,"Not right now [laughter]. I haven't been for a couple weeks. And that's a problem. But it's, yeah, it's mostly because of that. I hate going into my kitchen. I threw away one of my bowls because I didn't want to-- because I didn't want to go into my kitchen to wash it because the water is dirty and the sink is dirty and everything in it. There's always bowls and forks and spoons and things in the sink, and they're all disgusting. And everything in it is slimy. And I feel like everything, all of my things that have been in that sink, are contaminated, and I want to throw them away and get new ones."
1018.0,1019.0,Interviewer,So you live by yourself?
1019.0,1095.0,Subject,"No. I live with three other people in a dorm. And I think that's why it's so disgusting. I really don't like to-- actually, I don't like anyone that I live with, which is a bummer because I realize that I need a space to decompress at the end of the day, and I don't have that because as soon as I go in-- I share a room with someone. So there are two bedrooms, and there are two people in each bedroom. And I share a room with this girl. And every time I’m in my room, I can't relax because I feel like she's watching me and scrutinizing my every move. And I feel like she talks shit about me to her boyfriend on Skype. And I just feel like she's watching me and judging me all the time. And I don't like talking on the phone in my dorm because I know she's listening to me, and I know that she's judging me, and I hate being there. Everything about that space makes me so uncomfortable. And the floor is really dirty, and I get dust all over my feet all the time, but I don't have a broom. Our bathroom is disgusting, and I don't even want to touch anything in it because I have to clean it. Otherwise, we're going to get a fine because I'm moving out tomorrow, and so I have to clean it. I mean, we--"
1095.0,1096.0,Interviewer,You're moving out tomorrow?
1096.0,1112.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm going to stay-- so I'm moving out of my dorm tomorrow, but I'm not leaving until the 19th. So I'm going to stay with a friend for a couple days, and then I'm going to the Hamptons for two days to see my godfather."
1112.0,1113.0,Interviewer,"Oh, your godfather."
1113.0,1276.0,Subject,"Yeah, which is really nice. He was my dad's childhood friend, and he lives in Boston, but he has a house in the Hamptons because he is a hedge-fund guy. And so I'm going out to see him and his family. He has four kids and a wife, and they're great. Yeah. He's known me since before I was born. I was a flower girl at his wedding. And my mom and him and anybody who was there will make fun of me for this forever, not make fun of me, but they'll mention this every time it comes up. When I was a flower girl, I was like four or five. I had a little basket with rose petals. And I just threw them down on the ground. I wasn't tossing them. I was slamming them onto the ground [laughter]. I was the most aggressive flower girl. And they always joke about it [laughter]. I don't know why I was like that. I was just really enthusiastic about my job. I was throwing them. Yeah. And I vaguely remember that happening, but at the same time, sometimes I don't know-- if I remember things that are too far back, I don't know if they're real or not.  I know and I-- that's another thing. I don't know if the things that I think or the things that I do are normal or not because I feel like they're abnormal. But my entire life, my mom has told me that everything that I'm feeling is entirely normal and everybody feels this way. And so now, I don't know what's normal and what's not. So I don't know what I should tell people and what I shouldn't because I don't know-- yeah, I don't know what's normal and what's not. So I don't know. Something that I think is abnormal might not be abnormal to somebody else, or somebody that I think is totally normal is not normal to somebody else.  I told a friend of mine that I see static behind everything. And I was like, ""Yeah. It's just something that people see."" And she was like, ""I don't have that [laughter]. I don't see static behind anything."" And I was like, ""Oh. Okay."" Yeah. The last time we talked, we talked about auras around, like light around things. I've been noticing that. Sometimes things will have light outlining it. But in a way, that's like when you stare at the sun for a little bit too long, or you stare at a light and then you look back at it. But I won't have stared at a light. It'll just be that way. It happens a lost when I'm in fluorescent lights. It's happening right now. There's light that's kind of emulating around the walls. Yeah. It's constantly moving."
1276.0,1279.0,Interviewer,So you were telling me about when you were a child and your memories.
1279.0,1479.0,Subject,"Yeah. So when I remember things from my childhood, I remember them in flashes, like glimpses. I don't really remember full days or full scenes or conversations that I have with anybody. I might remember small bits of conversation. But sometimes if I remember too far back, I won't be able to tell if it was real or not. And then I'll just kind of go down this rabbit hole of like, ""Well, how do I know that it was real? How do I know that it wasn't real? How do I know that I actually experienced that?"" And then I'll just kind of-- and then I'll feel like I'm there again all of a sudden, if that makes sense. It'll be like, ""Oh, I'm re-experiencing this."" And then I'm, ""And so it had to have been real."" And then I'm like, ""Wait a second. I'm almost 20. I'm not 7 years old. I'm not re-experiencing this [laughter].""  There's one memory in particular that I have had since I was young, and I've never been able to tell if it was real or not. And I haven't really asked anybody about it because the faces in it are obscured. And my mom wasn't there, so I can't ask my mom because she wasn't there. But it's like it's really vivid, but in a weird way. It's almost like I'm watching a VHS tape in my head or like eight-millimeter film where it's that kind of like that sort of film style, but it's a memory and it's-- yeah. I'm at someone's house. I don't know whose house I'm at. I'm with a couple of my cousins. I don't remember which ones I'm with. There's a kiddie pool in the backyard. The grass is green but also kind of dead. The kiddie pool is pink. There's a hose in the kiddie pool. And then somebody brings me inside. I'm with some adult. Some adult is watching me. I'm a child at this point. And they bring me inside and they show me this old video. And my grandparents are in it, and they're at some event. I don't know what event it was, but they were like, ""That's your grandparents. That's your grandparents."" And I was like, ""Okay. I know."" But my mom doesn't have any memory of leaving me with anybody. But also, it was so long ago. I don't know. I used to just kind of get passed around in Montreal. If my mom was going somewhere with my grandfather - she would kind of go to events with him sometimes - somebody would care for me, obviously. So I've had that memory for years, and I've never been able to figure out if it's real or not. And sometimes I forget about it and then other times I'll just kind of remember it. I'll be like, ""Oh, weird."" And I didn't use to. That used to be the only one that I wasn't able to tell if it was real or not, but as I've gotten older, more and more memories in the past have gotten more obscured, and I'm like, ""I don't know. Did that happen?""  And then there will be some things that I rationally, definitely know happened, but I'll still be like, ""Hmm, did it [laughter]?"" I'll convince myself that it didn't, even though it definitely did, and then that's the rabbit hole that I go down to. I'm like, ""I know this happened, but what if it didn't? What if I'm making it up? I don't know."" These are just things that I think about [laughter]."
1479.0,1485.0,Interviewer,"And what about like you were mentioning about production and filming, about your future, something?"
1485.0,1577.0,Subject,"Yeah. I want to go into the film industry, for sure. I want to do film acting. I'm getting a minor in producing on top of my degree. We'll see how that goes because I have to take extra classes for that. Yeah. I'm getting a minor in producing, and for the minor, I actually have to get an internship. So I was hoping that I could just knock it out this summer, get the internship that's related to arts and still be doing something that I like doing. If I got an internship like that, my summer would be like what I want it to be, like what I envisioned it to be. And if I don't, it'll throw everything off kilter, and it'll be a mess. But yeah, I want to go into the film industry. I kind of just want to have my hands in everything. I want to learn how to produce film. I want to learn how to direct film. I want to learn how to act in film, which is why I'm in a drama program [laughter]. And I want to-- I kind of want to learn how to write. I'm not entirely sure. I don't love my writing right now, but that could change. I don't know. I just kind of want to do everything.  And I want to go into theater, as well. So I might stay in New York after I graduate. I haven't really decided about that yet. I'm graduating a year early, so I'll be graduating in 2021. And so I might stay after that. I don't really know. And I don't know what I want to-- I don't know. I know long-term what I want to do, but a little bit shorter-term within the next three years, I have no idea. I don't know."
1577.0,1579.0,Interviewer,"So long-term, you know where you--"
1579.0,1634.0,Subject,"Long-term, I know what I want to do. Long-term, I want to end up in film acting. I want to win an Oscar, and I want to get rich [laughter]. Don't we all [laughter]? Yeah. That's been the goal since I was like seven. That's the end goal of like, ""I'm going to be a famous actress, and I don't think I can accept anything below that."" And I'm hoping that happens by the time I'm in my 30s, but who knows? Yeah. I don't know. And then after I've reached that goal where I'm famous and I'm getting movie deals and I'm doing all of these things, that's about where I've planned to. And then I'll take it from there because that's when everything will be perfect and good, and I'll have money, and I'll have what I wanted, and I'll be able to just chill and let things come at me as they do. But until then, I have to get there [laughter]."
1634.0,1637.75,Interviewer,Okay. And you said you knew since you were seven?
1637.75,1637.85,Subject,Seven.
1637.85,1638.0,Interviewer,Exactly seven?
1638.0,1665.0,Subject,"Um, I'm pretty sure. Around seven. That's like third grade, I think. It was probably seven or eight. But yeah, ever since I was a little kid, people would always-- in elementary school, we would always have to do like, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" And every single time, my answer was the same. Every single time, I was like, ""I'm going to go to Juilliard and I'm going to be an actor, and I'm going to do this, this, and this."""
1665.0,1668.0,Interviewer,"And besides your career, any other dreams or--?"
1668.0,1798.0,Subject,"I mean, I want to get married. That would be cool. I don't really want kids. That idea terrifies me of raising a human that will eventually become my age now and will be a productive member of society, another creature that has coherent, real thoughts that I will have to converse with and teach things. Freaks me out. I don't like it. Yeah. I've never wanted kids. Yeah. For as long as I can remember, I've never wanted kids. The only thing, the only situation in which I could see myself having kids, is if I have kids with this guy who's my half ex because we're just in a weird-- we're on like a break right now is really what it is. He's the only person that I've ever been able to envision myself having children with, but he's also the only person I've ever been able to envision myself having sex with because for a really long time, sex terrified me.  I've had a really complicated relationship with sex, and I'm not entirely sure why, yeah, up until-- and even then, I still have a really complicated relationship with sex. I can just fathom having sex with him despite the fact that I have kind of had sex with two other people, but that was during a really-- both of those times were very impulsive. Oh, wait, three other people. Those three other times were very impulsive and bad decisions, probably, because I just didn't think about the consequences. I was like, ""Yeah, okay."" I just kind of went along, and not just went along, but I just impulsively was like, ""Okay."" And yeah, I still have a really complicated relationship with that.  But the idea of having kids freaks me out just because it's like that's a real human that I am responsible for. I can barely be responsible for a dog [laughter]."
1798.0,1799.0,Interviewer,You like pets?
1799.0,1945.0,Subject,"Yes. I've always had pets. And I've realized that that's something that I really need. I have never been without an animal until this year. I did not realize how much I relied on having a creature to love because ever since I was a baby, since before I was born, actually, I've always had at least one dog. At one point, I had two dogs, three cats, a hamster, and a horse [laughter]. That Christmas card was really funny because my grandma used to like to photoshop things, and so she would make all of our Christmas cards. And so she made this Christmas tree, and everybody was an ornament. And it was me-- the only humans on this Christmas tree were me, my grandmother, and my mom [laughter]. And everyone else were animals, and it was so funny because they just vastly outnumbered us [laughter].  Yeah. So I've always been with animals. I love animals. And I'm really sad that I can't have one here because I live in a dorm. And I could probably petition to get an emotional-support animal. And I wanted to get a cat, but one of my suite mates next year is severely allergic to cats, so I can't get a cat. I could petition to get an emotional-support dog, but then I would have to take care of the dog and take the dog home with me. And I already have a dog in California. And I don't think my parents would love that very much, so I just have to kind of suffer until I inevitably get-- if I stay, until I get-- I think I'm going to get an apartment in my third year. I'm living in a dorm next year, and then I'm going to get an apartment in my third year, and then I'll probably get a cat or a dog or something like that.  There's a very specific cat breed that I want, but they're expensive. I really want an Oriental Shorthair. They're so cute. They have really long legs [laughter], and their faces are kind of like-- their faces are interesting. They're not like regular cats. They have kind of like not domed, but they have really interesting faces. They're really cute. And I'm fixating on them right now. And their ears are huge. They look like little bats [laughter]. Yeah, I'm fixating on that specific cat breed right now. I need one of those, and that's the only cat that I want despite the fact that they're $1,000 [laughter]."
