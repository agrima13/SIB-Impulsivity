1.0,6.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So the first thing I just want to ask you is, how things are going for you lately?"
6.0,106.0,Subject,"So actually, I've been recently asked to be a godfather to my niece of two months now. So that actually made me really happy, when my sister took me out with her husband and they asked me the question over lunch, of course. And at first, I asked them are they sure, considering I'm not particularly well trained with kids and I'm also relatively young, considering I haven't even started on the path to my career. And they're like, ""Yeah, because we want her to have someone of equal or close age proximity."" So when she's 19, I'll be 38 or something. So I can probably relate to her more. And I guess, they see me as a more modern-- I'm a Millennial, so they assume that I will keep up with the times. I probably won't [laughter]. Courses for summer, that's currently at Hunter, stats, so [inaudible] stats, intro to art, merely just for to get at the core elements, and fall semester, I will be starting my bio track. So anything science-related, I will just tackle head-on and just try to breeze through it. Lots of questions about what I'm going to do and what I have done so far. I've done little so far, which I'm pretty disappointed about myself. "
106.0,107.0,Interviewer,Disappointed?
107.0,134.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm pretty disappointed about myself on that because I feel like I could have done so much more if I had stopped quitting on certain things. I've started running again because I want to join track this upcoming year. And then the following year, I want to join soccer. So it'd be good to be able to last longer than a minute on the field [laughter], than what I'm able to currently do. "
134.0,136.0,Interviewer,"Well, that sounds like a lot's going on for you."
136.0,139.0,Subject,Yeah. I have a lot on my plate at the moment.
139.0,144.0,Interviewer,So tell me more about track and how that will help you?
144.0,177.0,Subject,"I took track in high school. So it actually helped me release some tension I had. It wasn't just running. I also did a few-- we also fooled around, obviously. We'd train on Muay Thai because our coach was a Muay Thai master, apparently, and he just showed us a bit of how to kick with extreme force. And it just hurt a lot because I was the punching bag [laughter]. I wasn't the punching bag. I held the punching bag but the force nearly knocked me out. "
177.0,178.0,Interviewer,Knocked you out?
178.0,230.0,Subject,"Out of wind, out of breath. I guess he'd be fired if he actually did something like that. I wouldn't tell on him either because we're very close friends. Track. Oh, it helped me academically besides music and other study-related courses. I just needed a change of pace and change of environment. And track took me to all these places like Stony Brook, other campuses, to see what I want to do for college. And I decided to stay in the city because it's just much more convenient. It's 20 minutes away from where I live, though today it was kind of hectic so it kind of took me a little while to get here. Did you have any more questions?"
230.0,232.0,Interviewer,So you're at Hunter?
232.0,233.0,Subject,I'm at Hunter currently.
233.0,235.0,Interviewer,Do you like it there?
235.0,236.0,Subject,No [laughter].
236.0,237.0,Interviewer,No? Interesting.
237.0,283.0,Subject,"I feel like I should have left-- I should have gone to John Hopkins or somewhere else because though the tuition would have been completely unreasonable for an undergrad, I feel like it would have been a better experience. Maybe one year and then transfer out. But I know dental school is going to be a hell lot expensive. And I don't want to be in debt just yet. Maybe give it a year or two and see where that goes. But Hunter, currently, it's-- most of my class that graduated last year, they came to Hunter with me. So it feels like I never left high school. Though I barely see them, I do talk to them, do hang out with them of sorts. Hunter's curriculum and teachers are terrible."
283.0,284.0,Interviewer,Really?
284.0,317.0,Subject,"Terrible. I forgot to do Rate My Professor. I should have done that before I even-- because it's just the language barrier and some of them have very heavy accents which I can't pick up on certain words that are important to the subject. And they don't really bother to stick to the textbook, just rattle on throughout the entire lecture. So yeah, I had to wait till this year to start my bio and I have to check it all with my professor stuff besides that."
317.0,324.0,Interviewer,And what got you to start doing biology?
324.0,367.0,Subject,"Well, I guess, my sister. I have three. I have older brother. My sisters are all high achievers, always been high achievers, straight-A students, top of the class, honors. I'm, frankly, average, I guess you could put it that way. Though, I'm supposing my writing is good. And I love science mainly because-- or merely bio, the human anatomy, because my sister, she's on pre-med track. She's trying to get into medical school. Currently, she's a scribe at Mt. Sinai right here. That won't be in the thing, right?"
367.0,368.0,Interviewer,No [laughter]. 
368.0,457.0,Subject,"Okay. All right. Not that it matters. There's so many scribes, but just in case. She may [get mad about that?]. There was an open textbook of the human body because I had-- I think I scraped my knee at one point. I was just curious why it started healing so quickly. And so I saw the textbook, I saw a knee, I saw a leg, and I saw how it was similar to mine. And I was just curious, I'm looking at it. I kept on flipping through the papers and the pages, and I saw the brain and I saw the arms and legs. I saw muscle tissue and all the interesting things about the cells. Not interesting as it is right now for me. But I found that pretty cool. And she was telling me how, ""Oh, you might want to be a doctor."" I said, ""No [laughter]. That'll be your job."" She can see the doctor. Because the way I thought of it now, is that because all my siblings are in different careers, if you ever need something, we just ask the other sibling. So I want to be a dentist because in case they need braces for their kids, I won't make it hurt as much, but also be considered the evil uncle [laughter]. They won't be seen as the bad parent. They are all in technology and medical field. And if I need anything help with that, I definitely contact them for that."
457.0,458.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
458.0,459.0,Subject,Yeah. Basically.
459.0,464.0,Interviewer,"And so do you want to be a dentist, orthodontist?"
464.0,524.0,Subject,"I was thinking orthodontist. But surgeon seems pretty cool. I'm curious to see if my hands will start shaking by then, but we'll see in 20-- not 20. 6 years, hopefully. Maybe surgeon because I find the idea of dislocating a jaw and snapping it back together or how to take out teeth and replace them, it's all the fine tissue, fine nerve endings, and that'd be pretty cool to study. But general orthodontist, I guess you would say, would be cool because I like kids. Just they're 30 minutes there and then they're gone. This is great. It's great for me. So I get my fill and then they can leave. That's basically the reason why. Also the pay I really good [laughter]. Yeah."
524.0,526.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you like kids?
526.0,527.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.
527.0,533.0,Interviewer,Nice. So seems like your sister knew that when she asked you to be--
533.0,573.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I basically took care of also my niece and nephew when they were born. So I got pretty close to them. And when my other niece was born-- she was unexpected, so it was kind of funny. Yeah, it's kind of funny, I saw that as an opportunity to spoil her as well. I mean, her grandparents just love them so much. My parents just love them so much. Grandparents, in general, just spoil them regardless of what happens, what they do. They could be the worst rotten kids ever, they'll still spoil them, get them whatever they want. I don't think I want to be that way [laughter]."
573.0,580.0,Interviewer,So what does being a godfather mean to you?
580.0,656.0,Subject,"I mean, I'm not particularly close to my own godparents, mainly because my godmother passed away a couple of years back. And I'm not really close to my own godfather, though I should be. Because I'm starting to realize now, family is really important. Support and confidence in one another, confidentiality in one another, it's pretty good for one's mental health. And I've started to try to associate with my parents a little more. Because frankly, they're quite old. My dad's close to 70 and my mom's past 60 [laughter]. So I'm trying to see if I could connect with my godfather again and my god-sisters and their kids, which I am. I'm talking to them a bit more, but it's hard to receive a connection when it feels like that connection was severed off long ago and they're almost like strangers to me. And I wouldn't want to be the same way to my goddaughter who-- I'm not the godfather as yet. It's in August, but I'm already deciding on what-- yeah. I'm already preparing to do what I have to do to provide for everything. "
656.0,665.0,Interviewer,Why do you think it feels like the relationship with your godfather has been severed?
665.0,728.0,Subject,"We live, frankly, right next to each other, just down the street. He is much more religious than I am. He is a deacon at our local church. And he is easy to talk to, it's just he also, I wouldn't say forces down religion your throat, but he's always shifting the conversation of, ""Hey, how are you doing at school?"" to, ""This is what God needs you to do to do better."" And though I am trying to find God, it's hard because my parents also are very religious, they're forcing me-- I grew up with the mentality that religion is everything. And it should be. I feel like now it should be. But I feel like every time I look at my godfather, I feel disappointed with myself because I couldn't find that connection to God the way they see it. Okay. I can't relate to them in that aspect. "
728.0,736.0,Interviewer,That's so interesting. So you said that you think it should be. Why do you think that?
736.0,817.0,Subject,"As I said, I am trying to find God but it's-- I find it won't cut it out this year. It was more of, I told her about my theory of the single-being theory, that basically if everything is part of your reality, so to me, you're just another part of my reality to see, that if I died, everything around me would be gone. Because to me, there'd be no evidence of life continuing on from my perspective. But then, religion says that, no, life goes on to your kids and everything else has a purpose. Which is what I want to believe. I want to believe I'm here for a purpose. I'm here for a reason. Maybe down the line, my reason will be shown to me. But as of right now, I'm just frankly quite lost. But I'm still kind of leaning towards the theory as well. So I don't know, it sounds very self-centered. I try not to think of it that way too much. More of why I shouldn't-- I feel like the theory also holds me back a bit, kind of puts me on the mentality that I shouldn't give my 100% because what's the point? But yeah, I feel like religion would help with that a bit."
817.0,821.0,Interviewer,"So that's a really interesting theory that you have, though. Was that your [inaudible]?"
821.0,825.0,Subject,"No, no. I read it. I read a lot of articles. It's science-based."
825.0,833.0,Interviewer,Interesting. And where did you come across that?
833.0,894.0,Subject,"I actually searched it up. I was searching up an article on God, religion, where it came from. Because humans weren't around forever, they're at one point created. Though I don't like to believe that we came from monkeys, it's possible. Anyway, we do share half a DNA with the banana, so it's up to interpretation. So I guess, science-based article-- I don't remember. It was long ago that that idea was put into my head. And I can't seem to shake it off. I stumbled across it because it was-- where there is one point, there is another person's perspective. So there's always two articles contradicting one another. And I clicked on both, just to see what would happen. And it changed how I feel and how I think from there on."
894.0,899.0,Interviewer,Interesting. And do you read articles like that a lot?
899.0,949.0,Subject,"I try to now because I feel like my reading and my writing has gone down the drain. Though I've started picking up a few novels. I like to learn big words [laughter] because in high school I had a friend who was always talking in big words and no one ever would say, ""Shut up,"" because no one would understand what the hell he's saying [laughter]. But he was like, ""Oh, you guys are just plebeians."" I know what that means. You're an asshole. But he kind of forced me to pick up a dictionary, pick up a book, learn a few things. I feel like that also helped me now as I get better at writing. Research paper in the future is going to be a big thing."
949.0,950.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you're interested in research?"
950.0,965.0,Subject,"Yeah. I have to do research eventually, which is why I prepare myself now so it won't be as hard down the road. But yeah, lab reports, all that stuff, is going to be in my future."
965.0,971.0,Interviewer,And what kind of novels are you reading?
971.0,1137.0,Subject,"I was reading the Bible [laughter]. But that's a lot of books. That's a lot of stories in one-- that's a lot of stories in one book. And my mom's always like, ""Eh, instead of watching funny videos of, I don't know, lost animals reuniting with their owners, [inaudible] I ever found, why don't you pick up the Bible?"" So I did. I picked up the Bible. Put it back down [laughter] after half an hour, an hour. Sometimes I just flip through the book to see, maybe there's a message for me? Maybe by some miracle or possibility of an outside force, it might put me on the correct path to show me you shouldn't kill. I mean, obviously, you shouldn't kill. But so I started picking up H.P. Lovecraft because, apparently, he's a pretty good writer, Edgar Allen Poe. I'm trying to do some classic books before I diverge into a different genre. I like the Cthulhu. I started reading the Cthulhu, and there's a lot of old English. So I have to look up words and I'm like, ""I don't know what that means."" Because it's a lot of-- it makes you think that he dropped acid at one point [laughter]. Because a lot of it sounds unreal to someone who wouldn't be under the influence. So I like that about reading on this being that comes and kills people and takes them away and just changes their minds and warps their memories. I'm like, ""Okay. If I could write something like this, I feel like I-- I wonder how I would trip if I ever did that [laughter]."" I read a few detective suspense thrillers. It was called Abandoned by [Conrad Fadden?]. It's actually a pretty good book besides all the drugs, rape, and the suicide. I read that when I was 15, so I didn't know what was going on. I picked it up again a year later, and I was like, ""Oh, this is pretty good [laughter]."" Not to the antagonist, obviously, but it was pretty interesting to reread and see how far my knowledge has come forth, so I can actually understand it. I can actually comprehend certain things. I go back and watch few movies. And I think Scar from the Lion King did nothing wrong. He was doing everything for the right reasons. But yeah."
1137.0,1138.0,Interviewer,Interesting. Why do you say that?
1138.0,1169.0,Subject,"Because he just wanted some of the jungle to prosper. If that means taking over everything else, then yeah, go for it. The Ottoman Empire wasn't-- even though it was small at first but it took over everything and it kind of prospered at one point. It just kind of screwed themselves over, over the whole military and you-don't-think-people-are-going-to-fight-back type of rule. "
1169.0,1170.0,Interviewer,"You know history, clearly."
1170.0,1172.0,Subject,A little bit. Very little. I hated history.
1172.0,1173.0,Interviewer,Really?
1173.0,1201.0,Subject,"I was forced to-- I was forced to take that course because my history teacher was like, ""Hey, I can write you a rec letter if you take my course."" He needed one more person to be in his class in order to fulfill the course requirements. So I was like, ""Sure, why not."" But really, I got out there with a B. I was so mad. I wasn't bright when I was back in high school. The first year, I was, I guess you can say, a C student."
1201.0,1202.0,Interviewer,B is not bad.
1202.0,1259.0,Subject,"B is terrible [laughter], according to my family. It's terrible. Got to take organic [inaudible], that's going to be a trip. From there, I was kept reminded of my parent's mortality. They're like, ""We're not going to be there forever. Better start taking things seriously."" So I did. A minus was all right too. But I started thinking, grades do matter [laughter]. They do. They really do. So I started researching schools that would take my credits. So basically, I transferred to Hunter. I just need two more years to fully graduate. So then I'll be-- I could actually brag to my siblings that, ""Oh, I got into medical school before you guys did [laughter]."" But it's down the road. I don't really know much about that."
1259.0,1263.0,Interviewer,You're going to be done in three years then total?
1263.0,1265.0,Subject,Two. Two more years.
1265.0,1266.0,Interviewer,"But I mean, total, it'll be three?"
1266.0,1267.0,Subject,Yeah. Two. Yeah.
1267.0,1268.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1268.0,1292.0,Subject,"So that helped a bit, progressing. I think they have more-- because it's an early-college type of deal, so I think they are opening more campuses across the United States. Then they'll probably open one in Beijing. But it would be really cool to visit. Hope they open one in Singapore because it's a beautiful place."
1292.0,1293.0,Interviewer,Have you been?
1293.0,1327.0,Subject,"No [laughter]. There aren't many places I want to be, but Singapore is mainly known for the rich and the wealthy of the Asian population. My coach, he's from Singapore, from high school. So he showed me all these pictures he took of beaches with pink sand and it just looks amazing, I think. It'd be really nice to surf, I guess. I don't know how to surf. But it would be nice to swim or learn how to swim."
1327.0,1328.0,Interviewer,You don't know how to swim?
1328.0,1329.0,Subject,I don't know how to swim [laughter].
1329.0,1330.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1330.0,1333.0,Subject,Yeah. It's long overdue. 
1333.0,1337.0,Interviewer,"I guess, if you grew up in New York, maybe you wouldn't have [inaudible]."
1337.0,1342.0,Subject,"I mean, I had many opportunities but some of them were life-threatening, I would say."
1342.0,1343.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my God."
1343.0,1352.0,Subject,"Because my brother-in-law, the way he would start to swim is that his older brother took him out far into the ocean. "
1352.0,1353.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my God."
1353.0,1367.0,Subject,"He was holding him-- he held him by the hands, something like that, ""You're doing fine."" And then he let go. And then he said,"" You better learn how to swim. I'm going back to shore."" And he learned how to swim as he was-- it was a flight or fight instinct that kicked in."
1367.0,1369.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my God."
1369.0,1388.0,Subject,"So he tried the same thing with me, but I was smarter. So I latched on to his leg. I said, ""I bring you down with me."" Because I was pretty heavy at that time, so I was like, ""You're not swimming back any time soon."" He's like, ""Let go [laughter]."" I was like, ""Not until you bring me back."" So he brought me back. And from there, I stayed on the beach where my feet could touch the ground."
1388.0,1390.0,Interviewer,How old were you?
1390.0,1452.0,Subject,"I think I was 15. I was 15. Because we don't really go to beaches as often or swimming because it's pretty busy as a family, as you could say. It's only once every two, three years that my entire family goes to the beach. Aunts and uncles and cousins. It's hard to get us all together. So, yeah. Swimming was traumatic [laughter], as you say. When I was smaller, I tried to learn how to swim in my bathtub but it was kind of small. And it's also hard [laughter] because then I learned that wasting water is bad. So I stopped. I only filled the bathtub to half point. But I couldn't lift myself off the ground. So I just kept on hitting my hand on the bathtub, so it just hurt. So I stopped. I was like, ""Whatever, swimming's for suckers. Running is more--"""
1452.0,1454.0,Interviewer,Your scene.
1454.0,1469.0,Subject,"Yeah. Swimming. I guess I'll do that sometime this summer. I might take some swimming classes. But then again, I want to take more Muay Thai classes. "
1469.0,1471.0,Interviewer,So what exactly is Muay Thai?
1471.0,1562.0,Subject,"Muay Thai is a mixed martial arts derived from Philippines. It's more base driven movement and attacks. It incorporates arms as well, but it's, the longer the leg or the more swing you have in your leg, the more force due on impact. So you see a lot of people with bruises who do Muay Thai. I mean, it seems pretty cool, but it also gets you really toughened out or something like that. I mean, [inaudible] the other day I was practice wrestling with my cousin and I was-- that was years back. So I probably want to do that to strengthen my legs for running mainly and soccer. Because I've had a lot of instances where other players just stepped on my legs and made me bleed. But it won't hurt as much. It doesn't hurt as much. I feel Muay Thai will probably help me with that. It's just, ""Oh, I'm bleeding. Ah, that's cool."" That's just afterthought. Maybe because, I guess, my coach kept on saying I could pass as a Filipino. I was, ""No, I can't [laughter]."" I could probably just sneak into the class, they won't even notice. Probably won't do that, something like that, just fit in."
1562.0,1565.0,Interviewer,And where are the classes?
1565.0,1589.0,Subject,"There's one where I live, say, Queens, in general. Just in general, Queens, [inaudible] just, there's a lot of people that go there. I see them all the time with their gym bags and their little shorts, I guess, you can say. I say, ""Okay. I thought they were going to the gym-gym. But now they're just beating each other up in a dark room."""
1589.0,1592.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my God."
1592.0,1609.0,Subject,"So I think I might joint them to that sometime soon. But definitely, swimming first because when I go the beach-- I want to go to the beach at one point and not just be on the sand and watch my friends just have fun in the water."
1609.0,1617.0,Interviewer,"So what other kind of things do you want to do this summer? We have the beach, you're taking some classes."
1617.0,1717.0,Subject,"I want to take a second job. I'm currently a barista near Hunter where I currently study at. And then there is this other job I'm already applying for. I think even, the position, I just have to fill out my medical history. So I have to call my doctor, but he's on vacation at the moment. So I might take some time and inform them about that. It's a teaching assistant part-time job. So working with kids, helping them with after school work, homework, the curriculum. Prepare them for the next day. I feel like I'd be good with that because I taught my neighbor whose parents are immigrants. So they don't speak a lick of English, which their kid does because he's in the public school system. I helped him sometimes with that. I translate their notices. ""Oh, he has to be immunized to be in school or a trip"", or something like that. And I help him with his homework. It's just, he's very hard-headed, as I was. But he's very hard-headed and that. I try to work on my patience, not very effective. But I feel like this would help me. Just a bunch of eight-year-olds running at me with questions and just me keeping my cool to the best that I can until I snap. Hopefully, I don't snap [laughter]. That'd be terrible. It's the first day, and the first thing I'm gone all this time. "
1717.0,1719.0,Interviewer,"So it's younger children, like eight?"
1719.0,1738.0,Subject,"Yeah. Eight, twelve-ish. I hate teenagers. They're the worst [laughter]. But younger kids, I feel like I do better with than older kids. And then, people my age is just, whatever."
1738.0,1748.0,Interviewer,And do you think teaching is something that-- what made you want to take this job?
1748.0,1783.0,Subject,"The pay is good [laughter]. The pay is really high. It's always a good incentive to have good pay. Also, the reference would be very, very good in the future. I don't want to teach, is just in case there'll be a future opening for a different part-time job that requires a good enough reference from an institution that works with kids, it'd be better if I get one from there. I won't be there forever. I might be there for maybe just a year. And then the last year, I'll just full throttle to dental school. See what happens."
1783.0,1785.0,Interviewer,So this is a pretty long commitment then.
1785.0,1792.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Not that I want to be there for long, but definitely."
