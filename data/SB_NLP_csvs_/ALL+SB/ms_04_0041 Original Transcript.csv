1.0,8.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately? 
8.0,20.0,Subject,"It's okay. I mean, it's very boring. "
20.0,22.0,Interviewer,Boring?
22.0,26.0,Subject,Things have been boring.
26.0,30.0,Interviewer,How so?
30.0,35.0,Subject,Because I lost my bonds with a lot of people.
35.0,36.0,Interviewer,Your bonds?
36.0,39.0,Subject,Yeah. 
39.0,43.0,Interviewer,Do you know why?
43.0,73.0,Subject,"No, I don't. It doesn't make sense, and I've just distanced myself from people because they're not good for me. Well, the things we do are not good for us. So yeah. "
73.0,77.0,Interviewer,What kind of things aren't good?
77.0,92.0,Subject,"Like going out late, drinking, smoking. Yeah. "
92.0,98.0,Interviewer,And what happens when you do?
98.0,118.0,Subject,"I mean, I have fun in the moment, but I get in trouble at home, yeah, because I come home late, and then my mom-- and it just makes things worse in the house. "
118.0,119.0,Interviewer,Worse?
119.0,142.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's worse for everybody else because my mom, she won't sleep until I get home. And we're already having problems. And if I do something that gets them upset, they're going to be more upset with me. "
142.0,144.0,Interviewer,Okay. Already having problems?
144.0,148.0,Subject,Yeah. They're upset with me.
148.0,150.0,Interviewer,They're upset?
150.0,155.0,Subject,"Yeah, because of the things I do."
155.0,156.0,Interviewer,What things?
156.0,158.0,Subject,Because they don't want me to smoke.
158.0,171.0,Interviewer,And what makes you keep smoking?
171.0,183.0,Subject,
183.0,189.0,Interviewer,And how does it make things less boring?
189.0,195.0,Subject,Because it just makes you feel good. 
195.0,196.0,Interviewer,Good?
196.0,201.0,Subject,Yeah. 
201.0,205.0,Interviewer,Good how?
205.0,223.0,Subject,"It just makes my body feel good, and it relaxes my mind. And I don't think. I do think, I just don't worry too much about things. "
223.0,226.0,Interviewer,Do you worry a lot?
226.0,270.0,Subject,"Yeah. In the moment, yeah, and then I do stuff. I do stuff that-- I do stuff, and I'm very dramatic. People say [I'd be doing the most?], but it's just because of what I'm feeling. But then, when I get high, I don't care about it anymore. I do, but I'm just in a different place. I see it in a different point of view. "
270.0,288.0,Interviewer,"And when you're not high, what kinds of things do you find you think about or get worried about? "
288.0,311.0,Subject,"I think about my friends not inviting me places, or I think about something that happened. Like, I don't know, it could be anything, like something that upsets me."
311.0,321.0,Interviewer,So what kinds of things do you think upset you the most? 
321.0,339.0,Subject,"I don't know, like when people are not truthful or when people are not loyal or when people take me for granted."
339.0,341.0,Interviewer, Is that something that's been happening?
341.0,347.0,Subject,Yeah. 
347.0,350.0,Interviewer,A lot?
350.0,353.0,Subject,Yeah. 
353.0,359.0,Interviewer,Can you give me an example?
359.0,469.0,Subject,"Like my best friend, she blocked me on everything for no reason because I was defending-- because she said something about my cousin, and I was defending him because she was saying something about-- that he said something to a 12-year-old. But he would never do something like that. And then she got mad at me because-- she just got mad at me because I was telling her, ""Oh, why was the little girl outside? Why was the little girl in the streets? She shouldn't be in the streets."" And then she was like, ""Oh, don't put it on her. She doesn't know any better."" And I'm like, ""Okay, but she's still 12. She knows what she's doing. I knew better when I was 12. I knew better than I know now."" But my cousin didn't even do anything, and it was just a lie. Because a lot of people lie about my cousin because he does social media, and they try to put a bad image on him. And I asked the little girl too, I asked her like, ""Oh, did that really happen? Because if it did happen, then you know that's wrong? You know that's not right? I'll understand if it something like-- he actually said that and he actually-- that's not good. But I know that he would never do that because he's not like that. He wouldn't do something like that."" And she just blocked me. And--"
469.0,470.0,Interviewer,The girl?
470.0,474.0,Subject,Yeah. My best friend blocked me.
474.0,477.0,Interviewer,"Oh. You also asked the little girl, right?"
477.0,478.0,Subject,Yeah.
478.0,479.0,Interviewer,What did she say?
479.0,488.0,Subject,"She just said she was like, ""Oh--"" she was like, ""I probably got confused with him and another person."""
488.0,489.0,Interviewer,Wow.
489.0,547.0,Subject,"It was a whole lie. It was a lie. And I was telling her, and she didn't understand that because, yeah, she didn't. So she just didn't understand that because people-- girls be throwing themself on him, so that's why I was like, maybe it was her. And she was saying, ""Oh, don't put it on her because she just wants attention."" I'm like, ""Okay. If she wants attention, if she got the attention she wanted, why are you getting mad? That's on her. It was consensual. It's not like he did anything to her."" And I was telling her, like, ""Oh, if she doesn't know any better, then teach her better because when people know better, that's when they will do better."" And then she just got mad at me, and she was like, ""Oh, you don't know any better."" She was like, ""You don't know any better."" And I'm like, ""Okay."" And then she just stopped being friends with me. She was like, ""Oh, losing me, this is on you."" Like, ""What?"" I was like, ""Okay."""
547.0,549.0,Interviewer,How does that make you feel?
549.0,631.0,Subject,"It's stupid. It's just so stupid. It's so stupid. And she's like, ""Oh, you're childish."" Like, ""What? You're--"" and then my cousin texted her so he can clear his name out, and she couldn't even have a conversation with him. But she's accusing. It makes no sense. And then she got somebody else to text me, like her ex to text me, talking about, ""Oh, why you had your cousin text a lady?"" And when my cousin didn't say anything disrespectful to her. So then I started to spaz, and everybody got mad at me. And then I started spazzing, like I was, ""You're a little-ass girl. What are you doing? How you going to stop being friends with me because of this? Just because it's not your way, you think there's no-- it's no way."" And that blew my mind because she was my only friend, my only friend that I actually cared about. The only friend I really thought was going to stay in my life forever. She was my best friend. "
631.0,638.0,Interviewer,What made her your best friend more than other people?
638.0,688.0,Subject,"I don't know. She was just very-- I met her a long time ago. She's a year younger than me. I met her in school. I don't know, we just became best friends because we spent a lot of time together one summer. And, yeah. And we only had each other because a lot of our friends, they're fake. She had her own friends, and I had my own friends, but at the end of the day, we always had each other. So that's why she was my best friend. And my mom knew her, everybody. We just all knew each other. And, yeah."
688.0,694.0,Interviewer,It must be really difficult to lose someone that you felt so close to. 
694.0,709.0,Subject,"I mean, she didn't even check up on me or anything, so was I really losing? I don't know. "
709.0,719.0,Interviewer,Do you think you guys will ever kind of find your way back?
719.0,726.0,Subject,"I mean, if she doesn't-- I mean, yeah, maybe. But that's on her."
726.0,736.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And what do you mean by your other friends are fake? 
736.0,747.0,Subject,"They'll meet up, and they'll hang out without me. But if I was to do that, they'll get mad at me. "
747.0,751.0,Interviewer,That doesn't seem fair. 
751.0,765.0,Subject,"Exactly. And they'll go out, and they wouldn't tell me. They just wouldn't tell me at all. And they will lie. They will be like, ""Oh, I'm alone, so what are you talking about?"" But then I see a picture of them together. "
765.0,767.0,Interviewer,Why do you think they do that? 
767.0,785.0,Subject,"I don't know. Because they're like, ""Oh, you're always with your boyfriend."" I'm like, ""Okay. I don't want to be with him 24/7."" I'm always with him because I have nobody else to be with, and that's why life is kind of boring because I'm always with the same person. "
785.0,789.0,Interviewer,And what do you usually do with him?
789.0,829.0,Subject,"I don't do anything. We just chill. We just sleep, play video games, eat. Hang out with his friends. His friends, not even my friends. And he's older than me, and it's weird because I don't really vibe with his people. And I don't have my people because I don't have any friends. "
829.0,836.0,Interviewer,"Okay, so why don't you vibe with his people, you think?"
836.0,841.0,Subject,I don't know. They're too chill.
841.0,842.0,Interviewer,Too chill?
842.0,854.0,Subject,"Yeah. They're too chill. I don't know, they're too chill. The things they talk about don't interest me. They be talking about weird stuff [laughter]. "
854.0,855.0,Interviewer,Like what?
855.0,865.0,Subject,"I don't know. They just be talking about random stuff, stuff I don't understand most of the time. "
865.0,869.0,Interviewer,Have you guys ever hung out with your friends together?
869.0,900.0,Subject,"Yeah, we used to before, when I had friends. Like, yeah, yesterday, I was with one of friends, and we were going to be together, but then she had to leave because her mom was calling her. And then, yeah. I get along with his friends, they're just not my friends, you know?"
900.0,913.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's fair. And do you guys wish-- or do you wish that you guys did more stuff together? 
913.0,916.0,Subject,Yeah. 
916.0,921.0,Interviewer,What kinds of things would you like to do together?
921.0,923.0,Subject,Go on vacation. 
923.0,926.0,Interviewer,Vacation? Like what?
926.0,933.0,Subject,Like Jamaica or DR. 
933.0,937.0,Interviewer,Why those places?
937.0,958.0,Subject,"Because it's tropical, and I want to go to DR because I want him to meet-- I want him to see where I come from and see my family. And then I want to take him somewhere, and then I want to see his family. "
958.0,959.0,Interviewer,Where is his family?
959.0,962.0,Subject,In DR too. He grew up over there.
962.0,963.0,Interviewer,"Oh, cool. "
963.0,976.0,Subject,"So I just want to go, and I don't know, I just want to have fun, do other stuff, get out of here. "
976.0,979.0,Interviewer,Why do you want to get out of here?
979.0,987.0,Subject,Because it's boring. I'm tired of the city. I want tropical [lands?]. 
987.0,999.0,Interviewer,And what do you think is less boring about tropical lands?
999.0,1006.0,Subject,"I don't know. I think, over there, it's like you get away from everything over here. "
1006.0,1009.0,Interviewer,What kinds of things do you want to get away from?
1009.0,1031.0,Subject,"Everything. You just get away from everything. It's so weird, you can just pack your bags and you leave. You're not taking your home. It's weird, but it feels good. You're just leaving your life behind, and you're like, ""I'm going to come back."""
1031.0,1033.0,Interviewer,You're going to or not going to?
1033.0,1040.0,Subject,"No, like yeah, I'm going to come back. I'm coming back, but I'm leaving. I don't know. "
1040.0,1043.0,Interviewer,Have you ever done that?
1043.0,1044.0,Subject,Yeah. 
1044.0,1048.0,Interviewer,Really? Where did you go?
1048.0,1049.0,Subject,DR. 
1049.0,1052.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you did? By yourself?"
1052.0,1055.0,Subject,"No, with my mom. "
1055.0,1058.0,Interviewer,For how long?
1058.0,1068.0,Subject,"We went for, I think, it was two weeks. Yeah. We went for two weeks. We went for her birthday. "
1068.0,1072.0,Interviewer,What'd you do? 
1072.0,1108.0,Subject,We went to a resort. We went to a Campo. It's called a Campo. Everything is just-- it's just green land everywhere. You just see animals roaming around. There's not really a bathroom. You have to take a shower outside. 
1108.0,1109.0,Interviewer,Whoa. 
1109.0,1152.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's like a little box, and then you have to get water from somewhere so you can take a shower. It's humbling. I like it. It's very nice, and you just see nature. That's how my mom tells me, like, ""Oh, this is how it looks. This is how we grew up."" But in other areas of DR, everything is more advanced. It's not the same as the Campo. And, yeah, it was very fun. [inaudible] motorcycles."
1152.0,1153.0,Interviewer,Whoa. 
1153.0,1160.0,Subject,"And I got burnt, I mean, on my foot, on my leg right here."
1160.0,1162.0,Interviewer,Like sunburn or burn?
1162.0,1164.0,Subject,Burn from the motorcycle.
1164.0,1165.0,Interviewer,Whoa.
1165.0,1168.0,Subject,If you get on the wrong way. Look.
1168.0,1169.0,Interviewer,Oh my God. 
1169.0,1183.0,Subject,"If you get on the wrong way, you're going to burn yourself because in DR, they don't protect you. They just leave it like that. And here, they protect this so you don't get burned."
1183.0,1185.0,Interviewer,But what burns you? 
1185.0,1189.0,Subject,The motor in the bottom. 
1189.0,1191.0,Interviewer,That sounds so painful. 
1191.0,1194.0,Subject,It was fine. 
1194.0,1198.0,Interviewer,Do you think you will end up going with your boyfriend? 
1198.0,1216.0,Subject,"Maybe, yeah, in the future. Once I'm stable financially, and him. I don't have money now, so I can't go anywhere. "
1216.0,1219.0,Interviewer,No young person has money [laughter].
1219.0,1220.0,Subject,No young person has money?
1220.0,1221.0,Interviewer,Yeah. 
1221.0,1224.0,Subject,That's a lie. That's a lie.
1224.0,1226.0,Interviewer,Most young people don't have money. 
1226.0,1232.0,Subject,That's a lie. I know a lot of people that has money my age. 
1232.0,1233.0,Interviewer,How?
1233.0,1242.0,Subject,"I don't know. They're freaking rich. They just be like, ""Okay. Heard you."""
1242.0,1282.0,Interviewer,"Sketchy [laughter]. Okay, so DR is some place you want to go with him. You talked about liking kind of being at one with nature and wanting to avoid this city or get out of here. What do you think is in your future? If you could do anything, where would you go, what would you do? "
1282.0,1299.0,Subject,"If it was just me, I don't know, I think I'd go to Canada. I don't know why. And I'll do YouTube."
1299.0,1301.0,Interviewer,What do you mean? 
1301.0,1303.0,Subject,I'll make YouTube videos.
1303.0,1306.0,Interviewer,Oh. About what?
1306.0,1333.0,Subject,"About [laughter] getting high and doing stuff while being high, like anything. I'll do blogs, or I'll just record a journey so I can-- I don't know. Just anything. "
1333.0,1335.0,Interviewer,What kind of journey? 
1335.0,1348.0,Subject,"Weight loss or moving, anything. "
1348.0,1350.0,Interviewer,"What do you mean, weight loss? "
1350.0,1362.0,Subject,"Weight loss, like a weight loss journey. Keeping track. It would be like a video diary. Yeah. "
1362.0,1367.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that's something you'll do? 
1367.0,1376.0,Subject,I don't know. It sounds fun. And I feel like I always wanted to do it. I don't know. 
1376.0,1388.0,Interviewer,Why Canada? 
1388.0,1409.0,Subject,"Because my dad could go over there. And me and my dad, we had a plan that we were going to-- he was going to go to Canada, and I was going to go be with him. But, yeah. "
1409.0,1414.0,Interviewer,When did you make that plan? 
1414.0,1429.0,Subject,"Like a year ago. I mean, he's been telling me he was going to come. I don't know, he's been in DR."
1429.0,1433.0,Interviewer,How often do you talk to him?
1433.0,1436.0,Subject,[Partly?] every other day. 
1436.0,1444.0,Interviewer,Oh. And when was the last time you saw him? 
1444.0,1450.0,Subject,When I was in DR. It was like April. 
1450.0,1457.0,Interviewer,And what kinds of things do you guys talk about?
1457.0,1483.0,Subject,"Everything. We just talk about his other daughters, the things he wants to do. And he just tells me to-- he just gives me a lot of advice. And, yeah. "
1483.0,1485.0,Interviewer,Advice about what? 
1485.0,1491.0,Subject,About life. 
1491.0,1492.0,Interviewer,What kinds of life advice? 
1492.0,1548.0,Subject,"He just be like, ""Oh, don't be in the streets."" He'd be like, ""Don't be in the streets. The street's not going to take you nowhere."" He's like, ""Stay off the streets. Worry about yourself and your mom."" He's like, ""Don't trust nobody. You don't have any friends. Your only friend is your mom. You can have people you socialize with, but don't trust them."" I don't know, he just tells me to study. He was like, ""Go to school."""
1548.0,1553.0,Interviewer,Do you listen to his advice? 
1553.0,1574.0,Subject,"Yeah, some of it. Like he tells me to stop smoking. That's just one part, and that's it. "
1574.0,1583.0,Interviewer,Why do you think he says you shouldn't trust people?
1583.0,1620.0,Subject,"Because a lot of people done him bad, did bad by him, his friends. And that's who I-- and he got in a lot of trouble because he thought, ""Oh, those are my friends. They're going to have my back,"" but they didn't. And he got into a lot of trouble. He's like, ""Oh, friends only get you into trouble."" Yeah. And it's true."
1620.0,1624.0,Interviewer,How did they get him into trouble?
1624.0,1637.0,Subject,I can't really talk about it. I don't really know. He doesn't really tell me. He's very secretive.
1637.0,1638.0,Interviewer,Secretive?
1638.0,1659.0,Subject,Yeah. He's very secretive. And I don't really know him like that. I started speaking to him like a year ago. He was never consistently in my life. Yeah. 
1659.0,1664.0,Interviewer,And what changed a year ago? 
1664.0,1690.0,Subject,"He tells me to call him. My uncle, he's here, he tells me, ""Oh, your father wants to speak to you. Give him a call. Give him a call."" And I was like, ""Okay."" And then I finally called him one day, and yeah. And from there, we've just been talking. "
1690.0,1712.0,Interviewer,"And so you've been talking to him for like a year, pretty regularly. And before that, why don't you think you guys talked a lot? "
1712.0,1737.0,Subject,"He was just like, ""Oh--"" I don't know. He was working. He was in the streets, and he didn't want to get us involved. But that's what he said, but that's just an excuse. "
1737.0,1740.0,Interviewer,What do you think was the real--?
1740.0,1758.0,Subject,I don't know. I don't know. It doesn't really matter. 
1758.0,1764.0,Interviewer,"Are you happy, though, that he's back in your life? "
1764.0,1781.0,Subject,"I guess. Yeah, you could say that. "
1781.0,1793.0,Interviewer,"And before, you were talking about-- he said that you can only trust your mom. Are you guys close? "
1793.0,1796.0,Subject,Not really. 
1796.0,1800.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that is? 
1800.0,1806.0,Subject,Because she doesn't understand me. 
1806.0,1809.0,Interviewer,What doesn't she understand?
1809.0,1829.0,Subject,"I don't know, a lot of things. She doesn't understand me. They rebuttal each other, and I'm like-- yeah. "
1829.0,1833.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] about--?
1833.0,1872.0,Subject,"What I should be doing, yeah, or, when I was younger, it was about how I used to dress. I always had a different perspective on things. I always wanted to do things a different way, and she wanted me to do it how it was supposed to be. She's like, ""It's supposed to be like this."" And I was like, ""No, it's not. You could do whatever you want."""
1872.0,1880.0,Interviewer,And that's still the case? You guys still have this--
1880.0,1881.0,Subject,Yeah.
1881.0,1885.0,Interviewer,--tension?
1885.0,1887.0,Subject,[inaudible].

1890.0,1929.0,Subject,"Yeah. My brother, he told me this last night. He was like, ""I think Mommy's sick and she doesn't want to tell us."" Because she has something in her lungs. It's something called-- I forgot. But she takes antibiotics for it, and she told me it's something that can lead to cancer or, I don't know. She's the type to not say anything."
1929.0,1939.0,Interviewer,How do you know about what's in her lungs?
1939.0,1943.0,Subject,Because she told us. 
1943.0,1945.0,Interviewer,And so you think it's worse?
1945.0,1964.0,Subject,"Yeah. What my brother thinks is that it's worse than she says it is, like she's not telling us the full truth. I don't know. "
1964.0,1968.0,Interviewer,Why do you think she wouldn't tell you the truth? 
1968.0,1973.0,Subject,I don't know. 
1973.0,1979.0,Interviewer,That must be really scary. How old is your brother?
1979.0,1982.0,Subject,He's 25.
1982.0,1992.0,Interviewer,"Oh, so he's older. Do you think you'll talk to her about it? "
1992.0,2010.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I make sure she takes her pills every night. I told her to take it, and yeah. "
