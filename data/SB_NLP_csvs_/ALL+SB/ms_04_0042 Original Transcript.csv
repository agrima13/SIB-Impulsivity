1.0,6.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So the first question I'm just going to ask you is, how have things been going for you lately?"
6.0,9.0,Subject,"Good. Things are looking up, I hope. [crosstalk]."
9.0,10.0,Interviewer,Good.
10.0,21.0,Subject,"Yeah. Just taking it day to day, week by week. Not the most stable place to live in this city, but--"
21.0,22.0,Interviewer,What do you mean? 
22.0,26.0,Subject,"Just juggling different jobs and everything, but--"
26.0,32.0,Interviewer,So you said things are looking up. What does up look like?
32.0,57.0,Subject,"Started a new website. Trying to get out of teaching. I've been a teacher for the last 10 years or more, but now I'm trying to get into photography and go on with some different directions. But yeah."
57.0,63.0,Interviewer,So we talked about what up looks like. What does down look like?
63.0,90.0,Subject,"Oh, okay. Okay. Well, I've been in New York for two years or a year and a half now. I've been in therapy for about a year. And I've reached a point where I'm just, ""Oh, my God."" Well, seeing all my problems and stuff like that and kind of making a shift."
90.0,95.0,Interviewer,What do you think those problems are? What's come up?
95.0,153.0,Subject,"Just codependency. I was really depressed before. I had a really bad alcohol problem. I've been trying to stay away from that, and therapy has been a big help for me. I'm really grateful to be in New York because of that because I was living abroad for 10 years. Yeah. Grew up in a really small town in Ohio and then did all of my schooling there. And then left the country for 10 years. Just went to all kinds of random places, and then moved back here. And it's a long story, but [laughter]--"
153.0,154.0,Interviewer,We got time. 
154.0,184.0,Subject,"But do [inaudible]. But yeah. I don't know. I always thought I had a good upbringing and everything, good parents, good family. And they are. But I don't know. I feel like, any day now, in therapy, I'm just going to be like, ""Oh, my God."" It's like finding out some things I don't want to know or things that just kind of test reality, but--"
184.0,186.0,Interviewer,Has that happened already?
186.0,204.0,Subject,"I feel like it's about to. Luckily, my therapist is getting married now. She's on her honeymoon for the next two weeks. I won't be meeting with her. But she's been so much help. But yeah. I don't know why I'm even crying right now [laughter]."
204.0,207.0,Interviewer,It's okay. One of my [inaudible] [crosstalk].
207.0,208.0,Subject,"Oh, thanks [laughter]."
208.0,209.0,Interviewer,Yes. 
209.0,233.0,Subject,"When I get to the point in therapy where I just start talking and just start talking about pizza, and then I just start crying. And it's bizarre. It's like some kind of thing, voodoo or something. Like, ""Why the hell does that happen?"" Just start talking about traumas and stuff. But yeah. But it's been really helpful. "
233.0,236.0,Interviewer,So you think talking about it is helping?
236.0,287.0,Subject,"That, and also medications. I'm taking a couple of medications. I had a couple of therapists in the past, but I feel like this one, she understands. People always are either-- well, you hear a lot of people saying things about how great therapy is, and I didn't believe it. But now, a year in, I'm like, ""Oh, my God. Wow."" But it's good just having some kind of self-respect and--"
287.0,290.0,Interviewer,So it's helped you bolster that self-respect?
290.0,383.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. You just start feeling-- I've been really kind of a people-pleaser, always worried about other people, what they think and stuff and taking the blame for everything even when it's not my fault. But every day, I get confronted and have that anxiety, and even just to meet with friends or talk with friends or family. I was drinking. I still do, sometimes. But the medications I'm on have been helping a lot, and I don't need them as much. But every day, I have to deal with people. I'm a teacher, and I never really wanted to get into that, to teaching. It just kind of happened. But I'm teaching two courses at a college here, and then it's tough planning [laughter]. But once I actually stop feeling anxious, I can do well. But yeah. "
383.0,392.0,Interviewer,"So when you say that you have been really focused on pleasing people, what do you mean by that? "
392.0,503.0,Subject,"Yeah. Just wanting them to not think negatively of me and everything. I guess always worried about everything I say and everything like that and offending people. And just me being overly careful, just not to offend-- well, what I think people want to hear and not being authentic and stuff like that. But yeah, just even within the last couple of weeks, there's been a shift [laughter]. For example, even in the evenings, I sit as like a receptionist at a school on Time Square. And people are like, ""Oh, do you have any cups?"" I'm like, ""No. You bring your own damn water bottle [laughter]."" Just stuff like that. ""It's not our responsibility. Bring your own water bottle."" And at first, just a couple of weeks ago, I was like, ""I'm so sorry. We don't have that."" Kind of taking the blame. And people will just want to be mad and have someone to be mad at because they're thirsty and they don't want to go outside [laughter]. So now I'm like, ""No. You can bring a water bottle next time. We're not responsible for providing stupid cups."" And then they feel stupid [laughter] and go away. But yeah. Yeah. "
503.0,506.0,Interviewer,"Did it make you feel better, empowered?"
506.0,550.0,Subject,"Yeah. Definitely. They also respond to me a bit better. I'd always kind of maybe send out vibes, ""Oh, I want you to like me. I'm so sorry that you have been inconvenienced."" And now, they're like, ""Oh, okay."" And now they're kind of respecting me a little more. So I've also noticed a lot of shifts and uncomfortable interactions with people at different places I've worked just because I'm sending different energy out. Yeah. That stuff's definitely real [laughter]. And yeah. But--"
550.0,551.0,Interviewer, That stuff?
551.0,564.0,Subject,Sending out energy and vibes because I've always just-- because I still can't really make eye contact with people when I'm talking to them. It's weird.
564.0,565.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] [laughter]. 
565.0,591.0,Subject,"When I was living abroad, I didn't have to worry about talking to people all the time. Or at least, there'd be a language barrier. But here, it's like most of the-- well, more than half the time, I'm talking to people, and you have to worry about your tone of voice all the time, everything. But-- "
591.0,598.0,Interviewer,So what do you think makes you anxious about talking to people? 
598.0,655.0,Subject,"Maybe just worrying about their thoughts about me. Trying to control that or something. Or for a long time, I haven't been going on dates or anything like that. I don't even want to deal with guys at the moment until I start feeling a lot better. But I couldn't even have conversations. I'm just so nervous. I would have never been able to go out without having a couple of drinks, being tipsy. And then I'd show up, and it's like 6 PM, and they're like, ""Ooh."" "
655.0,656.0,Interviewer,You'd do that?
656.0,675.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. Definitely. I realize it's not cool. At least I'm realizing now, like, ""Whoa."" Yeah. That's really not like a normal functioning human should be. But-- "
675.0,680.0,Interviewer,"Are you interested in dating eventually, after [crosstalk]?"
680.0,795.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'd like to just eventually get [inaudible]. Worry about making friends first. And that's been happening slowly. I'm always busy. I've just been trying to-- it's something that's very recent is making friends, being able to talk to people, relearning how to have conversations with people, and even just two-way conversations without giving unsolicited advice. I've been doing a lot of work outside of class. I mean, outside of my therapy sessions. My therapist hasn't even told me directly if she can diagnose me or classify me as some kind of-- giving me a label. But just taking what she says and then going and listening to podcasts from different therapists about different disorders or whatever and realizing, ""Oh, wow. Oh, my God. That's me [laughter]."" I've been trying not to be overly looking into things too much just because if you go on Google, you can convince yourself of anything. But with a lot of these things, I've been really spot-on. But--"
795.0,798.0,Interviewer,At working on research [crosstalk]?
798.0,809.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Just kind of-- and it's good. Awareness is everything, but I'm just--"
809.0,815.0,Interviewer,So do you think it helps you to have those labels? 
815.0,843.0,Subject,"It does, just to kind of make some-- kind of make something out of a big mess, something tangible. But yeah, labels definitely help for me just to understand stuff. But I know not everything can be 100%, but--"
843.0,852.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Sometimes, it also helps to know that if there's a label for it, it means other people also feel the same thing. "
852.0,854.0,Subject,Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. 
854.0,867.0,Interviewer,"Feeling all alone. And a lot of people find that aspect of it, like being in a box, sometimes makes people unhappy, but also knowing that other people are in that box helps. "
867.0,1014.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. Because for so long, I was like, ""What's wrong with me? Why am I doing this?"" But I didn't know I had to drink all the time. And now I'm not doing that, luckily or thankfully. But I just kept repeating the same things again and again, the same patterns. And with my therapy, I've been encouraged to do the opposite because I kept doing the same thing again and again. And now that I'm doing things differently, I'm feeling a lot better. I always get these guys that I'm not interested in. I'm always afraid of saying something or making them feel bad or something. Even though I'm not interested at all, I'm just like, ""Okay.""  But even last weekend, I went to a festival to take photos. And some guy was nagging me, kind of insulting and stuff like that. He wasn't handsome, wasn't tall. This guy was just-- I don't know why he just assumed I would be interested in him and stuff. He kept calling me old, and now he's only like 26 and [inaudible]. Yeah. I didn't tell him this. But I was thinking [inaudible]. But yeah, just now I'm trying to think of how I'm going to-- I've just been trying to listen to my gut and things like that about things now. If I have bad feelings about people, don't ignore them, bad feelings about people, about situations. So I'm relearning that because I think so many times in my life, growing up, I was just kind of told, ""Don't listen to those."" "
1014.0,1016.0,Interviewer,[Who were you told by?]?
1016.0,1024.0,Subject,Maybe where I was taught that. 
1024.0,1025.0,Interviewer,How?
1025.0,1050.0,Subject,"I don't know. Just a lot of uncomfortable things have happened over the years, and they've just--"
1050.0,1052.0,Interviewer,Uncomfortable? 
1052.0,1118.0,Subject,"I'm trying to think. I don't know how to explain it. I think just within the last week-- my dad, he passed away 10 years ago. And I'm realizing he was probably a bit of a narcissist. And I'm just coming to that conclusion now and seeing how-- I know the generation before that is really screwed up. I've cut that side of the family out of the picture. But it's kind of like that generation and the next generation and the next generation, how it kind of gets handed down. But yeah, it's stuff like that. "
1118.0,1132.0,Interviewer,And so you mentioned the word relearn a couple of times. So do you think that you trusted your gut more before? It seems as though you kind of lost track of that for a while.
1132.0,1134.0,Subject,I don't know.
1134.0,1136.0,Interviewer,"But you have before, and now you're relearning it. "
1136.0,1151.0,Subject,I don't know if that's something I've really ever had. I remember never really having to make my own decisions about things. 
1151.0,1153.0,Interviewer,Who made the decision?
1153.0,1171.0,Subject,"My dad. And then when he passed away, I was just like, ""What do I do now?"" But I mean, I've still had a good 10 years of adulthood and everything, 10-plus years. "
1171.0,1173.0,Interviewer,What kind of decisions was he making?
1173.0,1260.0,Subject,"Just all of the major decisions because I didn't really have a strong sense of identity. My identity was always what other people made it. It's weird. I'm still trying to figure all that out [laughter]. Yeah, it's been probably most of my time when I'm not-- I'm pretty busy juggling jobs and stuff. That takes a lot of cognitive energy. But when I have time or I'm just sitting on the subway and just listening to different things on YouTube mostly about codependency, about stop people-pleasing, about just things that you should do differently. Still trying to understand men [laughter]. Yeah. I'd rather not bother with them, even though you get super lonely. But kind of staying at one step at a time. "
1260.0,1271.0,Interviewer,So what do you think-- [inaudible] [laughter].
1271.0,1273.0,Subject,"Sorry, my eyelashes are coming off. "
1273.0,1274.0,Interviewer,Nice. 
1274.0,1275.0,Subject,Oops. 
1275.0,1276.0,Interviewer,Didn't notice. 
1276.0,1296.0,Subject,"Yeah. I had a feeling I might start crying, so it was like, ""Oh, really?"" I usually sleep with my makeup on because I don't have time to even wash my face makeup off. It's like, ""All right. I'm only going to get about four hours of sleep, so."" "
1296.0,1297.0,Interviewer,Wow. Four hours. 
1297.0,1299.0,Subject,Sometimes. 
1299.0,1300.0,Interviewer,"Oops. Oh, gosh."
1300.0,1307.0,Subject,"But today, it was like a good 12. A solid 12. "
1307.0,1308.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]?
1308.0,1312.0,Subject,"Yeah. Made up for it, but--"
1312.0,1316.0,Interviewer,So what prevents you from sleeping?
1316.0,1320.0,Subject,Mostly work.
1320.0,1326.0,Interviewer,Wow. So it's like you'll do a night shift or something?
1326.0,1346.0,Subject,"Well, no, I'm usually working reception until 11:00 PM. And then, sometimes, I stay over there just to work on stuff because I can't really do a lot at my apartment. "
1346.0,1348.0,Interviewer,What kind of stuff do you work on after?
1348.0,1369.0,Subject,Just mostly teaching and preparing lessons and stuff like that and working on my website. Also dealing with some other people's problems. 
1369.0,1371.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]?
1371.0,1425.0,Subject,"One of my supervisors just got fired today, so he wants me to-- I kind of saw it coming. But he asked me to write him a reference for another job. So I was taking some time to do that because I've had a lot of people help me out in the past, and I want to help some other people, friends and stuff out. But yeah. Time on the subway, time-- yeah, I don't really have time to cook or do anything like that. But I don't know where the time goes. It just--"
1425.0,1426.0,Interviewer,Evaporates?
1426.0,1435.0,Subject,Yeah. Evaporates on [110% degree a day?] 
1435.0,1460.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you said that you're feeling lonely. What do you think-- you said men maybe aren't worth the trouble. What do you think makes you feel that way?
1460.0,1648.0,Subject,"I don't know.  Yeah. Just being in New York. When I was living in other places, there are usually other people who are also lonely or they couldn't speak the local language. And, usually, you didn't feel so bad because you're like, ""All right."" Well, you can only communicate on a third-grade level, so it was hard to really-- you didn't feel so bad not making friends and stuff. But now, here, everyone's busy. You need to make plans like two weeks ahead of time. I even had a few people reach out to me, but it's like I don't know how to find time to meet up. There's just no time. It's still crazy how much you have to do here and barely pay rent, even when you're sharing with four people. It's crazy. But I do try to do things to feel good. I go shopping at thrift stores. The only thing I really own are clothes. But I do have a-- you wouldn't guess from today, but I do have a lot of good clothes. My room's the size of this office and has a twin-size bed. And you walk in, and you feel like you're at a little tiny thrift store in the village. From floor to ceiling, it's all-- I'm pretty satisfied with how organized it is. I was never organized growing up, but that's something I've been working on in therapy, just making small changes on how to be organized. And that's been making me feel a million times better. When I have time to do laundry, I feel like such an adult. I'm like, ""Whoa."" It's ridiculous. But luckily, I don't have to do laundry too often because I have so many clothes. Mostly, just some jeans and some underwear I wash, but that's it. But yeah, if I ever was not able to use the washing machine, I'd be clothed probably for about a good six months [laughter]."
1648.0,1654.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk]. Wow.
1654.0,1655.0,Subject,It's ridiculous. 
1655.0,1656.0,Interviewer,Impressive. 
1656.0,1658.0,Subject,It is [laughter].
1658.0,1664.0,Interviewer,Is it something that-- it's something you must enjoy then?
1664.0,1723.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've always enjoyed dressing well and stuff. But even growing up, it wasn't like a really wealthy family or anything. But we did go to a lot of thrift stores and stuff like that. But New York City, it's a little more expensive. But there are some places out in Queens that-- yesterday, I was supposed to go to a dentist appointment, and they canceled after I was all the way out there. And I was like, ""[inaudible]. I'll just go to the thrift store."" I was really mad. And then I went there, and I was like, ""Ooh, yeah."" Yeah. Sometimes, I have dreams about [laughter] shopping. So it's weird. But yeah. "
1723.0,1726.0,Interviewer,Are there other things like that?
1726.0,1762.0,Subject,Yeah. Photography. I get really excited when I finally get some good photos. I've always been good with composition and stuff. But learning how to actually use the camera has been challenging. But luckily--
1762.0,1764.0,Interviewer,What kind of camera?
1764.0,1788.0,Subject,"It's a DSLR, Canon 80D. Yeah. So my brother, he's an editor for a music magazine. So he gets me a lot of gigs. So I go to a lot of concerts for free."
1788.0,1789.0,Interviewer,Nice. 
1789.0,1842.0,Subject,"Yeah. And normally, it's the only way I really get out and practice. I've gone to some classes here in the city. And I try to teach myself. But I go to different concerts and festivals just as an excuse or a way to get motivated to take photos because otherwise, even after work, after all that, even after doing your nails or some other kind of task, you're just too tired. But yeah. So that's been fun. "
1842.0,1846.0,Interviewer,What got you into photography?
1846.0,1915.0,Subject,"My mom. She's an artist. My parents owned an art gallery for 25 years back in Ohio. My grandma was an artist. My aunts and uncles on that side of the family are artists. My cousins are artists. It's in the blood, maybe, if that's really a thing. But maybe just having so much exposure to it. I was always kind of pressured to go into that area or something in the arts. But I was abroad for so many years, and other than clothes, I didn't really have anything. And I was just living out of a suitcase. And when you have photos, yeah, it kind of takes you back to places that you just remember everything just by looking at it better than anything else."
1915.0,1922.0,Interviewer,And what brought you abroad for so much time?
1922.0,2027.0,Subject,"Well, when I was in high school or before I was graduating high school, I still didn't know what to do in college. And my dad was like, ""Okay. Well, why don't you be an exchange student because it's better just to learn a language and learn about a different culture than just go and pay 15,000 a year to study something that you don't know what you want to do?"" But I still don't really know what I want to do. But now, half a lifetime later, I do. Or no, that age times two later, I've a better grasp on life, I hope. Anyway, I got a little off-topic. Yeah. He encouraged me to be an exchange student. And I did that for a year, and it kind of blew my mind coming from a little village in the Midwest where you have no exposure to people from other places. New York's a different story. But going from that and being like, ""Oh, my gosh."" Getting [inaudible] to another country, your mind just explodes. But yeah, literally, rips at the seams, but--"
2027.0,2028.0,Interviewer,What do you mean?
2028.0,2068.0,Subject,"Well, I don't know. Out in that part of the country, it's so isolated that people can't really understand that there is more to the world, outside Ohio, outside the US. So experiencing that at that time in my life, I was like, ""Whoa. This is crazy."" But yeah. "
2068.0,2069.0,Interviewer,"Well, it seems like it's stayed with you a long time. "
2069.0,2108.0,Subject,"It did. It did. I went and studied teaching in college because I knew I could travel and stuff after that. And I did get a lot of opportunities. Then I went on and got my master's after that at the same school. Around the same time, my dad died. So I could help my mom with stuff. And then, after that, I just was like, ""[inaudible] [laughter]."" Just kept going to different places. Couldn't stay in one place for more than like a year. But it was good. "
2108.0,2110.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that was?
2110.0,2177.0,Subject,"I don't know. I kept hoping that I'd fall in love or find the right place. Or I wanted to love a place, but something just didn't work out. Or my contract would end, and there wasn't the funding to do another year there. Or a project would get canceled half-way through, so. But yeah. So I was just kind of like, ""All right. Well, it's a big world. I'll keep going. I'll just go somewhere else."" And I'd find something. But my field has changed a lot over the last few years because [inaudible] globalization, everybody is teaching English abroad now. So the salaries are not what they were five years ago. So yeah, I did the Peace Corps for a little while. "
2177.0,2178.0,Interviewer,Wow.
2178.0,2273.0,Subject,"But yeah. And then I went back to Ohio for a little bit because I ran out of money after the Peace Corps. And my brother and his family were living here, at the time, in the city. And they felt kind of sorry because I was in Ohio, and I went out one night and didn't go home. My mom was freaking out. She really overreacted though because even my friends are like, ""What?"" But she called the police and everything. I understand, but it was still kind of-- I don't know. But anyway, that happened. And my brother was like, ""Hey, you can come to New York and try to find a job here, hang out with your niece."" I was like, ""Okay."" So I came here, and I stayed with them for like two months out in Queens. And then they left the city June of last year, and then I stayed. But yeah, that's how I got here. But yeah, New York's been good. It's not an easy place to settle into, but there are a lot of-- at this moment, I'm feeling pretty positive about it. "
2273.0,2274.0,Interviewer,That's great. 
2274.0,2286.0,Subject,"But you have a lot of opportunities, and anything's possible. A lot of clichés are true, but--"
