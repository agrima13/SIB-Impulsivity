1.0,8.0,Interviewer,"We're very interested [about you?]. Okay, cool. So how have things been putting on for you lately?"
8.0,292.0,Subject,"I would say things are going well. I'll summate everything for about the last month. So I graduated on an adult education program [inaudible] school about a month ago. I was studying to be a software engineer. I focus in making Android apps. It was a great year's experience being in that program. I've learned a lot of things that not just built my skills as a software engineer, but in life just building grit, which I've taken a stride and tried to move forward with that. Met a lot of amazing people from different walks of life who made you realize we're all kind of going through the same thing. Unfortunately, the way we graduated was very abrupt, so it sucks how we went from brothers and sisters one day to no communication, nothing whatsoever the next. But hopefully, we'll have a little reunion. But that was school a month ago. I've been looking for work for a while. I don't know why this job market is like this. But I eventually found a job at Madison Square Garden. I'm starting tomorrow, full time, as a waitress, which is exciting. I do like the stadium circuit. It's a little bit more fast-paced, a lot more faces to see, and you just make a lot more money a lot easier, so. I'm excited to be there, especially because I have a lot of old coworkers from my last favorite job. I worked at Citi Field. And they were actually part of the reason why I got the job. Getting five recommendations is kind of like, ""Okay, just give her the job already."" So I'll be starting that full time, but it'll be cool. Just can't wait to make some money. In the meantime, since I haven't been at work-- let's say, I'll go for my daily. I guess I really-- I've been trying to stay organized with my goals and goal-planning. So I wake up in the morning, check my emails first thing - that's probably around 11:00, 12:00, at latest - I meditate, go on YouTube, listen to some sounds, watch videos, trying to educate myself one little-- just [worldly?] things for about a hour, hour or two maybe, then I go and relax a little bit. My little sister, she's 20, try to enlighten her about the world - because she's very sheltered [laughter] - talk to my friends, probably go out very quickly just to get some food. I probably read a little bit. I'm trying to think what I do. Oh. So computer stuff are probably engaged in my hobby, which is when building apps or building some type of game, or I will be looking up my stocks or my forex indicators just to see what I'm doing there. That's one of my major goals, is to really dive deep into investing and stocks. I've had quite a few people around me from high school, and such blow up because they actually dove in. And it's funny because I have-- one of the most successful of the bunch, he says, ""If I could do it - look at me, I'm a millionaire, I own a penthouse - you could have done it."" I was like, ""But money--"" so whatever. That's whatever. It's going to happen eventually [laughter]. And I've been planning how I'm going to change my lifestyle in accordance to eating better, joining a gym - things like that - budgeting, making sure that-- now that I do have an income, I'm not going to be spending all of my income. So I'm trying [inaudible] my means, budgeting - let's see - planning-- oh, and a drop-shipping business. So I do want to open a store, a Shopify store. And I've been researching, planning my inventory, contacting sellers on inventory and make sure I can get my shipping down. Yeah. It's been quite busy, but at the same time, not busy. It makes me happy to know that I'm actually doing a whole lot of stuff. Because when I'm not, I feel stagnant and I feel bored, and I'm like, ""What's going on [inaudible]?"" So that's been really much for the past month. Things will change, but I don't intend for them to [inaudible] anytime soon. Yeah."
292.0,293.0,Interviewer,Sounds like you don't have a full life [laughter].
293.0,294.0,Subject,Yeah. I try. I try.
294.0,298.0,Interviewer,And will you keep up with all these when you start work tomorrow?
298.0,430.0,Subject,"So I will [lie?] my app building. I'm putting a little bit of a pause on it. And I know, they try to tell you, ""Don't pause. You have to keep coding every day."" Well, that's very intensive. It's cute. I might do maybe one or two puzzles in the morning. But as far as building app, probably, I won't keep up with that as much. I do have a limit on how long I'm going to defer that because I do know, like they say, ""If you don't use it, you lose it."" So I don't want to lose it like I lost speaking Chinese or Mandarin. So, yeah, I'm deferred on that for now. But hobbies-wise, the things I do for fun, I'm always finding time for that. It's never anything versus like, ""Oh, I got to fit that in."" That happens whenever I can. If I'm busy and I know I have things to get done, those take priority. So I stuck those up first. And yeah, that's it. The way I'm going to be trying to balance everything is once I do get my schedule-- and I anticipate that I'll be working full time, mostly nighttime, because it's Madison Square Garden. I'll be waitressing in the events and the luxury suites. So I assume that it'll be later. So anything that I have to do as far as my business, as far as my stocks, that'll be early in the morning, which is I already take care of at that time now, so that's not too much of a problem. And stocks coming-- well, forex is 24/5, so I also don't really have to worry about it. I can always check on my phone really quick to make sure I'm not going in the red or anything like that, so. That's not too much. Over the year, this last year, September, 2018 to September, 2019, has been very eventful. And just like I said, building personal skills, better time management, being accountable, learning to fail forward, things like that. I'm just trying to-- I do think that school pursuit and I do think [inaudible] for giving me the opportunity to learn with them, I'd take that moving forward with everything. Yeah."
430.0,437.0,Interviewer,"And when you say eventful, are those the things that you've described with me just now or are there other things that have made it eventful?"
437.0,474.0,Subject,"Oh, at school? Oh [laughter]. Well, school was a lot. So we started September, 2018-- excuse me for looking up. I'm just trying to recall [laughter]. I didn't anticipate. I went in and I was just like, ""I'm just going to do what I got to do. I'm not going to care about nobody. [inaudible] everybody else. I was going to learn."" Apparently, majority of my classmates, we all felt the same, becoming very close. Those are my brothers and sisters, unfortunately."
474.0,475.0,Interviewer,And why unfortunately?
475.0,1006.0,Subject,"Because I don't get to see them anymore [laughter]. I really like to be with somebody eight hours a day, six days a week, and just dropped to be nothing. That's just like, ""Damn."" I want to know how they're doing. My biggest thing is I want to know that they all got jobs. I hope that I'm the last person who didn't get the software engineering job. ""You're at Facebook. You're at Instagram [laughter]. You're at Twitter. You're at Uber. Great, guys. That's all I want to hear."" I just want to know that they're doing well. Oh, yeah. So we started school September. We all slowly got close. Man, that program. The rate of learning was very exponential. We had to learn a new topic. It started off slow, and then we were learning a new topic every day. Every day. And there was no time to review or anything. Tests were coming up and everything. It was very, very intense. I would say eventful, good and bad, rollercoaster, definitely. Because I remember, by the time it was-- late November. So yeah, a little bit later [inaudible], man, I buzzed off all my hair. I was crying. I was like, ""Oh, my God. I can't figure out anything."" Like, ""I should know this, and I [inaudible] my head."" But when it gets to the-- I get that blank-screen syndrome and I always freeze, I don't know what to do anymore. And I was beating myself up hard about it. And apparently, a lot of my classmates [inaudible] more too. And my instructor, who was also part of the program two years prior, said he did the same thing. He had [inaudible] mental breakdown at the back of the class crying, kicking, and screaming like, ""I can't do this anymore."" I'm like, wow, we really all kind of went through it. So yeah, it was hard. I was hard on myself that November towards December. But I was still focused on my school very much so, making sure that I was getting all my assignments, try to do as much review as possible, trying to get the 40 hours in at school plus the 20 hours studying at home that they required from us [laughter]. The work was intensive, but it paid off in the end. Let me see at fast forward. We had quite a few projects that kind of just lifted my morale as we kept going. I'm like, ""Oh, wow. I can really do this,"" ""Oh, wow, I just did this, and nobody else was going to do this,"" teaching myself things, and going to my classmates whenever I needed things, learning how to communicate with people a little bit better, or seeking help-- big thing for me-- seeking help when I really need it instead of being [inaudible] and [keeping them off?] close in trying to figure it out; breaking those type of habits, that was good. Also, my slight little [inaudible] not really trusting them. I learned to trust my instructors and the people above me a little bit more, knowing that they actually had good intentions for me as well. Okay. I'd say [inaudible]. That's basically how it's been up until March. Then March comes and we're approaching graduation, which graduation was actually supposed to be in July. And because of all the things that we were doing, it ended up getting pushed back until September. So we have a few big milestones that we have to complete. We almost [inaudible] on where we have a designated time, 48 hours, and we had to build a functional app - app store-ready app - in 48 hours with a group of four. So they assigned us our groups. We picked-- I believe it was-- yes, we picked, unfortunately-- we picked from a few of the topics we would wanted to cover, and then they kind of randomized us into groups. We worked together. Luckily, my best friend in the class was in the group with me. So she was project manager-- well, we hand off on roles, but project manager design lead. Then I had another [inaudible], Lola. She's also very smart. She's the tech lead. And Lewis, who actually ended up leaving the program early after our project, he was also tech lead because it was kind of a hard position to work, so they kind of tag-team doing that. It was a great app. We've ended up, of course, making an app about educating people on the stock market [laughter], of course. It was cool. We didn't win any prizes that night, but we also didn't really care. And it was more beneficial to us because we saw how we could work together. We could actually be in a professional setting at work and do this and make a feasible product. It was great. Everybody liked our new product. We've done our little personal touches on there, tried things that were new even though we had only 48 hours. And then if it was too hard of a task to complete - so tomorrow would take it to complete - we would just speak with an adviser like, ""Scrub it?"" ""Yeah."" ""Okay,"" and then move on. Sometimes you have to do that. So that was Hackathon. It was great. That was, I believe, the beginning of April. Yes, the very beginning. And then immediately after that, we launched into Capstone, which was a six-week long project. We had to make a actual real, real app for the app store that was being presented in front of Google and our brain trust and all of our investors and everything like that. And they told us, it was like, ""It's going to be stressful."" And it was. It was very stressful. It was as intense as our school schedule already was, being there eight hours a day, six days a week. We were there seven days a week, 12 hours a day, maybe more, working on this project trapped in a room about this small or maybe even smaller, staring at same people in the face for 12 hours. Problems arise all the time. Communication, it breaks. So there's not a tension, but-- I'm not going to say I was immune to that. That's not true [laughter]. My group with [inaudible] advisers, we thought we were going to be immune to that. I kind of didn't because I kind of realized. Initially, I was like, ""Wow. One of these people--"" I didn't realize ""I'm going to have a problem with these people. We're going to clash."" the criticism. Take what you need, throw away the rest, and then just do-- we have to do to make a better product."" So we did it [laughter] eventually. Practice was very, very hard. They had to stay late even though some people-- they have family priorities, children in those homes too. People lived in Jersey had to take the train on the [inaudible], but [laughter] it doesn't matter. They wanted this to be perfect. And that day, Capstone day, in front of Google, not a single slip up, not a single stutter, not a single technical difficulty, none of that. Everything went so smooth. And nobody was even nervous to have this whole panel of all these big-time millionaire, billionaire CEOs and stuff from all these apps. Nobody was even shaken up by it. Everybody did amazingly. And of course, my group killed the whole show. Everyone was like, ""Oh, my God. We want to download your app. Are you going to release it? When are you releasing it?"" I mean, we're supposed to, but we didn't because two of my teammates actually ended up getting jobs immediately after. So we couldn't continue to work on the project because they already have their $100,000 job, so they don't really care about it anymore. But it was a dating app. It was a dating app. Basically, a clone. It was a clone of - what's that [inaudible]? - OkCupid, and a little bit of a mix of-- what is that thing called? Hinge? I think that's the one designed to be [inaudible]. Yeah, I believe so [laughter]."
1006.0,1007.0,Interviewer,[Not so bad?].
1007.0,1182.0,Subject,"[They stole?] the idea. So it was OkCupid. But then being that you also have those little survey questions that you take, based on those answers, they would also recommend you places to go out on a date because the main promise or the main idea that launched the app was we don't know where to take people out on a date even if we do have anything in common. So that was the app. It was great, successful. Everybody was like, ""Can we get on that [laughter]?"" ""In a week. We'll see."" But yeah, it was very eventful. And actually, for me to say that everything ended very abruptly would be a little bit of a lie. It actually ended abruptly right after that. It was June 18th, and I know one of my groupmates - the one who I had anticipated we're going to have a problem with - he told us, he was like, ""I'm not going to matter after this."" I was like, ""I understand."" He was like, ""The next time you see me, I'm going to be coming in to [inaudible],"" which is our ceremony when somebody gets that job. And that's exactly what he did. In two weeks later, he was like [laughter]-- and I was like, ""Yeah, you said it. You said you're going to do it, and you did it. I'm proud of you."" So yeah, June 18th was basically the real day I kind of stopped seeing everybody, because that was the big blowout. We presented to Google, we popped champagne, everything's good. And then graduation kind of got pushed back, pushed back, pushed back, and then nobody showed up for graduation. It was only me and two other people. I was like, ""Wow. Thanks, guys. I love you. Miss you too [laughter],"" but whatever. Yeah, it was still a great experience. November now. Yeah. I can still always go back to the school. I'm an alumni. I can always go back and just see if anybody is ever there, but I know they won't be. It was also up and down. I don't know [inaudible] all along, but because we would've still been in the school and I'd still probably be focused on my software engineering had they [inaudible] with my program. The school decided to drop Android and just focus on iOS and full stack, so. Everybody was greatly broken up about that because it also took away opportunities not only for us to get review, to have support in the advancement of our career, but job opportunities. I intended to be a TA. I had two classmates who could've been an instructor immediately while being in the program. So it took an amount of opportunities from us. If we felt like the ugly [inaudible] school, we really just felt like they wanted to just throw something like [orphans?] at that point, so. That's kind of one of the reasons why it's bittersweet, but it's more sweet than bitter with the experience with school. So yeah, that's how it's been at school being eventful."
1182.0,1185.0,Interviewer,And did you always want to go into software engineering or--?
1185.0,1281.0,Subject,"I did not, actually. It just kind of-- the opportunity presented itself. No. I knew that I knew how to code. Funny enough, that's kind of the reason how I got into the program is I told them, ""I used to [dibble?] and download Myspace, and I have my Tumblr, [inaudible] update, and I can read html, and blah, blah, blah."" [inaudible] like, ""Oh, wow. Really? Okay. Well, you already have the beginnings of a coder."" And I'm like, ""Oh, really?"" So they kind of put in my head like, ""You could really do this. It's something that's seen as crazy."" When I saw the opportunity - excuse me - I also knew I wanted to get on it because my thing is it's a skill required for moving on in the future, learning the technological age [laughter] where things are only going up from there. And it's like the more technologically adept you are and just knowing of how software, of hardware works, it's just going to be better for you moving forward into the future. So I just felt like-- I like to always improve myself, so I felt like that was a perfect opportunity. So yeah, I was glad I [hopped?] into it. When I was a kid, I used to pull apart things and put them back together, so yeah. I had a little interest in tech from a while back. I kind of did fall into it, but I did enjoy the tech thing from before. Yeah, I think that's about it for that question. Yeah."
1281.0,1283.0,Interviewer,And have you thought about reaching out to [crosstalk]--
1283.0,1284.0,Subject,My friends?
1284.0,1288.0,Interviewer,--your friends from the [inaudible]?
1288.0,1648.0,Subject,"That's one thing I'm very bad with. Even though I can communicate, anyone who is my real friend knows I won't [laughter], because, for one, I don't really have anything exciting to talk about every day. And I know that we're all adults and everybody has things that they're going through. If I feel like I need to do a wellness check or anything like that, if I see anything off on social media, or LinkedIn, Facebook, whatever, [inaudible] social media. So if I see anything off, then I'll contact them; or if anybody contacts me, I'm more than willing to respond. But for me to reach out to them first, no. Not likely. And we have a Slack channel. And I kid you not, I have not opened that program purposefully for a month and a half. I know that [laughter] on Slack, they're probably hounding me. I probably have a million [laughter] direct messages like, ""Where are you?"" ""What are you doing?"" ""Are you still coding?"" ""Did you put another app on Play Store yet?"" No, no, no, no, and no. I don't want to tell them. I don't want to disappoint anyone that I'm kind of holding off on it, because they're all going to tell me, ""You can't do that."" I don't want to hear that right now. I get it. I understand what I'm doing. I saw how everybody who did that had to deal with it afterwards. I know myself. I know my limits and I have other things that I am focusing on as well, and I can't spare myself [to them?]. So I just left that Slack channel closed. When I'm ready to-- or when I'm more settled into things, once work starts and I get a little bit settled into that, then I can balance out looking at my stocks, organizing my store while I'm working again, then I would be able to have the time or the ability to contact people, and have a little more free time. But right now, I'm a little bit more business-minded. I just need to get those things done right now. I also have my parents hounding me on-- my stepfather is 79, and he's past retirement. And it sucks because he's the sole provider of my family right now. My mom lost her job two years ago. My brother's a bum. He's a moot. He lives in the house still, doesn't pay no bills. Me, I feel like I'm the same even though I'm not, because I was in school full time, and I used to work two jobs before that. But being that I was in school and I didn't have any income because I was a full-time student, I felt like, ""Oh, my God."" My parents are working hard and nobody else is there to help them when they've taken care of us our whole year. That's another thing. Being in school, it made me-- I never really had a [laughter] good relationship with my mom up until that November where I broke down from school. After that, I guess they kind of realized. It was like, ""I know you work hard. I know you work hard. I know you don't always want to put up with ignorance and bullshit, so."" Yeah, we kind of came to an understanding. And I also understood my parents do provide for me and they do care about me. I could be out on the street like a lot of people. I could be waist-high, neck-high in bills, but I'm not. Thanks to my parents. That's tangent. So moving back to-- stepfather, 79 years old, he needs to retire. My parents keep asking me about business ideas. [Senona?], that's my nickname, the idea factory. Well, I've told them. I've really advised them, and they just don't want to hear, so. And they just keep coming to me, and I'm just like, ""Well, I've already written down your business plan. I already told you what you need to do. If you want to do this, then do this. If you need to do this, then do this. If you need to do this, then do that and the third. I can't do everything for you,"" but they kind of want me to. And I kind of realized, I know that if anything was going to get done [laughter] - because I'm not a talker, I'm an action person, they're more of a talker - then I'm going to have to do it for them. So that's another thing that may - excuse me - differ my goals right now, because I do have my parents settled in a situation where they're making money without laborious work. My stepfather works in FDNY. So, yeah [laughter]. It's a lot, but that's the least of my problems. It comes with who I am. It always comes with who I am. I have to take on a lot of people's work, but it's okay. It's okay. I'm an adult and I've learned to just deal with it. Also, the reason I'm able to deal with it is because you take things one day at a time. There is no real rush. I mean, I'm 25 and I hit that quarter-life crisis is like, ""I need my life to be together right now."" But I also learned, especially with being at school, not having money, patience and realizing everything comes one day at a time. You can take care of things. Everything that you want to do can be taken care of as long as you're not worrying about everything getting done all at once, all at once. Like, ""All right. This is done. Today, I'm going to work on my business."" Okay. ""Tomorrow, probably my mom will wake me up and ask me, 'Oh, I need to open a business. What do you think about a laundromat on--?'"" ""I'll look into it for you, mom. Let's see if the building is available first, and then let's see [laughter] what we could do about getting loans and stuff like that. That I'll focus on tomorrow."" But focusing on all those things, all the things that I described to you, all in one day, it's too much. Yeah. I allocate time for everything accordingly. I try to, at least. I try my best. Did I answer the question? I think I did [laughter]."
1648.0,1653.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm. Then what sort of ideas do you recommend for your parents?
1653.0,2011.0,Subject,"Oh, man. The biggest one-- and it's going to upset me because I know they're not going to do it, and it would be the one thing that would finally-- my family would be fine. So I live right by Belmont race track, and they're actually about to build a stadium or improve the race track so that that will be home of the rangers, but I believe they're starting that construction in April, 2020. You can kind of tell when a neighborhood is experiencing an economic shift. You can see the city is doing a little bit more improvement projects around changing the streetlights, fixing the roads, fixing the sidewalks. Okay. I see you. And then there are people who are also selling their houses because they can no longer afford or they want to move. Okay. So we're having more people coming to the neighborhood. So you see that there's going to be economic shift. So there's a old car lot right on the main boulevard leading to Belmont race track, literally, if we live one block away from the Belmont border. That's where it is, on the main strip. Now, I don't believe the lot is for sale, but apparently, my stepfather does know the owner of the lot, and it would be perfect to open a business there. Starbucks."" Every day, every morning, or every weekend morning when my friend would come pick me up-- she lives in Valley Stream, but not too far. Only one exit away. Sometimes we'd be a little late because she's like, ""Sorry, [P?]. I'm running late. I had to go get my Starbucks, and you know it's quite far."" I'm like, ""I understand."" But it's true. Starbucks is really far. There are not that many Starbucks, even in Long Island, around. So I felt like Starbucks would be perfect, especially with the whole new changing up of Belmont race track and the whole stadium, people are going to want their Starbucks. When there's the race tracks, the derbies-- not the race track, the horse racing in the summer, and the whole area is congested, nobody can get food, but it will be perfect them to get Starbucks. Everybody wants Starbucks. I'm a Starbucks person. Nobody wants Dunkin' Donuts. Starbucks [laughter]. So I pitched all of these different angles. My mom is just giving me excuses, first of all, like, ""Oh, it's not a franchise."" Two, ""So it's so expensive."" ""Okay, I'll get a business loan."" Three, ""I don't have good credit."" ""Well, it's you, my stepfather, and my brother, you get who'll co-sign and you get that together."" ""Oh, but I don't know if this person's going to agree."" ""Okay."" Excuses. ""So what if you just get somebody else as a fourth contingent for contingency purposes or whatever for your signing?"" ""Oh, but--"" and that's the problem with me and my mom when it comes to planning business. For me, I don't like to hear the excuses especially when you're dealing with finance. If there is no-- it is take it or leave it when it comes to business most of the time. It's like, ""Are you going to take the jump or not?"" And if you're going to sit here idle and not jump, people are just going to walk around you and keep going, and they're going to take the opportunity before you. So I'm a little bit frustrated with her because I feel like she hasn't brought up the topic as much as she's come to me about it to my stepfather. And then the thing that's mainly stopping her from starting a business is, ""Oh. Well, the lot is not for sale."" She knows the Jewish man who owns the place-- or rather, my stepfather does. So I was like, ""Okay. Well, you know that I work in catering in [Lauryn's?] in the synagogue. What you do is you invite that man down for some coffee. Go invite him for some coffee and some Starbucks. Invite him in the house if you need to, but let him know, present to him the plan like, 'Okay. Well, I want to open a coffee shop. This is your lot. If I could either rent the lot or buy the lot from you, then that would be great.'"" Basically, present it in a professional way. I even wrote it out, how she should do it. And that's the thing. I'm putting all this effort, and it's just like it's not being put anywhere else. That's the problem when it comes to my parents, [inaudible]. But [laughter] if they could do it, then it'll be great, and then that would end a lot of my worries with them. I wouldn't have to worry about money for them. And they know that, okay, it's a big investment. And when it comes to big investments and opening a business, you're going to be in red for quite a few years. But I already told her, I was like, ""Projected you're not going to be in the red for 10 years, 5 years, this is Starbucks, one. When have you ever seen a Starbucks go under? Never, two. Three [laughter], once that stadium opens up and everything pops up, everything becomes liver on the area, that red is going to shrink and you're going to break-even a lot faster."" But they don't hear me [laughter]. They don't hear me."
