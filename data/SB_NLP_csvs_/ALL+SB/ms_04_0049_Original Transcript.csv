2.0,6.0,Interviewer,So how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,70.0,Subject,"Things have been going pretty well, honestly. Actually, let me change my chair because it's really loud. [inaudible]. I'm sorry for--I wasn't prepared, really. I'm changing the chair because I [had a Zoom in here?] [inaudible]. The chair I was using was too low. That's [cool?]. I'll [give it back?] [inaudible]. Sorry, I'm kind of, I don't know, renovating my room right now, so it's like there's a lot of stuff I had to move around."
70.0,76.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, no. No worries at all. Yeah. So you said things have been going well?"
76.0,77.0,Subject,"Yeah, for the most part."
77.0,81.0,Interviewer,So what's been going well? What's going on?
81.0,110.0,Subject,"Well, I've been, I don't know, just getting over a lot of stuff that I didn't get over that prevented me from doing productive things, I guess. And, yeah, just generally, things are going well. That's a big question. If you ask specific things, I'll be able to tell you, but I don't know. In this holisticness, I can't really just say everything that's going well."
110.0,117.0,Interviewer,All right. So what are some of the kind of challenges that you feel like you've been getting over lately?
117.0,138.0,Subject,"When I get in states where it's hard to manage stress, learning how to get to [base state?], where it's kind of stable, and a lot of learning about why I am the way I am, I guess. Yeah."
138.0,148.0,Interviewer,Good. That sounds so important. So what are some things that you've been learning in terms of what's a good way to kind of manage stress and get back to baseline?
148.0,198.0,Subject,"Well, I've been redoing my room because this room carried a lot of bad things from, I guess, previous years. So I redid my entire room. I painted all the walls, and I moved in all my furniture from downstairs because I was trying to create a space where I can-- when I sink into all the tribulations of life, I guess, I created a room where it was kind of like I could feel airy, and a space where I felt comfortable enough to just work, my creative work, and work on school without feeling dragged down as soon as I walk in. And yeah, I guess--"
198.0,203.0,Interviewer,That makes a lot of sense. The color looks great. I love it.
203.0,206.0,Subject,"I mean, I didn't get-- it's like everything different. I painted a cheetah on this one."
206.0,208.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow."
208.0,210.0,Subject,I did-- yeah.
210.0,212.0,Interviewer,That's beautiful.
212.0,213.0,Subject,Thank you.
213.0,219.0,Interviewer,"Wow. Oh, my gosh. So what are some of these creative endeavors? Is the wall one of them?"
219.0,253.0,Subject,"I mean, it's just-- yeah. I make clothes. I don't know. I'm not going to say I'm a fashion designer, but pretty amateurly, I make clothes. Less amateur now than before, but I make clothes, and I'm part of a few, I guess, creative collectives around the city. Not a few, just one. And my dream is really to be in the art industry, whether it be film or fashion. I'm pretty good at both things, so I'm confident I could do it. So--"
253.0,259.0,Interviewer,"Wow. Oh, my gosh. That's so exciting. I can't believe you make clothes. That's awesome."
259.0,260.0,Subject,"Yeah, thank you."
260.0,263.0,Interviewer,So how long have you been doing that?
263.0,266.0,Subject,"Almost three years, since I was like 15. [crosstalk]--"
266.0,273.0,Interviewer,"And is this something that you've always known that you were interested in, or how did this develop?"
273.0,361.0,Subject,"All right. So I would say maybe-- I mean, I've always been interested in arts. When I was a kid, I kind of was tricked into thinking that I was a STEM kid because I was good at school, and my parents just thought I was going to be a doctor or lawyer. But, really, what I was really interested-- I want to be an innovator because I've been an artist. That's the one thing that really tied everything together. I'm really good at drawing. I've been drawing since I was probably four years old. And then, so I would say I wanted to do animation or be in film for the longest time, either that or lawyer. And I would say probably middle school, I don't know, drawing wasn't as cool anymore, but I still appreciate the art. And what was really big at the time, like early 2010s when I was in middle school, was clothes, was fashion and shoes. And it was more streetwear, but then, progressively, how the natural chain of events goes, you get into maybe just clothes very casually, and then you get more into it. And as you get more into it, you get into the more nicher audiences. So I got into high fashion and stuff. And then, there was a community for kids [just?] like me around the city that's into cool clothes and cool music, and that's just what I got into. And I got pretty good at it, so I'm like, ""Yeah, I want to do this professionally."" [Not really?] anything I want to do."
361.0,366.0,Interviewer,"That's so amazing. I love how that trajectory just kind of took shape, you know?"
366.0,367.0,Subject,Yeah.
367.0,377.0,Interviewer,"Wow, that's so cool. So can you tell me a little bit more about this collective of other people who are like you? What has it been like to be part of that group of people?"
377.0,494.0,Subject,"Honestly, I'm probably the least involved because I'm-- I would say it's unsteady for me because there's times where I'm outside all the time with my friends, and there's times where I don't go outside and I see like two people for weeks, only two different people for weeks. But I would say probably last summer is when it really hit me that we can all really get rich or make a long-term career off of it because I guess they started-- during the time where I was kind of more agoraphobic and stayed in the house, I guess they started with their collective, and then they started-- and I was in a collective, associated with one loosely. I don't know how to say that word, but looser before. And that collective - it's like a clothing brand - they started to blow up around that time too. And then my best friend in the collective, they started to throw parties, and those parties got pretty big. During the summer, it was probably like the biggest parties in the city, not even just amongst my age group, which is what, 16 to 20? I'm saying 30-year-olds and 30-year-old celebrities were coming. I'm like, ""I didn't know we could do this,"" and they just started this year in early 2021, and they got big to the point where I didn't even think it could get that big that quickly. So it was an eye-opening moment. It's like I can either stay around and, I don't know, I guess be complacent and just go to a mediocre school and excel, or I can do what I want to do, and I decided to do what I wanted to do. It wasn't even a decision. That's what I knew I had to do since I was 15, but it was an eye-opening moment where I was like, ""Yeah, this is just what I need to do."""
494.0,501.0,Interviewer,"So maybe it helped you see how big that could really get and how possible that was, maybe."
501.0,502.0,Subject,"Yeah, for sure."
502.0,504.0,Interviewer,That's awesome. [crosstalk]--
504.0,505.75,Subject,I'm sorry. [I'm going to put?] on a hat because my hair's looking pretty--
505.75,506.0,Interviewer,Okay.
506.0,519.0,Subject,"I'm sorry. [inaudible]. I'm sorry. It was kind of hard to look at the camera because, I don't know, I was insecure--"
519.0,529.0,Interviewer,"I honestly get that. Trust me. I understand. Okay, that's [so?]. So you said your friend started that collective that became huge, right?"
529.0,535.0,Subject,"Yeah, I wouldn't say super, super huge, but it got bigger than I expected it can get [for probably a month?]. And it's--"
535.0,544.0,Interviewer,"So do you feel like there's any point in you starting your own? Would that be something you'd be wanting to do, or is it just cool to be part of this other one?"
544.0,609.0,Subject,"I mean, I wouldn't even say I'm really in-- I mean, I'm not really in that group, I would say. I'm heavily associated because the two people that really started it are my best friends, but it's just like, me personally, I'm not even a group person because, as I was saying earlier, I do have a lot of things I need to work on about myself, and just being around people is probably an overwhelming engagement. If they have expectations for me, I will feel like [inaudible] responsibility to fulfill, and I might start to see that siphon away from some of my other responsibilities as a person to myself. So, really, right now, I'm taking [inaudible] production class at Parsons, and I'm just learning as much as I can and working and designing until I can start making money off it so I can upscale and do what I really want to do."
609.0,620.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So what you really want to do, is that involve selling your clothes or having a company or a brand? What is your kind of long-term vision at this point?"
620.0,793.0,Subject,"I think I would say what you're asking is probably more short term, with selling, because realistically, I'm probably going to start selling in the next month, selling the clothes I'm making. I would say, in terms of long-term vision, so how I think it's going to play out with the plan-- I'm going to explain both, but how I think it's the plan and versus how I really think it's going to play out. Since a lot of the clothes I'm really designing I don't feel like I can produce in large scale by myself because I'm not that great of a seamster-- I really just started sewing two years ago, and very on and off, really. I was really not sewing too often. But now, I'm really going to start trying to sew probably five, six hours a day, but during that time, there's no way I can really large-scale manufacture advanced garments. So what I think I'm going to do, I'm just going to probably have it like an exclusive brand where I sell clothes in very limited quantities. I might sell a bunch of different designs, so. But the thing is, I'm going to have it synonymous with a few insignias so people can recognize it's me and then grow my name. And then once I have some of my more notable friends that have a way bigger following than me wear my clothes, I think that's going to put my name in the spotlight, and that's going to guarantee me really to-- because then, I want to use that to apply to maybe the bachelor's program at-- because right now, I'm going to Parsons but not fully enrolled. It's like an audit class pretty much. It's like I have an ID, but I didn't have to apply to get in. I just really paid and [talked to?] my other school, and I'm taking a class. But I want to be in that school for their bachelor's program in fashion design so I can get industry connects. And then, after that, I want to do my master's in Belgium. But honestly, if it's more successful than I think, then maybe I don't need to do that. But my [angle?] long-term goal, I want to be in film because that's my first passion, animation and film. Less animation now; really, just film. So I'm really going to focus on my advertising and my marketing with really cool videos, and do music videos with people wearing my clothes. And hopefully, on that way, I meet somebody that I can really just step in the film industry and still do my clothes, but I feel like that's probably the place I can make the biggest mark and really communicate my message on the world is through probably film and TV, so yeah."
793.0,802.0,Interviewer,"That's amazing. So do you feel like you have any desire to really merge your two passions long term, like clothes and film or--?"
802.0,868.0,Subject,"Definitely. Yeah, no, definitely, because I wouldn't even say those are entirely my two passions because they're just, I guess, two quadrants of my real passions, right? I would say the four quadrants-- or I'm not even going to say quadrants because it's probably a lot of different sectors, but my real passion is probably just, I don't know, anything that's just culture. I would just say culture, but anything really sociological or political, anything just really revolving people, like epistemology. That's just my stuff because what I really want to do, my message is to really have a profound-- I don't know how to explain it, but I want to show people the connection to other people in a profound way, whether that be politically, through fashion, music because it all connects a lot more than people think. I'm not saying you. It just connects a lot more than people think."
868.0,890.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that’s such a good message. That’s awesome, honestly. I think you’re so right. I think so many people don’t see the way that all these people’s experiences and the importance of connecting with other people really relate to the ultimate experience in the world - right? - and people’s lives. So I think that’s wonderful. Yeah."
890.0,916.0,Subject,"And if people are more willing to understand that, then people are going to be way more, I feel like, understanding of people and-- I don’t know. That’s my goal. It sounds pretentious, and I could actually made it sound a little more pretentious, but I’m going to say, generally, I feel like-- I don’t know. I think I could-- no, I know I could do it. I just need to work a lot harder, [honestly?]."
916.0,928.75,Interviewer,"I mean, that’s like 90% of the battle, I feel like, is being able to recognize that this is in your skillset and this is something that you want to do and you’re willing to work for. I mean, I feel like that’s everything. So what--?"
928.75,929.0,Subject,"Yeah, [crosstalk]."
929.0,950.0,Interviewer,"What is it that you want people to really know about you? Is there anything that you would want people to-- when you have a bigger following or when people start to recognize your brand or your insignia, what do you want people to think about?"
950.0,1002.0,Subject,"I mean, honestly, I want people to see what they like in me and be able to [digestibly?] understand why they like it in me and see [it?] in themselves. Because it’s not even about me because, really, I’m everybody else and everyone else is me. That sounds like, I don’t know, a psychedelic thought, but no. I mean, in the aspect that-- I don’t know. That’s just my plan, having people understand the fact that-- I need to be able to articulate this better because I didn’t even coherently lead up to this. I don’t know. I need to go back a little bit [crosstalk]--"
1002.0,1008.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, take your time. Go back. I mean, we have plenty of time, so."
1008.0,1058.0,Subject,"It’s like I want people to be reminded of just the good and the bad in their-- not even the bad because I don’t actually believe in any intrinsic value in terms of good and bad. I feel like it’s like I want people to just recognize things in their life and the role it plays, whether it’s-- and I don’t think it’s ever truly really good or necessarily bad because I feel like there’s plus and positives. I’m going to give an example. That’s what I really should’ve done. So I want people to-- all right, so say, really, my main goal, the main work of what I want to do-- I don’t know if you’ve seen The Wire, it’s the HBO show that came out [several years ago?]."
1058.0,1060.0,Interviewer,"I haven’t seen it, but I’ve heard of it."
1060.0,1120.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I want to-- I guess I want to make a show similar to that in terms of how it’s structured because it’s a show about the Black condition and how it relates to everybody in the city of Baltimore. But I want to make it that for New York City, and I guess less focus on the present industrial system, I guess more focused on the culture and how it affects people more interpersonally and I guess more social understanding of the Black condition and how it affects everybody around us, right? And a lot of the things that people might see that at least I saw was bad in myself or bad in other people, or good in other people, it’s really out of our control. And if we understand these differences-- not even differences. If we understand, I guess, differences and similarities, we could put more reason behind our action, I guess. I don’t know."
1120.0,1136.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, definitely. Would you be willing to share with me an example that you’ve been thinking about in terms of your experience that you feel like kind of highlights maybe these differences or similarities that you’re talking about?"
1136.0,1155.0,Subject,"Yeah. All right. I would say, from a more macro level, I don’t know-- what was I going to say? What I was going to say-- I knew what I was going to say. I need to remember it."
1155.0,1164.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, take your time."
1164.0,1165.0,Subject,What was I going to say? [crosstalk]--
1165.0,1180.0,Interviewer,"We were talking about-- here, let me just-- let’s take one step back. So we were talking about the experience of Black kind of culture in America and how you wanted to make a New York City version of The Wire."
1180.0,1256.0,Subject,"Okay. Okay, yeah. I remember what I was going to say. So I would say our understanding of how, I don’t know, people exist in America, I guess, probably takes place from-- it’s probably more monolithic. Our scale of good to bad or the scale of morality is applied to everybody on the same scale, which is probably the White scale. And to have more understanding that people that come from different areas or come from just different understandings of life, it’s not the same scale. So if people put more understanding that people really develop the same way if they have certain experience or if they’re trained to process different things, they’re really going to come to the same conclusion you are if you’ve experienced the same thing because we’re really just not that different. The experience is what-- and our genes, too, but. I need to write this down because it’s not coming out as coherently as I expected it because this is, honestly, just a lot of stuff that’s just been in my head, and I haven’t really written it down in cohesive language yet. It’s just like in my type of [inaudible], I don't know."
1256.0,1300.0,Interviewer,"No, I totally know that feeling of just thinking about something and having it feel really in there in my head and then explaining it and not feeling like I’m doing as good of a job, but I really feel like you are conveying-- at least to me, it seems clear what you’re saying, and I get your message, and I think it’s just so valuable. I think what I’m hearing you say is, people are basically people, and if you put two different people in the same set of circumstances, then they’ll probably react the same way, but the reality is that, at this time, people are not necessarily in the same circumstances, but they’re being measured on the same scale. And so that’s--"
1300.0,1302.0,Subject,"Yeah, that’s true. That’s pretty much what I’m saying, yeah."
1302.0,1306.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, so I think you’re doing a great job."
1306.0,1344.0,Subject,"Yeah. And then, on the social aspect, I wanted to show how it relates to the music we listen to, the clothes we wear, and the books we read, and the movies we watch. I don’t know. There’s a lot more nuance to it, definitely, and I have probably 10 years until I even get to the point where I can really be in, I don't know, an HBO or an FX writing room, but we’ll see. And, honestly, I think the route from fashion to film is a route that not many people have really taken before, so we’ll see."
1344.0,1352.0,Interviewer,"I think it has to do with how you connect all of these various aspects of culture, though, and how you see them all as part of one."
1352.0,1362.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely. That’s really what it is. Music, fashion, film, everything, it’s all really comes from the same place."
1362.0,1387.0,Interviewer,"So what do you think all these different people with all these different experiences-- what type of music should people have more exposure to, or what types of books do you feel like are under-read? What do you think needs to be brought out into this collective space in terms of culture?"
1387.0,1509.0,Subject,"Honestly, I don’t think-- really, I don’t think it’s really a necessity for-- because, all right, my big thing is that I don’t really feel like we should really put responsibility on the people because if the system that we’re set up-- the institution that we were, I guess, indoctrinated-- I don’t want to say that because that just sounds like-- that just sounds like, I don’t know - what’s the word? - a word that’s really big right now. I don’t know. The institution we’re in, I don’t really want to blame it on general people because most people, it’s not really their fault. They’re just a product of what they’ve come up in. So if you play somebody from the South rap music from New York, they’re probably going to not think [good people?] about the people that’s rapping. But, realistically, they’re just rapping about their experience. And depending how old they are, they probably wouldn’t never even understand, but I don’t blame them for really being, I guess, racist. I feel like that’s dumb to really call the average person that-- they’re just speaking their truth just like how everybody else is speaking their truth. I kind of want it to be more-- so I don’t really expect everybody to just, like, “Oh, you need to read this book or watch this movie,” because I don’t expect everyone to really just get it immediately. I feel like I want-- I want this to be more on a systematic level where I can get into-- where I move somebody higher up so there can be systematic change in the way that we educate our kids and the way that, I don’t know, the media is. I don’t really think that’s going to happen because it doesn’t align with how the country works, but I don’t know. Yeah."
1509.0,1534.0,Interviewer,"Well, maybe, just tying in what you were saying earlier, though, that being able to create film or this Wire-like show that exposes people to this different reality for other people, maybe that’s a more accessible way of being introduced to this alternative culture versus reading a book or something."
1534.0,1553.75,Subject,"I mean, that’s a good-- that’s also part of my intention, to really show that people are willing to learn. Because I know there’s going to be a bunch of people [willing to learn?], but I feel like more my goal is probably on a larger scale because I want to - I don’t know - I’m not saying run for president, but I want to--"
1553.75,1554.0,Interviewer,"Hey, why not?"
1554.0,1559.0,Subject,"--maybe influence the next president, maybe. Or maybe I’ll run for president. I don’t know. We’ll see."
1559.0,1562.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Why not?
1562.0,1618.0,Subject,"I don’t know, but yeah. I think I need to really think about it more because, honestly, I mean, there’s a lot more nuance to my idea because-- but honestly, these are not new ideas at all. I feel like most people that are remotely educated, they’re familiar with these ideas, but-- and it’s just the way that things are the way they are, it’s not really because of them; it’s because if things were like that, then it just wouldn’t work in how our system’s set up. I get that, but I don’t know. I feel like I’m good at explaining things, and I have a pretty clear vision, just generally, and insight when it comes to making people understand things. So maybe I can do something."
1618.0,1638.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, definitely. I mean, it’s one thing to be familiar with this and be an educated person who is intellectually aware of the situation, but I think it’s different to be somebody who has such a clear vision and such a clear passion and such a clear desire to put in the work. I think that’s just a completely different level, and I don’t think that that’s very common, and I think that--"
1638.0,1639.0,Subject,"Yeah, [inaudible]."
1639.0,1648.0,Interviewer,"--that’s the type of focus and clear view that really can make systemic change, in my opinion."
1648.0,1653.0,Subject,"Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, I think so too. Thank you."
1653.0,1676.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, of course. And so just, sorry, zooming back into the fashion a little, since that’s kind of the current project, you mentioned some of your friends have a bigger following than you do. Is social media a big way for you to kind of get yourself out there? Are you taking any steps in that domain?"
1676.0,1716.0,Subject,"Honestly, I should be a lot more. Honestly, I really should be. I really should’ve been doing it a lot more than I have in the past few years, taking advantage of the fact that, I don’t know, I was a kid that dressed really cool, and people really liked me for that reason, but I never wanted to be on social media because it made me really anxious and paranoid, and I didn’t like the attention. But now, it’s really a requirement, and I just have to get over it because that’s how you-- unless you want to do things traditionally, which I don’t really have 10 years to try to get rich, that’s really the path I’m going to have to take, I guess."
1716.0,1739.0,Interviewer,"Do you think that there’s a way that you could kind of expand a social media profile without it necessarily feeling as personal in terms of attention? Maybe if you have just your brand, and you’re kind of putting it on other people, and they’re walking around with it, is there a way that that could feel less [anxiety?] [crosstalk]?"
1739.0,1792.0,Subject,"[I don’t know?]. Oh, my fault for interrupting, but I feel like that just doesn’t work on my brand because my whole brand is, it’s kind of like taking back, I guess, subcultures and aesthetics that larger conglomerates took from those cultures or took from those people and giving it back in a more authentic package and a more nostalgic package. I think I kind of need to be the face of it. I mean, my page is not going to be just me wearing the clothes, but it’s like just how things are going to work for me. It has to be personal. My face has to be there. And it’s kind of what I want too. I want to be famous. I’ve dreamed about that [being?] since I was a kid. I’m not going to lie about that, I guess. [crosstalk]."
1792.0,1802.0,Interviewer,"Yes. Okay, so that makes sense. So that is something that you really want to work on and that you really want to kind of push yourself in that area, then."
1802.0,1812.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely. But I mean, yeah, just right now, I need to, yeah, just get less anxious and stuff. Yeah."
1812.0,1828.0,Interviewer,"[Do you?] feel like there are ways that maybe you could-- basically, what are some ways that you think you could navigate de-escalating yourself from feeling those kind of anxious thoughts around getting more visibility?"
1828.0,1870.0,Subject,"Really, I’ve been trying to figure out why I feel anxious, why I feel anxiety amongst, I guess, people my age taking issue to my success, and worrying about potential extortion or problems I may have in the future as I get more known. And, realistically, it’s so frivolous to just worry about that shit when it has nothing to do with my life now. That’s just how I’ve been since a kid, just generally anxious about those type of things, about conflict. I’ve been kind of conflict-averse in that sense. And I don’t really want to be anymore."
1870.0,1897.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, in some ways, it’s just so natural because I think, especially with your brand being such a kind of niche, personal reflection of taking back these culture aspects and putting that back out there and repackaging it, as you said, that is personal, right? So it is a vulnerable act, but I think that vulnerable act is also courageous."
1897.0,1991.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I’m not going to say I’m completely scary and fearful because I think I’m a lot braver in a lot of aspects than most people. But what I would say where the anxiety probably stems from in a more surface level is like, okay, I mean, just different scenarios where, one, people see that I’m getting successful and rich and famous, and they recognize me from middle school or high school, and they just want to get points on social media for trying to do something [to me?]. That is a real threat, but realistically, I probably won’t have to worry about that, honestly. I don’t even know. Or maybe with girls in my life, they have pasts, and somebody just-- there’s a jealous ex, and I might just get mad. But I’m not even really like that in terms of-- I don’t know. Just people see things on social media and take it to extent, and I think that’s just a natural-- I think that’s just a natural conclusion to how social media does. It makes people a lot more tied to that world, and they bring it into the real world and take things a lot more seriously than it has to be. And me, I’m not really someone that takes things seriously, I guess, like that’s everything. And people might just get mad at me for just stuff that I don’t really care about, and now I have to deal with people and problems I don’t really care about and stuff."
1991.0,2031.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I think all of the influencers in the world at some point have mentioned that they get a lot of flak or that they get a lot of negative kickback. But it seems, at least, that there’s so many people still doing it that the positive tends to outweigh the negative and that you do also get this influx of positivity and support and a community, and the negative stuff just starts-- I think it makes a lot of sense to be nervous about that and anxious about that before you’re really there, but I think it seems that maybe when you’re there, all those negative things will seem smaller, and you’ll kind of get used to just brushing them off more than maybe you would in your everyday life."
2031.0,2085.0,Subject,"Yeah, that's 100% true. I’ve really been a person my entire life to really view their problems or their potential problems as bigger than [entire life?]. That may be just the teenage position or-- I don’t know. I think I'm a mature [inaudible], but it’s prevented me in the past because, I don’t know, I’ve had issues with people that I don’t even know. Not really real issues, just people I don’t know saying things about me. I don’t know. I don’t know. I just want to avoid that because [that there?] is real, fact that, just being from this city, people are probably more inclined to be violent or try to rob you or-- I don’t know. I really shouldn’t worry about that, but it’s just still on my mind."
2085.0,2097.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, definitely. And maybe just taking from some of the stuff that you said earlier on, if you think about it as each of these people is really going through their own struggle--"
2097.0,2100.0,Subject,That's true. That's 100% true. That's the best-- thank you. I appreciate that.
2100.0,2100.75,Interviewer,You know?
2100.75,2101.0,Subject,Yeah.
2101.0,2106.0,Interviewer,"So yeah, I think that you said that. I’m just echoing your words, but."
2106.0,2126.0,Subject,"Yeah, no. I’m glad you made that connection, though, because that’s what made me feel better anytime I’m worried about that. Because if you really personify somebody or humanize somebody, that’s the way to make anybody not a threat at all because you just know this is just their natural response to whatever they’re going through."
2126.0,2131.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Exactly. All right. If it’s okay with you, I’ll actually stop the recording now."
2131.0,2132.0,Subject,All right.
