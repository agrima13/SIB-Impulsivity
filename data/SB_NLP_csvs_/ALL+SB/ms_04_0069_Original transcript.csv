3.0,7.0,Interviewer,So how have things been going for you lately?
7.0,26.0,Subject,"Pretty much not doing much at home. Usually, I'm just chilling at home. I've tried monitoring myself to see if I've been fine some days."
26.0,31.0,Interviewer,So what does monitoring yourself look like for you?
31.0,37.0,Subject,"Just being aware, trying to be present."
37.0,46.0,Interviewer,And does that help you-- what does that help you feel when you're more aware of what's going on? How does that help you?
46.0,49.0,Subject,I don't know.
49.0,62.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So you've said you've been doing the same kind of not doing too much. In your free time, have you been doing any activities or anything like that?"
62.0,78.0,Subject,"No, just at home on my phone. I don't know. For the past two days, I wake up and I feel like I should be doing something, something productive."
78.0,87.0,Interviewer,"So when you feel that way, have you been able to initiate doing something, or is that more of a thought process?"
87.0,90.0,Subject,More of a thought process.
90.0,99.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And so how would you like your days to go? If you could script an ideal day, what would it look like?"
99.0,106.0,Subject,I guess going to work and then coming back home.
106.0,110.0,Interviewer,So how has your work been going?
110.0,119.0,Subject,"Actually, I don't work right now. I used to be a home health aid to my grandma, but she got injured."
119.0,121.0,Interviewer,"Oh, no. What happened?"
121.0,124.0,Subject,Yeah. She fell.
124.0,127.0,Interviewer,Is she okay?
127.0,128.0,Subject,Yeah.
128.0,141.0,Interviewer,Okay. That's great. So has it been difficult for you to transition from previously being a home health aid to now not being a home health aid?
141.0,152.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's been difficult. I'm trying to look for jobs, and I got this internship program on the 15th."
152.0,153.0,Interviewer,That's exciting.
153.0,159.0,Subject,"Yeah. I want to start already, but I'm also kind of anxious."
159.0,167.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I get that. So when you start, what will you be doing?"
167.0,194.0,Subject,"On the job description, it said culinary. I found it on Indeed, and then it mentioned to call them directly. And it's internship program, on Indeed it said for culinary, medical assistant, and customer service."
194.0,200.0,Interviewer,So do you have a sense of what your day-to-day would look like during that internship?
200.0,204.0,Subject,"No, not yet."
204.0,210.0,Interviewer,Okay. Is there anything that you may be looking forward to about it?
210.0,222.0,Subject,"Well, reading the job description, it got me motivated, yeah."
222.0,234.0,Interviewer,That's great. So you mentioned that you're also feeling a little bit anxious about it. What do you think is contributing to that?
234.0,273.0,Subject,"Well, in the past, I was doing the same program, something similar, and I didn't really show up. And I found notes on my phone of around that time, and I wrote something that like, ""How can I want to improve myself when I don't even care about myself?"" Like I don't like myself. And so I just didn't continue with the program. I was nervous."
273.0,278.0,Interviewer,So how did you feel when you found that note?
278.0,290.0,Subject,"Well, I was looking back at almost all my notes and I didn't like what I was seeing because it was just being negative."
290.0,299.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That makes sense. So is there something that you were able to take away from that experience of looking through all of them?
299.0,301.0,Subject,I don't know.
301.0,320.0,Interviewer,"That's okay. Maybe if you would be willing to say a little bit more about how you think that this internship will positively affect you, that would be interesting to hear too."
320.0,339.0,Subject,"I don't know. It's just the job description just really got me motivated. It was just like, ""Are you looking to enhance or develop skills?"" And based on the description, it seemed like it'll help."
339.0,350.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Definitely. It sounds like it. So what skills do you think that you'll be able to develop over the course of this internship?
350.0,360.0,Subject,I don't know. But hearing about skills makes me dread because I don't know what skills I have.
360.0,363.0,Interviewer,"But that's okay because you're going to be developing new skills, right?"
363.0,364.0,Subject,Yeah.
364.0,381.0,Interviewer,"So that's exciting. So maybe thinking about kind of customer service things in general, what do you think are some skills that you might develop if you were doing customer service work?"
381.0,383.0,Subject,Maybe being kind.
383.0,388.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Totally. Anything else?
388.0,390.0,Subject,"No, I can't think of anything else."
390.0,400.0,Interviewer,So what was the process that you went through in order to find this job and apply and all that?
400.0,429.0,Subject,"Like I said, I just found in on Indeed. I don't know. I just feel like it's a perfect program. And I actually went because there was an intake appointment. I don't know. I felt anxious as well, stuck. I was just signing-- I mean, just filling out papers and I was anxious, felt stuck, didn't know what to do."
429.0,435.0,Interviewer,"So when you say stuck, what do you exactly mean by that?"
435.0,439.0,Subject,"Being nervous, don't know what to do."
439.0,454.0,Interviewer,So are there any maybe things that you're saying to yourself or that you're thinking about that might help you work through that if you're in that situation again?
454.0,458.0,Subject,Maybe ask for help.
458.0,483.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That sounds like a great idea. And I think it sounds really positive that you're thinking through how you were feeling and maybe what you could do about it. Was your family involved at all, or how has your family maybe been supporting you in this process?"
483.0,489.0,Subject,"Well, they think that I should go for it, that it could be could good."
489.0,505.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's great. And is there anybody in your life either in your family or elsewhere who really inspires you?
505.0,531.0,Subject,"No, not really. I'm dating someone, and we [didn't?] talk all day yesterday on texting. And we text on Snap and get the little notification that they're going to message you or whatever. I don't know. I felt motivated just by them doing that."
531.0,538.0,Interviewer,That's wonderful. So how did you meet this person?
538.0,545.0,Subject,"We met online, still have yet to see each other."
545.0,546.0,Interviewer,That's exciting.
546.0,547.0,Subject,Yeah.
547.0,555.0,Interviewer,"So is that in your plans, or how are you planning on going about this whole relationship?"
555.0,558.0,Subject,I don't know.
558.0,569.0,Interviewer,"That was a big question, maybe. So what are some things that you like about your partner?"
569.0,574.0,Subject,"I don't know. We have yet to see each other, so."
574.0,580.0,Interviewer,But you said that it makes you feel motivated when you see that little message pop up.
580.0,588.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't know. Just having someone to be there, I guess, makes me feel good."
588.0,607.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Definitely. So what type of positive influence do you feel is contributing to your desire to find this job and have that routine?
607.0,610.0,Subject,I don't know.
610.0,627.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So you mentioned that you're not doing necessarily that many spare-time activities right now. But in the time in your life where you were doing more spare-time activities, what were some activities that you enjoyed to do?"
627.0,630.0,Subject,Playing video games.
630.0,631.0,Interviewer,Cool. Which?
631.0,641.0,Subject,"I don't know. Right now, I don't really have a desire to play. It feels like a chore."
641.0,648.0,Interviewer,"So when you did enjoy them, which games did you like to play?"
648.0,653.0,Subject,"I guess Call of Duty, Spider-Man."
653.0,660.0,Interviewer,"Fun. And did you play those by yourself? I don't know those games, so."
660.0,662.0,Subject,Yeah. By myself.
662.0,673.0,Interviewer,Fun. And were there any other activities that you kind of enjoy trying?
673.0,674.0,Subject,No.
674.0,684.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And how about any of your friends, do you feel that you feel close to any people right now?"
684.0,685.0,Subject,No.
685.0,702.0,Interviewer,Okay. And what's something that you in general like to discuss with people? What is a topic that you feel is really interesting or exciting?
702.0,706.0,Subject,I don't know. I don't really talk to people that much.
706.0,721.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Well, what about you mentioned that your dad is outside and he's waiting for you. On the way back home, let's say, what might you and your dad talk about?"
721.0,745.0,Subject,I was thinking about telling him about I'm anxious for tomorrow seeing my psychiatrist. And I don't know. I feel like it's kind of a hassle just to travel to do appointments. And maybe mentioning that I kind of don't want to do therapy and seeing my psychiatrist.
745.0,752.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what is contributing to it feeling like a hassle for you?
752.0,753.0,Subject,Traveling.
753.0,773.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That makes sense. So yeah, you mentioned that you're feeling a bit anxious about your appointment tomorrow. Could you say a little bit more about maybe why or what's contributing to that?"
773.0,783.0,Subject,"Feeling the same thing, right now, I feel kind of awkward, don't know what to talk about."
783.0,788.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's okay. It's my job to keep the conversation going, not yours. So no worries about that."
788.0,800.0,Subject,Yeah. I don't know. I don't know what to say. I keep saying I don't know and just shrugging my shoulders.
800.0,835.0,Interviewer,"That's okay, really. This is just very informal, just some thoughts if you have any on the top of your head about any of these topics, but nothing that you have say anything about if they're not coming to mind. So no worries about that at all. Oh, so you did mention that you were maybe a little bit nervous. Maybe we could kind of practice a little bit or talk about what you might talk about with your dad so you can maybe think about these things and have a really-- maybe so that you don't feel that way when you're talking with him."
835.0,837.0,Subject,"Who, my dad?"
837.0,855.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So when you're saying that you're a little bit anxious or nervous for this appointment, that it's a hassle, what other feelings do you have about maybe your appointment with your therapist or your psychiatrist?"
855.0,874.0,Subject,"I guess despair. That's what comes to mind. I don't know. I don't know. Last appointment was awkward, like I said, don't know what to talk about."
874.0,887.0,Interviewer,"So do you feel like you wish that he or she would maybe take the lead more in terms of the conversations, or--?"
887.0,894.0,Subject,I guess. I don't know. I don't know what to talk about.
894.0,911.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So do you feel that if somebody kind of directed the conversation more it would help you in terms of thinking about different topics rather than you may be generating them independently?
911.0,913.0,Subject,Maybe. Yeah.
913.0,929.0,Interviewer,Okay. So maybe that's something that you could bring up to either your therapist or your psychiatrist - I don't know - just so that they kind of understand where you're coming from and how you're feeling.
929.0,931.0,Subject,Yeah.
931.0,942.0,Interviewer,So what else do you feel could be improved with your experience with your mental health professionals?
942.0,943.0,Subject,Say that again?
943.0,953.0,Interviewer,What other things do you feel could be improved with your therapist or your psychiatrist?
953.0,956.0,Subject,I don't know. I'm not sure.
956.0,969.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Well, when you said that you felt like it was awkward, is there anything that would help that situation feel less awkward?"
969.0,972.0,Subject,"No, I don't think so."
972.0,982.0,Interviewer,Okay. Okay. That makes sense. So we don't have too much more time so maybe just a couple more minutes if you have.
982.0,983.0,Subject,Yeah. That's okay.
983.0,991.0,Interviewer,So how do you feel your relationship is with your dad right now?
991.0,1016.0,Subject,"It's okay. Usually, I feel like-- I don't know. I just like being around with him. I don't want to be alone. But it is also hard to chat with him because I feel like he doesn't really understand."
1016.0,1023.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What is it that you would like him to understand a little bit more?
1023.0,1028.0,Subject,I don't know.
1028.0,1048.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Well, when you say that you enjoy being around him, do you know what it is that makes you feel like it's really nice to be around him? Is he maybe really-- maybe what is he like that makes you feel that way?"
1048.0,1055.0,Subject,I don't know. I feel the need just to be around him because I don't want to be alone.
1055.0,1062.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So what is your dad like? If you had to describe him to somebody and say, ""Oh, this is what my dad is like,"" how would you describe him?"
1062.0,1085.0,Subject,"He's kind of goofy sometimes. Usually, the people that he hangs around with knows-- they usually say for me to just watch after him to take care of him, make sure he's okay. But sometimes, I feel like that about myself for him to do that to me."
1085.0,1092.0,Interviewer,So why do you feel like his friends say that you should take care of him?
1092.0,1101.0,Subject,"Because usually, a lot of people say he's a good person."
1101.0,1123.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Sounds like it. Goofiness is such a good trait. So you mentioned that your grandma had a little bit of an accident in terms of falling. How is she doing emotionally at this point?
1123.0,1135.0,Subject,"I feel like she'd be lost. I'd be lost as well. But I don't know if she's been walking, so. She has to do therapy."
1135.0,1152.0,Interviewer,"So when you that she's lost, is there anything that is specifically she feels lost or anything that she could do to kind of help that?"
1152.0,1173.0,Subject,I don't know. I feel like she just doesn't understand certain things. I don't know. And I kind of don't like going to see her because it's like I don't know what to do. Yeah. But I do want her back at home because it just felt better.
1173.0,1176.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So is she not at home right now?
1176.0,1177.0,Subject,No.
1177.0,1184.0,Interviewer,Okay. And how does she feel about not being home? Do you have any idea?
1184.0,1186.0,Subject,No.
1186.0,1199.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Well, hopefully, that she's able to come back and you guys can all kind of go back to being together more. It sounded like you guys had a really nice dynamic."
1199.0,1204.0,Subject,Yeah. Sort of. I'm her favorite person.
1204.0,1205.0,Interviewer,You are?
1205.0,1206.0,Subject,Yeah.
1206.0,1212.0,Interviewer,So what do you mean when you say sort of?
1212.0,1220.0,Subject,I don't know. It just sort of--
1220.0,1229.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me about this. I don't want to take too much more of your time, so I'll stop the recording if that's okay."
1229.0,1230.0,Subject,We can continue.
1230.0,1232.0,Interviewer,You can?
1232.0,1233.0,Subject,Yeah.
1233.0,1236.0,Interviewer,Okay. I just didn't want to keep your dad waiting.
1236.0,1238.0,Subject,"I didn't want him to wait either, [I guess?]."
1238.0,1242.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. No, it's okay. We can finish now, really. You did a great job."
1242.0,1243.0,Subject,I did a great job?
1243.0,1245.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1245.0,1247.0,Subject,How?
1247.0,1255.0,Interviewer,"Because you participated and you thought about my questions. And even if you didn't have all the answers, you still did a good job, really."
1255.0,1257.0,Subject,I don't think I did a good job.
1257.0,1264.0,Interviewer,"But you did. I'm the one who decides. [laughter] I'm telling you. I'm going to stop the recording, okay?"
