2.0,6.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,21.0,Subject,"It's been going. School is pretty stressful right now. I'm not feeling so well. So yeah, I'm just taking it one day at a time, honestly."
21.0,25.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what's been stressful about school?
25.0,44.0,Subject,"The classes, the courses I'm taking, they're a lot harder than I'm used of. So it's a lot of reading and writing, and that was not really my strong suit, so."
44.0,52.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Have you been taking any steps to kind of deal with this day to day?
52.0,95.0,Subject,"Time management really. I plan out what assignment I'm going to do first, and then save my favorite for last because I spend more time on that. Just prioritizing my time, especially since I also work on campus, and then that job requires me to plan events for residents. And I just got a second job on campus and I'm trying to get that in motion. So it's a lot."
95.0,113.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that sounds like a lot. So what has it been like to juggle the two jobs and school? I know you said stressful. But kind of day to day, how has that been for you?"
113.0,156.0,Subject,"I'm just hoping it gets easy, honestly. There's people here on campus that really help, like friends. Also, knowing people is really a benefit. So try to make sure everything is okay. It helps things run smoothly just getting connected with different people, so. The more people I talk to and the more people I meet up with, it makes things easier because then we'll be struggling together. It makes it less stressful. [laughter]"
156.0,163.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. So what is your kind of social situation right now at school?"
163.0,191.0,Subject,"Everyone, in one way or another, knows me or knows of me. [laughter] And it's a blessing and a curse, the way I see it. I'm a very sociable person, a very approachable person. So it can be a good and bad thing depending--"
191.0,194.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by that?
194.0,248.0,Subject,"Drama. I go to a relatively small school, so everyone knows everyone in some way. I'm also [already on campus?]. And I'm a third year. So everyone either knows me or knows of me. So there's not a day where I'm walking on campus and someone doesn't say hi to me, or I get sidetracked on my way to class and have like a five-minute conversation with someone and be late, so. Yeah. And then the drama. There's always drama, some way, one way or another, so. Yeah."
248.0,259.0,Interviewer,"So you're saying the good part is that you know so many people, and the bad part is just the drama and the time maybe that's involved in it?"
259.0,313.0,Subject,"Yeah, because it's also like I was never really the type that everyone knew me. When I was younger, I was very quiet and shy. Excuse me. And I don't like my name on people's mouth, so. I don't know. That all changed, my first year. My first two weeks of being on campus, everyone already knew who I was because of the people I knew and they knew people; and they were already talking about me to them like, ""So my friend, [Hennessy?] comes down,"" like, ""They're cool vibes."" And then when I came down here, [they really had?]. So many people were like, ""Oh, you're the famous [Hennessy?]."" And I'm like, ""Yeah."" It's a blessing and a curse. So [inaudible]."
313.0,325.0,Interviewer,So what has that been like for you going from kind of not necessarily being in the spotlight socially to now being the spotlight?
325.0,401.0,Subject,"I don't know. It wasn't until I hit high school that I really got out my shell. I joined anything I can possibly join. That's when I was introduced to sports and dance and step. I was in my school choir. And I went to a small high school with probably like, I'm going to say, less than 400 students. So maybe 300. So I was always the student that was not leaving school till like 6, 7 o'clock because of practice; or in the teacher lounge talking to the teachers for hours, helping them out. I was never home in high school. I came to college, and it kind of just came with me, that being open and that social butterfly. It kind of just stuck."
401.0,411.0,Interviewer,"So you're saying that in high school, that's kind of where it started to change. What do you think contributed to that change from middle school to high school, let's say?"
411.0,439.0,Subject,"I finally came to turns of who I am as a person. I came out as gay my first year, my freshman year of high school. And then I found my group of friends, and we're still friends to this day. I go to school here on campus with one of my best friends that is like a sister. And yeah."
439.0,454.0,Interviewer,That's awesome. That's awesome. That's so great. Yeah. So what was that process like for you in terms of figuring out who you were and finding those people? What was that like for you?
454.0,537.0,Subject,"It was scary because I really didn't know what I was feeling until-- and I went to a Catholic high school. So it was kind of like, ""Oh,"" like, ""how would they feel about that?"" Because going to a small high school meant that even the teachers knew the gossip. They knew who was dating, who was [inaudible] each other, who was doing something. And my group of friends, they help me-- I have a friend who is transgender. And at the time, our first year, they were just gay. And so we grew together and it was-- no one was alone, so it was really helpful. It wasn't as scary because I had a support system at school. And then I had told my cousin. And when it came time that I was ready to tell my mom, he was by my side and it made it easier, so. I was never alone, which made it less scary."
537.0,555.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's great. And so how did the whole Catholic high school thing end up playing out in terms of this kind of moment for you? I totally see why that would be something that was on your mind, but how did it end up playing out?"
555.0,625.0,Subject,"Really well. My school was very supportive. Our junior year, they-- that's when my friend came out as transgender, and he went to the school and told them. And because of him, now the bathrooms are non-gender. We had a Gay Straight Alliance Club. They brought in speakers to come talk to us, and we were there to witness everything as he transitioned. And it was just like the school took it very well. The principal had meetings with the teachers letting them know like, ""Hey, this is change that's going on."" So it was really helpful.  For Pride Month, they always celebrated. They would give out little pride buttons to everyone, so. I was happy that I went to a school that was so accepting."
625.0,636.0,Interviewer,"That's fantastic. Yeah. I'm so glad to hear that. That's great. So it sounds like your friend made a really big impact not only on you, but also on kind of the school overall."
636.0,637.0,Subject,Yeah.
637.0,652.0,Interviewer,Wow. So how did you go about finding such a great support system of people who you could relate to in that sense while you were still navigating your own identity?
652.0,702.0,Subject,"Honestly, I don't like to think it as I found them. I think it like we found each other. Because there were so many times where we all felt alone, but-- we all had our-- we all have been through hell and back literally. We've all been through the same situation, but in different ways. If that makes sense. And we were all there for each other to pick us back up. And so they are my second-- they're my second family. We can go months without talking and then link up back at home, and it's like we were never apart."
702.0,727.0,Interviewer,"That's so important. Yeah, that's awesome. So how have you felt in terms of the relationships that you've made in school now relative to those friendships? Do you feel like they sustain you in the same way? I know you talked about the drama. How do you feel about your social situation now? Does it sustain you kind of socially?"
727.0,818.0,Subject,"I kind of like try to stay away from it. I didn't come here to make friends. I came here to get a education and do what I have to do, and go back home. So I've lost so many friends from my first year to now. Recently, I just lost a really close friendship. My friend group is just-- contains my girlfriend and three other people. And I am okay with that. My best friend that I came here with from high school, we would literally be talking about it, like how we thought that the people we thought were going to be our friends all four years ended up being-- we ended up having to cut them off because they were so toxic. And so we were like, ""As long as we're honest and truthful with each other, it doesn't really--"" we didn't come here to make friends. So I tend to stay away from the drama and the he said, she said nonsense because I don't have time for that. I'm a junior. [laughter] It's [crunch?] time now. [laughter]"
818.0,833.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So what was that like for you to lose that close friend? I know you're saying that it was kind of necessary and important. But emotionally, what was that like for you given that they were a close friend?"
833.0,882.0,Subject,"It sucked because to this day, we still haven't really spoke about it. And I don't necessarily want to be friends with that person, but I kind of want to clear the air because it's kind of awkward. Because we do go to the same school and we do see each other around campus and not say anything kind of like, ""Okay. So, um."" I kind of want to clear the air. And I always have respect for that person, but as far as being friends with him again, I don't think so. I didn't like the way things left off, if that makes sense."
882.0,895.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. So you mentioned junior year - that's big - that you're there to study. Do you have kind of future plans for yourself that you feel like you're working towards?"
895.0,923.0,Subject,"Honestly, I just know that I want to work with cameras. But there's a lot that plays into that: there's film, there's photography, there's production. And so it's kind of like what to pick. [laughter] So I'm just-- one day at a time."
923.0,933.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So one thing at a time, but what do you feel like you're doing right now that's kind of helping you figure that out?"
933.0,971.0,Subject,"I'm currently taking a screenwriting class, and I love it. I didn't think I would like writing scripts. It would have never been-- I would have never thought about that, but it really opens up-- it makes you start thinking a lot like creativity and imagination. Anything can happen on these papers. So I really enjoy that class."
971.0,1002.0,Interviewer,"Well, that's very [inaudible] to think about. So I guess moving a little bit away from your school situation and the social stuff, you mentioned earlier in high school, you were involved in a lot of extracurriculars, you were working two jobs, you were doing sports. Would you be able to tell me a little bit more maybe about some of those activities that were meaningful to you or important in some way?"
1002.0,1070.0,Subject,"Back in high school, I tried to do anything to make me not be home. I hated being home when I was in high school. I could not be home. So I literally signed up for everything. I was in basketball. I was in dance. I was step captain. I was in choir. I was volleyball manager. I was in softball. And I did that from sophomore year all the way to senior year. Even though I had a knee injury my junior year, I was still part of the team and still going to practice even though I couldn't play. So yeah. And I also did football outside of school. So it was a lot. I did not like being at home at all, so I did everything I could to not be home."
1070.0,1074.0,Interviewer,"So a better question would have been, ""What didn't you do?"" [laughter]"
1074.0,1078.0,Subject,Yeah. [laughter] I did everything.
1078.0,1090.0,Interviewer,"I mean, if you don't mind me asking-- obviously, you'll only share what you're comfortable sharing. But what was it about your home environment that you didn't want to be a part of?"
1090.0,1136.0,Subject,"I didn't like my stepfather. He was always home. And my sophomore year is when I was diagnosed with depression. So being home was kind of like, ""No."" I didn't want to be locked up in my room with my thoughts. I didn't want to do that. I wanted to be outside. I wanted to enjoy my high school experience the best I could, but with distractions. So signing up for all these teams and clubs was my of distracting myself from my inner demons."
1136.0,1143.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And how did you feel like that worked for you? Did you feel like that was effective?
1143.0,1194.0,Subject,"It did because as soon as I went home, it was homework, and then I was beat. I was tired, so I went straight to sleep. And at one point, it was really like I was at my lowest, which is how I got connected with a therapist because I ended up not going to practice, and I was really at my lowest, and a lot-- depression really took over. And I didn't even know it was depression, so."
1194.0,1209.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So everyone kind of has a different experience with therapy. Some people find it awesome, super helpful; other people, maybe not so much. What was your experience kind of going to therapy for the first time, and working through some of that?"
1209.0,1283.0,Subject,"I wasn't one to open up to people. So I was kind of like, ""Why am I talking to a random stranger about what's going on inside my head?"" Sorry, excuse me. But my mom was like-- has an open mind like, ""They're here to help. This is to make you feel better."" And so the first couple sessions, I was really quiet and let them do all the talking, and it was kind of like one-sentence words. And then we did-- I think it was a breathing exercise, and that really calm me down. And I was like, ""Maybe I should really try more and give it a shot."" And so I did. I didn't hold back anything and I was being honest with my weekly logs, and I saw the difference, so."
1283.0,1313.0,Interviewer,"So great. Wow. I'm happy to hear that. I think it's certainly normal that people have that experience early on of like, ""This is weird. Why am I doing that?"" That sounds productive. What did you feel like was something-- you mentioned the daily logs, the breathing. What were some of the key kind of skills, or thoughts, or something you learned in therapy that you take away and maybe still use today?"
1313.0,1385.0,Subject,"The breathing exercise. That's like you count down from 10. Also, YouTube videos. I really enjoy the-- it's the breathing exercise that I-- it's like a geometrics, like shapes, that as you inhale, it turns into different shapes and it gets bigger. And then as you exhale, it's like the-- I know the last shape is like a triangle, then it goes down. So one single line. And I always do that with the breathing exercise, and I just picture it in my head when I close my eyes and breathe. So that's one that will be stuck with me. And then if I'm angry or really depressed, I eat something sour. The rubber band method, ice cube method, those really stick with me and they help. So yeah."
1385.0,1408.0,Interviewer,"I haven't even heard some of those. That's so cool. So did you feel that your process of kind of going through some of those things made it-- that now you kind of don't have those same struggles, or just made it easier to cope with some of the struggles that you still have?"
1408.0,1423.0,Subject,It made it easier to cope. So I still go through them. They never really went away. But now I know what to do and not just fall back into my old habits.
1423.0,1442.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And so you mentioned also that earlier, you didn't even know if it was depression, what it was. You just were feeling bad. So what was that process like for you actually putting a name to it and having someone say, ""Okay. This is depression""?"
1442.0,1527.0,Subject,"I didn't even know that depression and anxiety was a thing. I thought it was just normal;  everyone goes through this. And then when they explained to me what it was, I was scared, yet calm. Because now we know what's wrong, like, ""Let's fix it,"" and then scared because it was like I didn't want my family or my friends to treat me any different, because that's what tend to happen. And it did happen for a little while until I told them like, ""Hey, I'm getting the help I need. Don't treat me any differently. Treat me how you treated me before you found out."" And I even told my friends that and come to find out my friends were also getting help that they need. Because we all went through the same thing, but at different times. So we were all there for each other because we've all been through it. So it was really helpful."
1527.0,1539.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So what was that like having those types of conversations with them, saying, ""Treat me the way that you were always kind of treating me""? Were they receptive? What was that like?"
1539.0,1580.0,Subject,"They were in denial, like they were treating me the same way. And I was like, ""No. You never ask me if I'm okay every five freaking minutes before. So don't do it now because you're going to get me mad, and I'm going to start overthinking and start falling back."" And so just, ""No,"" like, ""Ask me when you see me, and that's it. Don't be all on top of me making sure I'm not-- just talk to me like how you did before like, 'Let's go play a game,"" like, 'Let's go for a walk,' but don't babysit me."""
1580.0,1600.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, so it sounds like the distraction element that you were trying to focus on was maybe made harder by some of their efforts to remind you and check in on you. Yeah, that's so interesting. Well, actually, we're pretty much up on time. So if it's okay, I'm just going to stop the recording."
