1.0,6.0,Interviewer,Okay. Great. So how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,13.0,Subject,"They've been all right. It's been better to slow down, honestly."
13.0,17.0,Interviewer,"What do you mean by that, to slow down?"
17.0,56.0,Subject,"So I moved to California. I'm in a small town. So comparative to New York City, it's very slow. Honestly, compared to most places, it's very slow. I mean, I haven't been everywhere, of course. But yeah, that's what I mean. It's good to slow down. I feel less intense. I feel less stressed. Also, because now I'm not worried about my housing, so there's that, but also because everything's just so slow."
56.0,63.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So what does a typical day look like for you on this more slow, relaxed timeline?"
63.0,147.0,Subject,"So recently, let's see, I get up. I brush my teeth and everything, then I go for a walk. [Oh, I mean?], I drink some whatever or drink some tea, and then I go for a walk in the morning, listen to music while I'm walking, sorry, one second, and then I come back and then eat breakfast. And then since I don't really have plans, I just see what the other people are doing, and then after that go from there, and then eat dinner, eventually. And since I'm still - what's it called? - jet lagged, I've been going to sleep a lot earlier, so my day ends at 7:00 or 9:00 instead of like it used to. My regular sleeping time is like midnight, so. And I mean, that makes sense because, yeah, 9:00 PM is three-- I mean, it's three hours, yeah. It's midnight there."
147.0,155.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So you mentioned, see what the other people want to do. Are you living with other people?"
155.0,175.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm living with a friend/mentor and then his wife and the wife's mother. But yeah, usually, I'm interacting with more of the wife and my mentor."
175.0,182.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's wonderful. So what has that experience been like living with them and interacting with them?
182.0,221.0,Subject,"It's really nice. They're older, so I think it's more slow and good paced. And they're also just two people who just have the best spirits, honestly, and I can always be honest with both of them about what's going on with me. And it's been good to have that, where I don't feel like I need to filter. It doesn't mean I don't do it, but I feel like I don't need to. So that's been cool."
221.0,237.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So just kind of comparing that to maybe a previous living situation, could you maybe just describe how some of those feelings are similar or different from how you were living in New York City?"
237.0,386.0,Subject,"Well, New York, I was unstable. I mean, I've lived there for the past two years on and off. And there was a reason why I was on and off because it was so unstable for me. But the last living situation, right before I came here, it was like the first day I moved there was so much drama because one roommate didn't want to pay rent. And then she decided that she's going to make it hard for-- she didn't want to leave, and she also had a right not to. And then other [inaudible] girl wanted her to pay rent, and then they kept putting me in the middle of it, and I just really didn't want that. I just moved in, and I'm literally just trying to chill. I'm trying to have a place to be and figure stuff out, and just work until I figure things out. And then my gigs and stuff wasn't happening fast enough, so I'm worried about my rent. And then also, at the same time, I know I couldn't talk to her about it because of all the stuff that was going on. And I didn't really feel comfortable to say what's going on with me. And one time, I had to go to a doctor because I was just so overly stressed about a lot of things. But it didn't help that my housing situation was also stressful. And I didn't even want to cook, honestly, because I just didn't want to interact with neither one of them. And I stayed in my room most of the time. And even when I would go to the bathroom, I felt like I wanted to make sure nobody else was in the hallway because I didn't want to interact with nobody. I really didn't. And I feel like that's most of my living situations that I've had mostly with people is that I feel just like I don't want to be in the way of anything, and I just don't want to be involved. And that's, like I said, most places. And I feel like I carry that with every place I go to. And it even could be a hotel, and nobody knows me or expects anything of me, but I still feel like that, and it's weird."
386.0,401.0,Interviewer,"So do you feel like that feeling that happens, even if you're in hotels, stemmed from that original housing situation where you felt that way, or do you feel like maybe this was something that was more enate in a way?"
401.0,535.0,Subject,"No, it stemmed from probably childhood because I grew up with-- let's see. I grew up with four other siblings and a single mom. And then from time to time my grandmother and my uncle would live there with us, but it was just sometimes, and it's juggling a bunch of personalities. And juggling a bunch of personalities, and then you're going through your own stuff, and your parent makes you feel bad about going through your stuff because it makes it harder for her and all that sort of stuff, and you just want to avoid people. I just always felt like I wanted to avoid people all the time in my house because sometimes I just needed space, or just sometimes I didn't want to get into whatever it is that's going on with other people. And then they would always put you in between what's going on with other people, and I don't want to deal with that. And yeah, I don't know. That's something. And I just felt like I always kept attracting situations like that, like situations like my family, honestly. And I just kept doing it. The first place I moved into, multiple people. And then the second place, just a scary woman. And then third place, I mean, luckily, I was separated from that whole place. But even then, the place that I-- the area, that I had to get out and to the front to, I still had to deal with them, possibly. And I don't know. I just don't want to be around. I just didn't want to see people's faces. And I just really wanted to be alone. And just, I don't know. I know it comes from the house. I just don't know how to describe why I can't even look at people sometimes."
535.0,537.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So [crosstalk]--
537.0,539.0,Subject,And [crosstalk].
539.0,541.0,Interviewer,"No, no, no. Go ahead."
541.0,578.0,Subject," situation-- I mean, of course, I have those two reasons because it was uncomfortable because the people who live there were uncomfortable. But at the same time, I naturally just get uncomfortable because it's just the way I was brought up. But I don't know. I really don't know right now. I'm done."
578.0,582.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Sorry. No, I just wanted to let you have your time."
582.0,585.0,Subject,Thank you. I appreciate that.
585.0,597.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So just thinking a little bit about that feeling that you're talking about about people putting you in the middle. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit and explain kind of what that was like for you?
597.0,770.0,Subject,"It's like, so people would be going through something like-- okay, for example, the last situation, where this girl doesn't want to pay rent, okay. And this girl doesn't want to pay rent, and she's doing all these things. And then I'm finding out all this other information that is not necessary for me to know about her. And then you feel like-- and then people saying judgey statements about her and all this other stuff, and then you feel obligated to join in. And it's like, ""Nah. I don't know her like that, and I don't want to put my assumptions on her that I don't even have assumptions on-- your assumptions on her that I have."" I don't know. I'm trying to say basically, she's trying to put her assumptions on her about what she has about her because of this situation, and I just didn't want that. I wanted to be left alone. And then it became a whole-- and then it became a whole different thing, not just verbally, but physically, where they were moving stuff added cameras, all this other stuff just to make sure that she was so uncomfortable to leave. And then they would show me footage of her and stuff like that, and then talk about what she says and, ""Don't get involved with her,"" and all this other stuff. And it just became-- and they kept saying, ""We're not going to put you in between it."" But I felt so in between it. I didn't feel like I wasn't in between it. I felt very uncomfortable the whole time I was there. And then it reminds of multiple situations where my mom was having a problem with one of my siblings, or one of my siblings was having a problem with another sibling. And it's like, yeah, it's like you're forced to choose sides or even just get involved and try to figure out what's going on. And it's like, ""I don't want to deal with that."" I mean, my mom would even still do that from time to time where it's like, ""Do you talk to your brother?"" and stuff like that. And I'm like, ""No, you could talk to him. He's an adult now."" And I don't know. It's like some things I don't need to be involved in. And those two situations, I don't need to be involved in. You need to just figure out what's going on with her, and my mom needs to figure out what's going on with my brother or sister, whatever, and talk to people instead of trying to get a third party in, or if you're going to get a third part, get a nonbias one or something. I don't know. All I know is it just makes me uncomfortable because sometimes I don't have any of the information because I just have one bias side and then another bias side. And then I feel like I'm supposed to make a bias on both of those things, and I'm like, ""No."""
770.0,784.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That makes sense. So do you feel like it was something that you could voice? I know you felt really uncomfortable in that situation. But was there anyone either in that or outside of that that you felt like you could voice that to?
784.0,891.0,Subject,"No. I didn't really like-- first of all, I mean, growing up, no, my mom always was so dictating and stuff like that. If it was in between her and somebody else, it's like, ""Why are you not taking my side? I'm your mom,"" and all this other stuff or just make me feel guilty. But in this situation, it was like I was kind of mentioning that this is uncomfortable for me and that living here has been uncomfortable for me since I've moved in. But she's saying that it's necessary and stuff like that. I'm like, ""It's really not. Okay. You lost this battle. She's got to leave in 30 days, just let it happen because right now, you're making the whole living situation uncomfortable because you want to make a point. Either way, she's not going to leave, and you can't do anything about the cops or anything like that. The only way you could do it is something that is going to be unlegal. But right now, you're making for a person who actually is paying, uncomfortable."" But I didn't say it in that many words. I said basically, ""This is very uncomfortable,"" and I said, ""She's thriving on it. I understand where you're coming from, but I also understand that I'm not comfortable."" But she was going on and on about how they know it's necessary, and then going on a tangent about something else, and then I didn't feel like my voice was heard. I felt like if I-- but at the same time, I felt like I was being more passive because I knew I had no other way, another place to go. So I didn't assertively put that in there. But this is highly uncomfortable and I don't feel like I should be dealing with this. But if I knew I had another place to go, I would have been more assertive about it."
891.0,899.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It also feels like maybe necessary for who, in terms of what she was saying."
899.0,1041.0,Subject,"I mean, don't get me wrong. I'd be mad too if I was renting a room in my place, and this person wasn't paying, and then knowing that this person's been here long enough to be considered a resident and they can't leave within 30 days. I would be mad too. I'm not mad at her for being mad. There's nothing wrong with that. And it's a frustrating situation. But at the same time, it seems like they spent more fighting her on it than just letting her just go. Either way, it's an uncomfortable living situation for her, and either way, she's only doing it because she has to. It's not because she wants to because obviously if she wanted to, she'd be living somewhere else. So I felt like it's already uncomfortable enough but then to add cameras which is going to cost you money. Which to do stuff with the electrical system, to do all this other stuff just to make it uncomfortable for her, I felt like it was just too much. And then it made me uncomfortable, and it made me not want to be there. There were some times I would just hang out outside of house, and I was like, ""I don't know why I'm doing this because I'm paying rent to be here."" But it's just because it was like I didn't want to talk to her. And I felt like every time I came home, it was something new to talk about with her, and I'm like, ""I don't care."" It got to the point where I just really didn't care. I didn't care about what was going on. I just wanted to say, ""I don't care. You lost this one, just let her stay until then, and then after that, let her go, okay?"" It's not like she didn't lock up her room either, so I was like, ""You have locks on your room."" And another thing that pissed me off is that she wasn't even there a lot of times. In fact, she left me there, in all the height of that sometimes, by myself to deal with. And again, saying that they didn't want to put me in the middle of it. I felt like so in the middle of it, and I had no idea what was going on. I don't even what the question was. All I know is that I don't like being put in the middle of things."
1041.0,1056.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. That was the question. So in terms of how you found this new living situation, how did that come about? Yeah. How did that come about, I guess?"
1056.0,1116.0,Subject,"I was having a hard day either Wednesday or Thursday, cannot remember which day at this moment. And I said that I started planning to commit suicide. And I finished out my workday, started writing a note, and I was yelling at the ceiling, after I closed down the gallery, into the basement where there's nobody there and nobody could hear me. And then I got a phone call from somebody who I called earlier, but they didn't call me until later, which I don't expect anything. But they called me at the right time because I was about to leave and do things. And I'm glad they did. And then after that, it was like starting to make a plan of me just leaving New York and having a safe place to stay instead of doing what I was doing."
1116.0,1119.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what--?
1119.0,1192.0,Subject,"Because I couldn't afford the rent anymore. It was not that I couldn't afford the rent. I wasn't going to be able to get the money until my gallery job was over. And it was not going to be over until October. And I was paying weekly for them and I didn't get any other gigs, where it helps me to pay weekly. But instead, I just got this whole job, where I needed to now be monthly instead of weekly. And she was like, ""No."" So I was trying to figure out so many ways to find another place to live or find money. But it seemed like money wasn't enough. So I was like, well, can you find another place to stay, and I didn't have any money. So I was like, ""I'm screwed. And I can't go to a shelter again. That really is not safe, and then street is even more not safe. I cannot keep doing this to myself. I'm so miserable, and life is just so intolerable."" And I was done."
1192.0,1206.0,Interviewer,"So when you made that decision and you kind of made the plans and you were really seeing that new step to move to California materialize, what did that feel like for you?"
1206.0,1346.0,Subject,"It was like I got a plane ticket for Sunday which was, yeah, last Sunday. And it wasn't much planning, honestly, because really, I had no other plans. Like I said, I couldn't go to a shelter, and it seemed like none of the resources that I was calling all day was helping. And it just got so frustrating because I've been trying to get help with so many things for months, here-- I mean, there, and I couldn't. And now I'm at a point where I am in a deep emergency again, like, ""I need you guys to help me."" And it was just nothing after nothing, message after message. And it's like, basically, it didn't really take much for me to think about moving. It was just like, ""Okay. Do I want to keep suffering here, or do I want to just find a way to live?"" And I mean, it was like even for a while, I was thinking maybe New York is not for me to live in. I mean, I'm an artist and a designer, so I was like, ""Okay. Best place for you to go. But at the same time, I am struggling mentally all the time, and I need to find services. And it seems like, no matter how many times I've lived here, it takes so long for me to even get a glimpse of service for my mental health."" And that's one thing that affects my living situation, my job situation, and all this other stuff. So no matter how many jobs tend to land, I can't keep them. No matter how many housing situations I tend to get, I can't keep them. And I was like, ""Okay. I need to figure out why that keeps happening."" And again, I was trying to find a therapist, trying to find a psychiatrist so I can get medication, all this other stuff that would help me get to where I need to get. But yeah, like I said, it didn't take me long to think about like, ""Okay. This is the best thing for me."""
1346.0,1371.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And so kind of getting to this new place and focusing on maybe getting that foundation established in terms of therapists or psychiatrists-- I know it's just been really recent, but have you found that you're more optimistic about finding a support system kind of emotionally and mentally at your new location?"
1371.0,1431.0,Subject,"Well, so far, I have the system with the two people I talk to here because like I said, I don't feel like I need to filter out what's going on with me. And they are not judgmental and they're trying to help me in many ways. But even just listening to me is very helpful. And yeah, like I said, I have housing. I'm not fearful of being homeless right now. And I have supportive people, so that's one good thing. And then also, I'm in a smaller town, so likely I would be able to be seen a little bit better. And also, I've lived here before, and yes, I would be able to be seen a little bit quicker than I would in the city. And yeah, right now, I'm just trying to figure out my medical insurance, really, and then after that, we'll go from there."
1431.0,1454.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's really great. And obviously, Dr. Herrera, I'm sure, has made herself available and help at all if she can help with all that. Just to let you know, even though you're not in New York anymore, we still care about you. We still want to see you do well, so always happy to help in that way whatever we can."
1454.0,1455.0,Subject,I appreciate that.
1455.0,1461.0,Interviewer,"I really want to thank you so much for your time. Actually, I can stop the recording now, if that's okay with you."
