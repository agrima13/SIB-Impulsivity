tmin,tmax,speaker,message
1.0,5.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,24.0,Subject,"Pretty good. I had one day of kind of like losing the sense of reality kind of thing. It was a little weird, but kind of got out of it within an hour, and then I kind of calmed back down and got back into what I was doing, so."
24.0,30.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How did you manage to get back out of it and calm down in that way?
30.0,49.0,Subject,"I got up and worked out, and then I was also texting my boyfriend, who was at work, and texting my other friend about it to kind of talk it out, figure out what was going on, figure out how it started, and things like that."
49.0,58.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So how have your friends and your boyfriend supported you through situations like this?
58.0,71.0,Subject,"For the most part, they've been really good about it. They've been really supportive. Even my supervisor is pretty supportive of it, and she's like, ""Do what you need to do and take care of that first before everything else,"" so it's good."
71.0,73.0,Interviewer,That's so important. I'm so glad.
73.0,75.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah.
75.0,89.0,Interviewer,"And so, if you don't mind me asking, what is that process like for you to kind of go into that space and kind of try to get out of it? How does that feel for you?"
89.0,147.0,Subject,"Well, it was weird at first because, at first, I honestly didn't even realize it happened. It was after work. I was drinking my pre-workout-- because I work from home, and I'm on the phones all day long. Phones, emails, spreadsheets, reporting, things like that. And I was just scrolling TikTok, weirdly enough, and then it's just like everything just kind of faded away, and it didn't feel like anything was real. And I was like, ""Wait a second. What is going on?"" All of a sudden, I realized-- it was almost like an out-of-body experience, like I'm watching myself, and I'm like, ""What are you doing? It's not real."" And I'm like, ""What's going on here?"" So then, I started, ""What did I see that took me away from it? What happened?"" And I think that I was just really overwhelmed with things at work, and it just kind of got to a point where just everything turned off."
147.0,157.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. What are some of the things that you're kind of navigating at work that may have been contributing to you feeling overwhelmed?
157.0,184.0,Subject,"Well, I'm currently working two positions because we don't have the staff to work my old position when I got promoted. So I'm working my promoted position plus my technical assistant specialist position. Plus, I'm trying to onboard a new person. Plus, my only coworker who's actually on the phones with me is now out for paternity leave, so it's just me."
184.0,185.0,Interviewer,That's not fair.
185.0,187.0,Subject,Oh yeah. It's been fun.
187.0,189.0,Interviewer,"Are you getting three salaries, at least?"
189.0,196.75,Subject,No. I wish. I wish I was getting three salaries. I spent five hours on the phone the other day.
196.75,197.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh.
197.0,228.0,Subject,"And I work on a call-center-type thing for childcare providers and programs who are changing from using the phone or paper to using online for submitting attendance to the government. So I'm working with a lot of older providers, people who aren't tech friendly, tech happy - woo-hoo - and so you spend like an hour and a half on the phone talking them through, ""Yep, you still have to click Save. Each time, yep, click Save."""
228.0,229.0,Interviewer,"Oh, man."
229.0,239.0,Subject,"And then my supervisor yesterday goes, ""I have a 15-page report that I didn't know was due, but I need you to do about half of it."" I was like, ""By when?"" and she was like, ""Friday."" I was like, ""Thanks. Thanks."""
239.0,243.0,Interviewer,Wow. Wow. So you have a ton on your plate.
243.0,244.0,Subject,Yeah.
244.0,250.0,Interviewer,Do you have any sense of the time frame for when you could potentially onboard someone to help you out?
250.0,261.0,Subject,"Well, he's been hired, and I'm in the process of onboarding him, but he doesn't have an email address yet, so he can't have an account in our customer service database. So waiting on that."
261.0,262.0,Interviewer,"Oh, man."
262.0,281.0,Subject,"If I could just get him in and on the phones, I'd be fine. I'd be able to handle some of the rest of it. And my other coworker, he's the only one who speaks fluent Spanish, so if anyone calls having to speak Spanish, we have to then conference in a translator, so it's just that much of an extra thing."
281.0,291.0,Interviewer,Right. And have you been enjoying your position so far? Or how has it been since you started and since you got promoted?
291.0,331.0,Subject,"I like it, I do. I like the more responsibility and the bigger-challenge projects type thing. I'm finding it hard to find balance between what I'm doing. Because I didn't expect to still be working two roles this entire time, so balancing out being with the providers and programs on the phone or email versus my reports, my meetings, all those things is a little bit of a challenge. And there are certain providers or programs who will not speak to anyone else but me, so. It's like, ""No, I have to talk to Jenna."" I'm just like, ""Why? You don't have to talk to me. It's okay. Talk to somebody else."""
331.0,334.0,Interviewer,At least it probably means you're doing a great job.
334.0,336.0,Subject,Yeah. So I call them my best friends.
336.0,342.0,Interviewer,"Aw. Well, that's great that you're doing such a good job, at least that they recognize that and want to speak with you."
342.0,344.0,Subject,Right. Yeah.
344.0,350.0,Interviewer,"So wow. So have you been always fully remote, or do you--?"
350.0,377.0,Subject,"Yeah. Actually, our whole team is fully remote. And we started it after COVID really hit, but they decided that, one, they didn't have space in the office for us, which is fine with me. Two, they were still doing kind of hybrid schedules when we first started, and they were like, ""You guys just stay remote."" And so they've told us we're pretty much indefinitely remote, so it's fine with me."
377.0,378.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So how do you--?
378.0,384.0,Subject,No commute. I'm okay with that. I don't have to commute every day from the Bronx to Brooklyn. I'm okay with that.
384.0,393.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's a thumbs-up. So what are some other pros about work from home that you've been enjoying?
393.0,397.0,Subject,"As bad as it sounds, I don't have to be around people."
397.0,398.0,Interviewer,That's totally fair.
398.0,413.0,Subject,"I just don't have to be. And I find office environments kind of overwhelming sometimes, especially if I'm doing the work that I'm doing right now, on the phone with people all day. Background conversations are going to make it hard, so."
413.0,422.0,Interviewer,So how has it been to balance work and home in the at-home setting?
422.0,453.0,Subject,"I've done better about it now. At first, it kind of felt like, ""Man, I work from home. I live at home. I work from home. I live at home. I'm always here."" But lately, I've been doing less screen time at night or just mindlessly watching TV instead of being on my laptop trying to do other things. Because I have another job too, but that's just an adjunct professor position where basically, all I have to do is grade because I wrote the class five years ago, so."
453.0,454.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh.
454.0,455.0,Subject,Yeah.
455.0,459.0,Interviewer,That sounds really cool. What is that class about?
459.0,461.0,Subject,Early childhood education.
461.0,462.0,Interviewer,Oh wow.
462.0,467.0,Subject,"I have my master's degree in early childhood. I was a preschool teacher in the classroom for 10 years, so."
467.0,468.0,Interviewer,My God.
468.0,484.0,Subject,"Yeah. And so when I got my master's degree, I started working at, actually, the local college down in Florida, and I still work there because it's an online course. And they haven't found anyone else to teach it yet, so I'm like, ""I'll keep doing it. That's fine. Whatever."""
484.0,491.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So do you find that also to be fulfilling, or is it just more something that you're doing on the side?"
491.0,513.0,Subject,"I actually love that job. I love teaching adults. Littles are exhausting. I loved my littles, and we had six weeks to eight years. I loved my littles, but I actually really like working with adults. And this job is also early childhood kind of related, so they kind of tie together, so."
513.0,515.0,Interviewer,Right. So it's almost like best of both worlds.
515.0,516.0,Subject,Right. Right.
516.0,524.0,Interviewer,So what is it about the adults that you like more?
524.0,551.0,Subject,"I think part of it is that future teachers and educators are usually more open to kind of out-of-the-box ideas than other adults might be. But also, I feel like adults need more support in the classroom than we think they do, and, I don't know, I just like being able to give that."
551.0,559.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What types of support have you noticed that adults tend to need?
559.0,599.0,Subject,"A lot of it, at least in the early childhood world, revolves around play and creativity and being allowed to experience that and incorporate that into everything they do. And that's a huge thing for me. That's what I did my master's project on, and everything was play because play is a huge component of early childhood, and a lot of that in schools, obviously, isn't embraced. So I find that I like to challenge them and get them to really think outside the worksheet kind of thing when it comes to activities and things like that."
599.0,608.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what was it about play that got you interested early on?
608.0,631.0,Subject,"A lot of it's how children use play to express everything, to work things out, to figure things out. Anything going on at home, it shows up in play, and it just helps them figure things out. And they learn easier. They learn better."
631.0,645.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's so interesting. So when you're instructing these adults, are you kind of simultaneously teaching them about the benefits of play or how children express themselves through play, or is it more--?"
645.0,646.75,Subject,[crosstalk].
646.75,647.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. You do."
647.0,659.0,Subject,"It's both. It's a lot of the history and then developmentally appropriate practices, and then it's, ""How do we tie this content into what children need--"""
659.0,660.0,Interviewer,Wow.
660.0,676.0,Subject,"""--emotionally, mentally, but also creatively? How can you do it without doing-- without you making a perfect little product for them to see, how can you embrace their creativity while getting them to kind of do what you want them to do?"""
676.0,695.0,Interviewer,"Right. And so, in a way, do you feel-- I guess, how do you, in a classroom, recommend that people incorporate the child's voice and creativity as much as possible while also getting them to a certain objective?"
695.0,723.0,Subject,"A lot of what I did was open ended. Give them materials and tell them, ""How many of those would it take to make a square?"" or whatever. We would do things like that, and then they're counting. They're doing shape recognition. They're building, so they're figuring out those cognitive, ""How do these go together?"" kind of things. Things like that."
723.0,738.0,Interviewer,"Wow. And do you have any experience that you currently try to have to put that in practice with children now, or are you just too strapped for time with all these--?"
738.0,759.0,Subject,"No, I'm not with kids now. Like I said, I still do the course, so I still encourage all that. And then I have nieces and nephews that, whenever I see them, I do that and annoy their parents with [laughter] goals."
759.0,761.0,Interviewer,But it probably helps them at the end of the day.
761.0,769.0,Subject,"Eventually, it does. If you're going to ask me my professional opinion, you're going to get it. So my brother has learned that."
769.0,792.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So how has your relationship with your friends and even your boyfriend kind of moved through this time of the pandemic with, now, work from home and all these other changes that people have been experiencing?"
792.0,814.0,Subject,"My close friendships have become a lot closer. The ones that I found weren't really friendships have kind of fallen apart or started getting, I don't know, less friendly, as awful as that sounds. But I also moved from Florida, where I lived for 27 years, to New York last year, so that was--"
814.0,815.0,Interviewer,Just last year.
815.0,831.0,Subject,"Only last year, yep. That was a huge change. Because boyfriend already lived here, I came to live with him and start things over, get out of a toxic environment down there at work and move beyond that."
831.0,839.0,Interviewer,Wow. So how did you find New York when you first made the switch?
839.0,849.0,Subject,"My boyfriend already lived here. He was actually born in the Bronx, and then he went to Florida for a few years. That's where we met. And then he ended up back in New York."
849.0,856.0,Interviewer,And what was your impression overall of kind of the different lifestyle?
856.0,865.0,Subject,"It's a huge difference. I mean, I lived in Cape Coral and Fort Myers, which is like retirement capital of the country practically, in Florida."
865.0,866.0,Interviewer,Right. And-- yeah.
866.0,880.0,Subject,"So I mean, when we moved there in 1995, we were the only house on the road. I now live in a shared apartment with seven other people, so it's very different."
880.0,881.0,Interviewer,Got it.
881.0,894.0,Subject,"Because we live in Little Italy, so it's very close compared to Florida, where it was like houses, houses, houses, not apartment buildings and things like that."
894.0,907.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So perspective-wise, do you feel that it is something that you have come to appreciate, something that you're still working on? Where are you now in terms of how much you like it?"
907.0,936.0,Subject,"I honestly love it. I didn't really think I'd like the big city because I am not a city person. We are planning on moving out of the city soon, but I do like it. I kind of like the hustle and bustle sometimes, and where we are, the people are very nice, and I haven't had any problems, and I feel safe. I feel good. I've had less problems here than I did in Fort Myers, so I'm good."
936.0,943.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's great. And what was the experience like of moving in with your boyfriend for the first time?
943.0,963.0,Subject,"That took some adjustment and still takes some adjustment, but I lived with my parents before this, so. Because I had lived in apartments by myself for a few years, and then I moved back home when my job said, ""Oh, hey, we don't have a building anymore. We might not have jobs after December."" ""Oh, okay. Cool. Thanks."""
963.0,964.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh.
964.0,989.0,Subject,"That was when I worked at the childcare center. Because they were like, ""The college isn't letting us stay here. We haven't found a building yet, so."" And that was November, and then December was the end. So it was like, ""Okay, cool,"" so I moved home because I was like, ""If I don't have a job, I can't pay rent."" So I moved back home with my cat, and then my mom, dad, and my little brother still live there, so."
989.0,997.0,Interviewer,"And that experience, how did it compare to now, your current living experience?"
997.0,1002.0,Subject,"Still having to share the shower with man people, so. [laughter]"
1002.0,1004.0,Interviewer,There's that.
1004.0,1019.0,Subject,"It's pretty good. I mean, I learned to live with people. I lived in dorms in college too, so I'm pretty used to it. I just mind my own and do what I have to do and avoid the people. [laughter]"
1019.0,1039.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So I know that you said that you've been having a very large workload, so the balance has been difficult. Are there any things that you've been trying to incorporate into your life to introduce more kind of life balance in the work-life situation?"
1039.0,1072.0,Subject,"More to-do lists, but also just breaking down my days like, ""This needs to be done this day. This needs to be done this day."" Things like that. And it helps that, weirdly, in Microsoft, you can share to-do lists with people, which is weird, but whatever. So my supervisor shares it with me so that we can both keep track of, ""Hey, we're on this. Hey, we're on this."" And then, outside of work, I'm trying to read more, do more journaling, listen to more music, things like that that aren't like, ""Let's be on the computer all day."""
1072.0,1075.0,Interviewer,So kind of unplugging in that way.
1075.0,1076.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah.
1076.0,1078.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's [crosstalk].
1078.0,1090.0,Subject,"Because that's the one thing that's exhausting about remote work is being on the computer all day. I mean, if we were in the office, I'd still be on the computer all day, except I'd have meetings with real people, and I'm okay without them."
1090.0,1103.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And also, food can be difficult to prepare or pay for, or there's just this whole other food consideration when you have to go in person. That's [usually?]--"
1103.0,1125.0,Subject,"Right. And it's nice to be able to just-- like I wanted a smoothie this morning. I can just whip out the blender and make something. I don't have to prep everything ahead of time, things like that. I used to meal prep like crazy when I worked in the childcare center, and it's like, ""Oh, it's so nice not to have to do that."" I can just grab whatever I want and come back to my desk."
1125.0,1130.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. It saves so much mental and time energy.
1130.0,1131.0,Subject,Yeah. And money.
1131.0,1133.0,Interviewer,"And money, yeah."
1133.0,1142.0,Subject,And commuting. Really glad I don't have a commute. No gas. No anything.
1142.0,1150.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How did you find the experience of most people not having cars here? Was that an adjustment?
1150.0,1172.0,Subject,"Not really, because I didn't have one. I never had one in Florida, so. I mean, I walked everywhere. I walked to the grocery store, which was not like the Bronx that it's two blocks away. It was a mile and a half away or a mile away across a seven-lane major road, things like that."
1172.0,1173.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So--
1173.0,1194.0,Subject,"I was pretty used to that, though, so that wasn't a big adjustment for me. It was like when I lived on college campuses too. People had cars, but I lived at one of the major universities in Florida - it was the University of South Florida in Tampa, and then I went to St. Pete's - so it was like everything was on campus, so."
1194.0,1202.0,Interviewer,So how was Tampa relative to Fort Myers and relative to New York?
1202.0,1214.0,Subject,"I'd say it's between Fort Myers and New York in busyness, people, things like that. In Tampa, I lived in a super-sketchy neighborhood that was like, ""Nope, don't go outside at night. Thank you."" Yeah."
1214.0,1218.0,Interviewer,Oh wow.
1218.0,1230.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, it was right around campus, so it was an apartment off campus but a mile away, and it was like, ""Downtown Tampa, ooh."""
1230.0,1245.0,Interviewer,"So you mentioned that you would be interested in living in a nonmajor city at some point, potentially. Do you have any thoughts about where, or?"
1245.0,1247.75,Subject,We're looking at Sullivan and Ulster counties.
1247.75,1248.0,Interviewer,"Oh, cool."
1248.0,1282.0,Subject,"Yeah. Like hour and a half outside of the city. He works in the city, but we also are starting a business, and the business is going to be towing and hauling and all this, [really?]. ""I'm not doing it, but I will be your secretary. That's fine. I will make all your invoices and do all your web work and things like that. You can do the giant driving of big trucks. Have fun."" But that way, we can have somewhere to park the vehicles and things like that, and then we're out of the city."
1282.0,1286.0,Interviewer,"That's pretty exciting, no? To be making that big of a decision."
1286.0,1322.75,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. We've had the business for about a year now, and now we're moving into doing more of the towing and the hauling and stuff, so we have to get more certifications and things like that. It's more paperwork, things like that, so going through the motions of getting those done. And he actually had a run today. People call him and are like, ""Hey, we need this delivered to Philadelphia."" And I'm like, ""You're going to drive to Philadelphia with a box truck? For who?"" And he's like, ""I don't know. Friends of this guy."" I was like, ""Okay."" But has to be at his normal job at 1 o'clock, so it's like--"
1322.75,1323.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1323.0,1325.0,Subject,"--""You work a lot."" Okay."
1325.0,1329.0,Interviewer,Wow. I guess whatever keeps the business running.
1329.0,1343.0,Subject,"Yes, exactly. And it's something he's always wanted to do, so kind of tie in my organizational skills and computer skills and things like that with his drive to do that and make it into a lucrative business."
1343.0,1351.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, totally. So it sounds like the job that you have now might be the perfect transition point and practice or [inaudible], almost, for the work that you might be doing for business."
1351.0,1389.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. When he says, ""Oh, people are going to call you to set things up,"" I was like, ""No. No more calls. No."" I talk to 37 million people a day. I'm okay without more calls. But yeah, I definitely see where the Excel things and things like that will definitely tie into doing that, and the communications I've been doing, mass communications to like 8,000 people. It's like I've never thought I would ever write, ""Oh, hey, you should do this. This is how you can do it really easy. Reach out to us. Let us know."""
1389.0,1395.75,Interviewer,"Yeah. Wow. Well, I bet everyone's just going to be saying that they want to speak to Jenna too."
1395.75,1396.0,Subject,Always.
1396.0,1400.0,Interviewer,It's just going to be even more people on your plate.
1400.0,1416.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, it's funny because I'm not supposed to be on the phones, available, in the afternoon. I'm only supposed to be there in the morning, so I've started telling people. I'm like, ""If you want to talk to me, you've got to call me in the morning, or you've got to send me an email, and I'll give you a call when I have time,"" because nope."
1416.0,1426.0,Interviewer,"So do you feel that in this-- how have you been navigating setting boundaries with your supervisor, with these clients?"
1426.0,1461.75,Subject,"Well, the good thing is my supervisor is really into the work-life balance kind of thing, so that really helps. And she loves to travel and things like that, and so she is totally fine with that balance. She doesn't call after work, things like that. I have a hard time not going in and doing spreadsheets or catching up on reports or things like that, but I have really tried not to start before 8:45 and be done by 5:30 at the latest."
1461.75,1462.0,Interviewer,[It's so kind of?]--
1462.0,1472.0,Subject,"I'm supposed to work 9:00 to 5:00, but. And I have been trying to take lunch breaks and actually take them, not sit here and look at email while I'm on lunch break, so."
1472.0,1477.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It's always a temptation.
1477.0,1487.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Especially when somebody's like, ""Oh, hey, we have a meeting tomorrow. You need this prepared,"" and my anxiety is like, ""Nope. I need to get started on that."""
1487.0,1493.0,Interviewer,There is something nice about knowing that at least the pressure is not coming from her directly--
1493.0,1495.0,Subject,Right. Right.
1495.0,1496.0,Interviewer,--at least. Yeah.
1496.0,1537.0,Subject,"And the other nice part is we are contracted to do this work for a government group, and so it's like they are very 8:30 to 5:00. They are not working outside their hours, really, either, unless they're sending us emails at 3 o'clock in the morning. And I'm like, ""I'm not responding to you at 3 o'clock in the morning."" I received one once from a guy, and I was like, ""Why are you emailing at 3 o'clock in the morning? Nope. Nope."" And I don't have the email set up to my phone, things like that. I was specifically like, ""Nope. I'm not putting that on my phone because then I'm going to see it pop up all the time and go like, 'Oh, what did they say?'"""
1537.0,1538.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It's so true.
1538.0,1553.0,Subject,"And the nice part about the clients is that that's all in a web-based customer service platform, Zendesk, so it doesn't come to my normal email. So it only comes there, so that's nice."
1553.0,1555.0,Interviewer,"So if you just click out of that, you're good."
1555.0,1556.0,Subject,Yeah.
1556.0,1556.75,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so good."
1556.75,1557.0,Subject,Yeah.
1557.0,1559.0,Interviewer,So good.
1559.0,1563.0,Subject,"And I can go offline if I need to, like, ""Okay. I need a break from the phones for a minute. Stop calling me."""
1563.0,1576.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's great. So what are some of the responsibilities at your job that you really like and that you would maybe even want to do more of?"
1576.0,1675.0,Subject,"Like I said, the communications is actually something that I really enjoy. I don't know if you know what Mailchimp is, but I love it. I love being able to create like, ""Hey, this is the easiest way to do this."" I love being able to get to the providers' level and get them excited to use the online system instead of, ""Are they seriously changing it? Why are they changing it?"" And then it's like, ""Okay. Why are you yelling at me? I didn't do it. I didn't do it."" But it's hard for them because it's a big change. Previously, if you were taking care of children and getting paid by the government to do so, all you had to do was, every month, you just had to report how many days you had the kid. That's it. Now, you have to enter daily time in and time out attendance and submit that monthly because they changed all the laws so that now they have to be able to track time in and time out attendance, not just the number of days, to help with fraud and authorized hours and things like that, which is totally understandable. Whatever. But this is how they decided to do it. ""Let's go use an online system that uses military time,"" which confuses everything, confuses people out of their minds, things like that. But they're finding they get paid quicker, it's more accurate, things like that, so it's a plus. There are those pluses. There are those minuses. And people are still struggling, and by October 1st, they can use nothing else but the online system unless they have a religious exemption, which is totally different. But other than that, they're all online with us."
1675.0,1676.0,Interviewer,Wow. And--
1676.0,1686.0,Subject,"So we have to do all the outreach, and if I never have to cold-call a person again, I'll be fine, but."
1686.0,1691.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Wait. So people get to put in their own hours still, though. Right?"
1691.0,1692.0,Subject,Yeah.
1692.0,1693.0,Interviewer,So how is--?
1693.0,1695.0,Subject,It just depends on when the kids come to them.
1695.0,1704.0,Interviewer,I see. So how is there any type of external verification of that input?
1704.0,1714.0,Subject,"If they decided to audit, the provider program would have to have paper or electronic sign-in sheets from the parents."
1714.0,1715.0,Interviewer,Oh.
1715.0,1737.0,Subject,"Because what happens, usually, is they're in-home providers, so they'll have, literally, a composition notebook for each day or a page for each day. I don't know how they do it. A page for each child, maybe. And they have the date, the time, parent's signature that they got there, and then date, time, and parent's signature that they left."
1737.0,1739.0,Interviewer,Got it. Wow. So that's--
1739.0,1754.0,Subject,"And for bigger programs, they probably have an online system like we used to use. It's called Procare, and they literally use their fingerprint on a machine and then just tap the children, and it automatically clocks the kids in with their initials."
1754.0,1757.0,Interviewer,Got it. Wow. So that's so much more precise then.
1757.0,1758.0,Subject,Right.
1758.0,1765.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so interesting. Well, I want to be mindful of your time. I know you're super busy, so I'm going to stop the recording, if that's okay with you."
