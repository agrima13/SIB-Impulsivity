2.0,6.0,Interviewer,All right. So how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,15.0,Subject,"Things have been going-- I mean, all right, I guess."
15.0,18.0,Interviewer,So what have you been up to?
18.0,21.0,Subject,Nothing much. I've just been chilling at home.
21.0,26.0,Interviewer,Nice. How have you been feeling about that?
26.0,28.0,Subject,Normal.
28.0,38.0,Interviewer,And is there something that you are kind of looking forward to in the future or working towards?
38.0,40.0,Subject,Getting a job.
40.0,44.0,Interviewer,"Oh, cool. Are you actively looking for any jobs now?"
44.0,46.0,Subject,Not really.
46.0,53.0,Interviewer,Okay. So what type of position might you be interested in doing in the future?
53.0,55.0,Subject,I don't really know.
55.0,57.0,Interviewer,Are you just kind of open to anything?
57.0,59.0,Subject,Yeah.
59.0,68.0,Interviewer,"That's nice. Is there anything that you kind of have an interest in, at least to look into preliminarily?"
68.0,77.0,Subject,"I mean, I play guitar, so. I guess that's something."
77.0,81.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Definitely. How long have you been playing guitar?
81.0,84.0,Subject,Five years.
84.0,97.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. And is that something that you-- would you consider that a hobby of yours, or something that you maybe want to take more seriously in the future?"
97.0,99.0,Subject,Both.
99.0,104.0,Interviewer,Wow. Cool. So what got you into guitar?
104.0,110.0,Subject,Kurt Cobain.
110.0,114.0,Interviewer,Can you tell me a little more about that?
114.0,153.0,Subject,"Well, when I was 12 or something, I think. I was watching this YouTube video where-- it's kind of a messed-up genre, but it's just a person that talks shit about everything and everyone. And he was talking about kids not being born in the right generation and shit, and people who fill entitled to their music taste. And this guy mentioned Nirvana, so I started listening to Nirvana, and then I just started playing guitar because of them."
153.0,163.0,Interviewer,"Wow. That's so cool. So was it with their music that you started learning, as well, or were they more of just an inspiration for you?"
163.0,167.0,Subject,They were more an inspiration.
167.0,178.0,Interviewer,Cool. And so how long do you have to practice-- what's your routine like in terms of working on guitar stuff?
178.0,183.0,Subject,I usually play for a couple hours a day. That's about it.
183.0,194.0,Interviewer,"Wow. That's so cool. And do you have any interest in starting a band or doing this with other people, or is this more of a solo project?"
194.0,196.0,Subject,Solo project.
196.0,208.0,Interviewer,Cool. Okay. So you mentioned that it might be something that you're interested in taking forward in the future. Can you say a little bit more about what that would look like?
208.0,214.0,Subject,I don't know.
214.0,223.0,Interviewer,"What's the massive, most [bubbled?] dream that you have about guitar-related stuff?"
223.0,239.0,Subject,"I really only care about making money about it. So I guess when I finally do make that money, just chilling and being financially stable without having to worry about anything."
239.0,252.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I think that's such a good goal. What are some ways that you've brainstormed in terms of making money out of this guitar hobby that you have right now?
252.0,261.0,Subject,"I mean, I don't really know."
261.0,266.0,Interviewer,What if you did tutoring-- you taught people how to play guitar?
266.0,274.0,Subject,"I mean, that's pretty good money, but it requires a lot of patience. [laughter]"
274.0,286.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And how do you feel about patience-- do you feel like that's a characteristic of yours that you're strong at or that you may want to work on?
286.0,292.0,Subject,"I mean, I can be patient, but it depends on [will?] it for."
292.0,299.0,Interviewer,So what are some things that you are patient for versus other things that you may not be patient for?
299.0,310.0,Subject,"I don't like waiting for people, but if I was playing guitar and learning something new. I'd be more patient with it."
310.0,322.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That makes sense. So does that mean that you feel like, maybe, you're a little bit more patient with yourself when you're learning stuff that's hard?"
322.0,324.0,Subject,Yeah.
324.0,338.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's interesting. What else do you think would be necessary in terms of qualities that you'd have to have if you were to be a teacher of guitar?"
338.0,341.0,Subject,I don't really know.
341.0,344.0,Interviewer,Is that interesting at all as an idea to you?
344.0,345.0,Subject,What tutoring?
345.0,347.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
347.0,350.0,Subject,Probably if I'm old.
350.0,354.0,Interviewer,I feel like if you're good. It doesn't matter if you're old. [laughter]
354.0,358.75,Subject,"I rather do that when I'm 70 years old, and I have--"
358.75,359.0,Interviewer,"Oh, yeah. [laughter]"
359.0,361.0,Subject,--dementia.
361.0,363.0,Interviewer,"That's a while away, no?"
363.0,365.0,Subject,Yeah.
365.0,371.0,Interviewer,All right. So what about in the meantime-- between now and 70?
371.0,376.0,Subject,"I don't know. I guess, just making music."
376.0,378.0,Interviewer,"Oh, so you record your music?"
378.0,379.0,Subject,"I mean, sometimes."
379.0,387.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. Oh, that's so cool. What's that like to record your music?"
387.0,390.0,Subject,It's weird.
390.0,391.0,Interviewer,"What do you mean, weird?"
391.0,398.0,Subject,Because it's weird to hear what you play recorded.
398.0,401.0,Interviewer,Weird in a good way-- weird in a bad way?
401.0,409.0,Subject,"I mean, not a bad way, but-- I mean, yeah. Not a bad way."
409.0,424.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And do you ever do any other type of accompaniment with your guitar? Are you ever interested in singing with it or any other stuff like that, or is it more just pure guitar?"
424.0,428.0,Subject,It's usually just guitar.
428.0,438.0,Interviewer,Cool. And are there any other hobbies that you've been kind of developing during this time besides guitar stuff?
438.0,440.0,Subject,I got back into Legos.
440.0,441.75,Interviewer,Ooh.
441.75,442.0,Subject,Yeah.
442.0,450.0,Interviewer,That is so fun. What has that been like-- how did you find your way back to Legos?
450.0,462.0,Subject,"I don't know. I just used to do a lot of it as a kid, and then I just wanted to do it again. So I asked my mom for a couple sets."
462.0,464.0,Interviewer,So what have you been building?
464.0,466.0,Subject,Just Lego Star Wars.
466.0,475.0,Interviewer,"Oh, nice. Are they the ones with the really tiny pieces that are really elaborate?"
475.0,477.0,Subject,Yeah.
477.0,484.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh. That's so cool. How long has it been taking you to be working on these-- start to finish?
484.0,488.0,Subject,Not long. They usually take 30 minutes or an hour.
488.0,497.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh. That's pretty quick. So does that mean that you need to buy a couple more and keep going?
497.0,498.0,Subject,Yeah.
498.0,502.0,Interviewer,So what's next in the Lego world for you?
502.0,508.0,Subject,I don't really know. I think I'ma just stick to Star Wars.
508.0,520.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm. And what are some qualities that make somebody able to be good at doing Legos?
520.0,528.0,Subject,"I don't really know, just patience, I guess. And know what to do and know how to read instructions."
528.0,532.0,Interviewer,"Oh, yeah. How does it work? Do you have to follow the instructions the whole time?"
532.0,533.0,Subject,Yeah.
533.0,541.0,Interviewer,"Oh, I didn't realize that. Neat. So what's the process? So you get the box. And then how do you go start to finish?"
541.0,551.0,Subject,"They come in different bags and different pieces, and then you just do one part at a time, and then you put everything together."
551.0,557.75,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. And the instruction manual tells you what part goes where or--"
557.75,558.0,Subject,Yeah.
558.0,559.0,Interviewer,--where to start?
559.0,560.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
560.0,575.0,Interviewer,"Oh, nice. That's cool. And so is there anybody else who you're currently doing these Legos with, or is this more of a project that you like doing on your own as well?"
575.0,579.0,Subject,I do it on my own.
579.0,582.0,Interviewer,Do you think it would be fun to do it with other people?
582.0,584.0,Subject,Not really.
584.0,586.0,Interviewer,How come?
586.0,589.0,Subject,I don't know.
589.0,595.0,Interviewer,So are there any other projects that you have going on besides Legos and guitar?
595.0,597.0,Subject,Not really.
597.0,613.0,Interviewer,"Cool. I mean, it sounds like those are taking up a good portion of time anyway, so. Okay. So in terms of social stuff. Is there anything that you have been up to socially?"
613.0,614.0,Subject,No.
614.0,620.0,Interviewer,Do you want to be up to something socially or no?
620.0,621.0,Subject,Not really.
621.0,628.0,Interviewer,Nice. Okay. And how has it been-- do you live with other people besides your mom?
628.0,629.0,Subject,Yeah. My big brother.
629.0,635.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. What's it like having a big brother?"
635.0,636.0,Subject,It's all right.
636.0,640.0,Interviewer,It's all right. What does that mean?
640.0,644.0,Subject,"I mean, it's cool-- a bigger brother."
644.0,647.0,Interviewer,All right. Do you feel like you guys have a good relationship?
647.0,650.0,Subject,Yeah.
650.0,654.0,Interviewer,So what does it mean for you to have a good relationship with your older brother?
654.0,662.0,Subject,"I don't know. I mean, it's not like we're fighting or anything."
662.0,673.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. But what does it mean to you to be a good younger brother to him, or to have him be a good older brother to you?"
673.0,679.0,Subject,"I don't know. Just not making each other mad, I guess."
679.0,684.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Cool. And what's he up to?
684.0,686.0,Subject,He just works.
686.0,689.0,Interviewer,"Oh, he works. What does he do?"
689.0,695.0,Subject,He does these cooking classes for little kids.
695.0,697.0,Interviewer,That's so cute.
697.0,698.0,Subject,Yeah.
698.0,703.0,Interviewer,"Wow. Have you ever seen him doing it, or is it in person?"
703.0,704.0,Subject,It's in person.
704.0,709.0,Interviewer,Oh. That's so cute. How old are the kids?
709.0,713.0,Subject,"Like, 9, 10ish."
713.0,721.0,Interviewer,Oh. So is he the chef of the house?
721.0,722.0,Subject,"I mean, we all are."
722.0,723.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you all are?"
723.0,724.0,Subject,Yeah. We all--
724.0,727.0,Interviewer,Do you--
727.0,731.0,Subject,"I mean, cooking's fun."
731.0,737.0,Interviewer,So how does it work in your house-- how do you guys decide who is going to cook or what you guys are going to eat?
737.0,744.0,Subject,"We just make whatever-- [whenever we want?] someone, so."
744.0,747.0,Interviewer,"Whoever wants-- wait, sorry. Say that again."
747.0,762.0,Subject,"Well, the person who cooks for everyone in the house is my mom, but I mostly cook for myself when my mom's not home."
762.0,772.0,Interviewer,"Oh, so you're saying that if you're having a meal together. Your mom will cook for all you guys, but if you're just cooking one meal all for yourself, then you'll each do that for yourselves?"
772.0,773.0,Subject,Yeah.
773.0,779.0,Interviewer,"Oh, nice. So what are some things that you know how to cook that are really good?"
779.0,787.0,Subject,"Basically, anything that's not hard."
787.0,788.0,Interviewer,"Oh, really?"
788.0,789.0,Subject,Yeah. [crosstalk] it's just--
789.0,799.0,Interviewer,--find it hard. What are some things that you are-- your go-to's?
799.0,801.0,Subject,Probably Philly Cheese Steak.
801.0,815.0,Interviewer,Whoo. That sounds so complicated. I can't believe it's easy. How long does it take to make that?
815.0,817.0,Subject,Probably 30 minutes.
817.0,825.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh. Wow. And what type of food is your brother teaching to these kids-- is there a curriculum of some sort?
825.0,829.0,Subject,It's usually vegan and very healthy.
829.0,862.0,Interviewer,"Oh, interesting. And is that a lifestyle that he pursues outside of his job as well, or is that only for the job? Is he vegan at home as well, or is that only for his job?"
862.0,864.0,Subject,No. He's vegan at home as well.
864.0,870.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. And what are some of his reasons for wanting to be vegan, do you know?"
870.0,908.0,Subject,"Because a lot of the food that we eat is actually poison. And a lot of the food that we eat is just filled with random-ass chemicals that are in things like cleaning things. The same chemicals in food would be in Windex or in battery acid or some shit. It would be really fucked up. There's this flavor - I forgot what it is - but it's unborn fetuses, and it's used in a lot of food."
908.0,909.0,Interviewer,No way.
909.0,915.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's called MSA something, and it's in a lot--"
915.0,916.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
916.0,919.0,Subject,--a lot.
919.0,922.0,Interviewer,What types of food?
922.0,949.0,Subject,"Basically, everything name brand that you see all over the place. Literally, everything-- mostly, everything. Even fresh food-- veggies and fruits. A lot of them are grown genetically in a lab, so they're not real fruit, and the same thing with everything else."
949.0,970.0,Interviewer,"Oh my God. So how does he know which fresh food he wants to eat, even if it's vegan if so much of this is also being grown genetically modified and all that?"
970.0,976.0,Subject,"I mean, I don't know where he gets the stuff from, but his stuff is usually good."
976.0,986.0,Interviewer,So does that factor into-- how do you navigate not being poisoned by this stuff-- do you--?
986.0,989.0,Subject,I don't really.
989.0,990.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you don't care?"
990.0,994.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't. That's the life we have-- oh, well."
994.0,1003.0,Interviewer,That's crazy. Wait. So what other chemicals does he talk about that are in foods?
1003.0,1019.0,Subject,"It's just a lot of-- I don't know. It's just compositions of really fucked-up shit. Things that you normally would be like, ""I can't eat that,"" is in the things that you would be like, ""I would eat that."""
1019.0,1020.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1020.0,1021.0,Subject,Yeah.
1021.0,1026.0,Interviewer,Oh my God. I'ma look at everything in my house now. [laughter]
1026.0,1030.0,Subject,And there's a lot of microplastics in food.
1030.0,1032.0,Interviewer,Microplastic?
1032.0,1033.0,Subject,Yeah.
1033.0,1041.0,Interviewer,"Oh my God. So mainly, processed foods. Is that what you're saying in terms of the name brands?"
1041.0,1042.0,Subject,Yeah.
1042.0,1044.0,Interviewer,Cereals and that other stuff?
1044.0,1045.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
1045.0,1054.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. What about meats-- how does that play into his vegan stuff?"
1054.0,1068.0,Subject,"I don't know he just-- I don't know. Meat is pretty bad for you anyway. If you eat a lot of meat, you're going to be unhealthy, so."
1068.0,1072.0,Interviewer,"Mm-hmm. So overall, he is vegan for the health reasons?"
1072.0,1074.0,Subject,Yeah.
1074.0,1092.0,Interviewer,"Got it. And so how come-- what's your thought process around not caring about these types of chemicals or this type of stuff in your food? What got you to the place where you were like, ""Whatever, it doesn't matter""?"
1092.0,1104.0,Subject,"I mean, nothing really bothers me anymore because-- I don't know. I guess I've just seen a lot of fucked-up shit, so I don't really care anymore."
1104.0,1108.0,Interviewer,"So just, relatively, it doesn't matter that much, given everything else?"
1108.0,1110.0,Subject,Yep.
1110.0,1117.0,Interviewer,Got it. And how about your mom-- does she follow any type of food situation that's special or no?
1117.0,1119.0,Subject,Nope.
1119.0,1125.0,Interviewer,So what's it like living with both of them?
1125.0,1129.0,Subject,"It's fine, I guess."
1129.0,1131.0,Interviewer,Are there any pros and cons?
1131.0,1143.0,Subject,"I mean, I guess they could get on my nerves sometime."
1143.0,1147.0,Interviewer,So that's a con. What are some pros?
1147.0,1150.0,Subject,That they're there for me.
1150.0,1158.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Oh, that's so nice. What are some examples of how they're there for you in different situations?"
1158.0,1165.0,Subject,"I don't really know. I just know, if I was to go through something, they would help."
1165.0,1183.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so important. That's so nice. Is there any way that you feel like each of them shows their love differently? Is there one way that your mom might show it-- that's she's taking care of you and that she cares versus your brother might have some different way?"
1183.0,1185.0,Subject,Yeah.
1185.0,1188.0,Interviewer,What are the differences?
1188.0,1196.0,Subject,"I mean, I don't-- I can't really point them out right now."
1196.0,1212.0,Interviewer,"What is it about-- do you have any sense of why-- I mean, obviously, they love you, and they're there for you. But is there anything that they've done that really emphasizes that feeling for you-- at least in recent memory?"
1212.0,1214.0,Subject,I don't really know.
1214.0,1247.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's a tough one. We're almost done. We only have 5ish more minutes left. Okay. So you like living with them. Pros and cons-- pro is that they are there for you and they support you. Con is sometimes they can get on your nerves, which happens to everyone probably. Do you feel like you guys have-- how do you guys have different lifestyles? What are their-- when do they kind of go about their life versus how do you go about your life?"
1247.0,1249.0,Subject,"I mean, I don't really know."
1249.0,1252.0,Interviewer,Are you guys on the same schedule?
1252.0,1258.0,Subject,Nah. They have their own things to do. I don't really have that much things to do.
1258.0,1275.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm. And so has it been positive for you or negative for you that you guys are not really synced in terms of your schedules?
1275.0,1277.0,Subject,Wait. What was the question?
1277.0,1286.0,Interviewer,"Basically, what are some pros or cons about the fact that you guys are not synced in terms of your schedules?"
1286.0,1300.0,Subject,"Well, a con would be that my mom works until 5:00, and I would like to go places before."
1300.0,1307.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. So are you saying you'd want to go with her to do some stuff?
1307.0,1311.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, to go places earlier."
1311.0,1315.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What types of places would you like to go to?
1315.0,1319.0,Subject,"Sometimes, I like to go to Yonkers, to go to Ridge Hill."
1319.0,1325.0,Interviewer,Whoo. Is that far from where you currently live?
1325.0,1327.0,Subject,It's a 30-minute drive.
1327.0,1332.0,Interviewer,"Oh, not bad. That's fun. And what's up there-- why do you like going there?"
1332.0,1334.0,Subject,Guitar Center.
1334.0,1338.0,Interviewer,Ooh. That massive store?
1338.0,1341.0,Subject,"Yeah. They have a LEGOLAND, too."
1341.0,1342.0,Interviewer,They have what?
1342.0,1343.0,Subject,A LEGOLAND.
1343.0,1346.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my. So you're basically in Heaven over there."
1346.0,1349.0,Subject,Yeah. [laughter]
1349.0,1355.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Oh my God. That's so cool. That's the place where they have all the guitars on the wall, right?"
1355.0,1356.0,Subject,Yeah.
1356.0,1365.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh. Yeah. I'm sure that's a musician's Heaven. And can you play them when you go into the store and stuff? Ooh.
1365.0,1366.0,Subject,Yeah.
1366.0,1371.0,Interviewer,Do you have your eye on any specific one for the future?
1371.0,1377.0,Subject,"I mean, been looking at basses more-- bass guitars."
1377.0,1378.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm.
1378.0,1385.0,Subject,Because I want to get back into bass.
1385.0,1394.0,Interviewer,It is a hard-- what's the transition process like going from normal guitar to bass guitar?
1394.0,1406.0,Subject,"I mean, it's about the same thing. A lot of guitar-like instruments are the same. They just have different chords or notes and stuff."
1406.0,1411.0,Interviewer,So are the notes on the strings the same?
1411.0,1430.0,Subject,"Not all of them. A bass guitar would only be the top four strings of a six-string guitar. So it's kind of the same thing, just a lower octave."
1430.0,1436.75,Interviewer,"Oh. So it has the top four, but it's just an octave lower?"
1436.75,1437.0,Subject,Yeah.
1437.0,1441.0,Interviewer,"So you won't have the E string, for example?"
1441.0,1442.0,Subject,Yeah.
1442.0,1454.0,Interviewer,"Oh, cool. Interesting. So how does that affect your finger position, that you only have four strings instead of six?"
1454.0,1461.0,Subject,"I don't really know. I mean, I play a guitar and bass the same."
1461.0,1468.0,Interviewer,Your finger position doesn't need to change at the top just because there are four strings?
1468.0,1470.0,Subject,Wait. What?
1470.0,1476.75,Interviewer,"You know how at the top of the guitar, you have to, obviously, put your fingers on the strings in different positions to get the notes?"
1476.75,1477.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
1477.0,1484.0,Interviewer,Can you do the same exact-- if you're trying to play a D chord. Can you do the same thing on the bass and the normal guitar?
1484.0,1485.0,Subject,Yeah.
1485.0,1487.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow."
1487.0,1491.0,Subject,Harder because the bass strings are really thick.
1491.0,1493.0,Interviewer,Oh. So you have to press harder?
1493.0,1495.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
1495.0,1499.0,Interviewer,Interesting. And does it dig into your fingers at all?
1499.0,1501.0,Subject,Yeah. But I have calluses.
1501.0,1518.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's good. Wow. That's so interesting. And is the type of music that you play similar on the bass and on the normal guitar, or do the parts of the songs change a lot?"
1518.0,1525.0,Subject,"Well, they change is [inaudible] or bassline rather than the whole guitar solo or something."
1525.0,1530.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm. So maybe more of a harmony versus melody role?
1530.0,1532.0,Subject,Yeah.
1532.0,1544.0,Interviewer,And how could you see playing bass more incorporate into your recording life?
1544.0,1547.0,Subject,I don't know.
1547.0,1553.0,Interviewer,"Could you do something where you record the bassline, and then you record the guitar over it or something like that?"
1553.0,1555.0,Subject,Yeah. I could.
1555.0,1560.0,Interviewer,What would be involved-- what type of technology would you need to have that work?
1560.0,1565.0,Subject,Just a laptop or computer.
1565.0,1583.0,Interviewer,"Cool. Well, I hope that your-- you get your whatever guitar it is that you want in the future and that you can make some cool music. We're actually up on time, so I'm going to stop the recording if that's okay with you?"
