0.0,6.0,Interviewer,So the first thing that we'll start with is just how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,9.0,Subject,Everything has been going so great for me lately.
9.0,10.0,Interviewer,Really?
10.0,14.0,Subject,Yeah. And it'll continue to go great for me forever.
14.0,15.0,Interviewer,Wow. Forever?
15.0,17.0,Subject,Yeah. Forever.
17.0,19.0,Interviewer,What makes you say that?
19.0,28.0,Subject,Because I know that I'm going to make it to heaven for certain reasons.
28.0,31.0,Interviewer,Which reasons?
31.0,35.0,Subject,"Well, as I told [inaudible], I'm God."
35.0,37.0,Interviewer,Wow.
37.0,45.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't really like to talk about it. But since I already told her that, I'll tell you I'm God. I can prove it even."
45.0,46.0,Interviewer,Wow.
46.0,48.0,Subject,Yeah.
48.0,52.0,Interviewer,How did you come to know this?
52.0,56.0,Subject,Signs. I could even show you the signs on my phone right now.
56.0,57.0,Interviewer,Wow.
57.0,61.0,Subject,Yeah. Some of the signs.
61.0,65.0,Interviewer,Could you just tell us a little bit about the signs?
65.0,104.75,Subject,"Well, if you take the word God, you get G is the 7th letter of the alphabet. Zero is the-- I mean, O is the 15th letter of the alphabet. And D is the 4th letter of the alphabet. You look at those numbers backwards, you get 7154. The 715 is right there in my birth date, 5/17, May 17th. And then the 4 symbolizes-- well, all those numbers added up is 17, by the way. Sorry."
104.75,105.0,Interviewer,That's okay.
105.0,107.0,Subject,It's 17. Yeah.
107.0,109.0,Interviewer,What does 17 mean?
109.0,158.0,Subject,"Well, 17 is probably the luckiest number. It's one and seven. And it's also the day of my birthday. I was born on May 17th. And it symbolizes luck. It symbolizes as number one. It symbolizes being number one and has number seven the number of God that symbolizes luck. I think you know that seven is a lucky number. Yeah. And I have a screenshot on my phone where there's a-- you're not going to tell it to-- this is not going to go public or anything?"
158.0,159.0,Interviewer,No. No.
159.0,313.0,Subject,"Cool. So, yeah, there's a screenshot on my phone that I found. I was scrolling through the internet. There's a screenshot what does the number eight mean? Because the number one and seven equals eight. So I was looking-- it says what does the number eight mean? And, sorry. They took the screen-- they published that post on that blog-- it was a blog post. They published it, I think it was August, which is the eighth number of-- the eighth month, sorry. And one eight, it was-- and the date was the 18th, one eight. And then it was in 2015, which all added up as eight. And then the number of shares on the site-- there was a share-- there was a share for-- I think the Google shares or something were like four. Then the Pinterest shares-- how many people shared it, I mean, was like five or something five or-- and there were four different-- there were four different outlets where people had shared the site-- four different outlets, sorry, where people had shared the site, shared the blog post. Yeah. And on all of those-- the number of shares for each of those four outlets, they equaled 7154, just like the number is in the-- nothing-- in the word God. And I realized that was a special post meant for me. And I took a screenshot-- sorry. And there's a big picture on the blog post that says 888. And then you want to hear another sign?"
313.0,315.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
315.0,348.0,Subject,"Yeah. So the year 2017 is the year of Jubilee, probably, the most famous year and most important year of the Christian religion because I'm Jehovah. I'm God the Father. So it may sound crazy, but I know it’s-- but I know it to be true. Even my father's name-- my father is a very special person--  sorry for feeling my penis."
348.0,350.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk].
350.0,510.0,Subject,"I’m sorry. Even my father his name is Yahweh Elohim. It’s the highest name of the God, Jehovah. He’s a very special man. He has the Holy Spirit. I have the Holy Spirit. And I, maybe, shouldn’t even say that. But his name is Yahweh Elohim-- Elohim, I mean. And that’s like Elohim-- you know that word, right? Yeah. So his name is the most special name of God. And that shows that he has something to do linked with God if he’s bearing God’s-- if he’s bearing God’s holiest name. The Holy Spirit told him to take that name. And the Holy Spirit told me I’m God. Does it still make you worried, though?"
510.0,534.0,Interviewer,"It does make me a little uneasy sometimes I won’t lie because I don't know for-- well, I can’t know for sure-- I can’t know for sure what is going on. I can’t know anything in this body. I do have mild supernatural power. I’ve-- Wow."
534.0,558.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. I’ve healed myself multiple times from colds and stuff. And also, I’ve made things happen like I caused my brother to find the remote. I said, “In three seconds, you’re going to find the remote.” And then I counted-- I said it in my head. I said, “One, two, three.” And he found the remote and I was using the-- you were going to say something?"
558.0,559.0,Interviewer,No.
559.0,584.0,Subject,"Yeah, I was using the techniques that I use to do supernatural things. Sorry. And, yeah. And I’ve done supernatural things through this technique in the past. I’m almost sure it was me who caused the sky to turn blue when I was trying to make the sun come out."
584.0,586.0,Interviewer,When?
586.0,591.0,Subject,That was in 2017. Yeah.
591.0,594.0,Interviewer,Can you tell me a little bit about that time?
594.0,625.0,Subject,"Well, I was standing by the water and it was dark outside. The sky was gray. And then I started using the techniques to try to bring the sun out. Then I looked at-- and then I eventually looked to the sky and then around me. And then the sky-- sorry, the evil inclination is trying to frustrate my words."
625.0,627.0,Interviewer,I’m sorry. That sounds really difficult.
627.0,631.0,Subject,"Yeah. It’s okay. He’s in trouble, man."
631.0,632.0,Interviewer,He’s in trouble?
632.0,665.0,Subject,"Yeah, he’s in trouble. But I can’t get into all of that. He’s in trouble because I’m an [inaudible] messiah. That’s why I’m here-- that’s why I’m here to-- well, I probably shouldn’t talk about that. Yeah, the sky around me turned blue. The sky only around me was blue after a while after I was using the techniques to try to bring the sun out."
665.0,666.0,Interviewer,Where was the sun?
666.0,678.0,Subject,"It was around the-- it was around the shelter, Charles Gay Loop Shelter in Harlem, I believe."
678.0,683.0,Interviewer,"Oh. Okay, got you. How did it feel to be able to do that?"
683.0,747.0,Subject,"It feels so good. It felt so good, I mean. I felt powerful. And my powers will need developing. I’m looking for secret knowledge. I’m trying to get-- my goals are to take over the world, to become the richest being of eternity, and become the most supernaturally powerful being of eternity. I might have another one that I can’t remember right now. I sense that I might. But my powers are developing. I have the technique that people don’t realize-- that people don’t realize it’s out there. I discovered something [inaudible] I made a breakthrough with it and started to heal-- I healed myself of a pretty severe illness at one point. And I’ve healed myself from stuffy noses and stuff like that like instantly."
747.0,748.0,Interviewer,Wow.
748.0,751.0,Subject,"Yeah. And, yeah."
751.0,753.0,Interviewer,You were sick before?
753.0,755.0,Subject,Yeah.
755.0,758.0,Interviewer,How did you heal yourself?
758.0,829.0,Subject,"I used a technique-- I used the technique that I learned-- it was a theory I said-- [I looked at it?] something that people do to cause things to happen. And I said, “What if I can use this to do whatever I want?” And then I tested the theory. And I bought a book on it and-- a secret book, with secret knowledge in it, and it-- nothing. I read it. And then I implemented it with the theory that I had on supernatural things, and it worked. And I was like, “Wow, that’s amazing.” Yeah, as you can see, my name is Joseph Gordon. And Peter Pan is like me-- Peter Pan is like me. That’s why my name is Joseph Gordon, and it sounds like Peter Pan type name. Could you see it?"
829.0,830.0,Interviewer,"A little bit, yeah."
830.0,853.0,Subject,"Yeah. Like if I was all-powerful and I was the name Joseph Gordon-- and my name was Joseph Gordon, would I look like a Peter Pan type of character with somebody like me as a 13-year-old kid in the name-- with the name-- sorry [laughter]. That sounds like a-- yeah, you were going to say something?"
853.0,855.0,Interviewer,No.
855.0,858.0,Subject,"Yeah, that sounds like a Peter Pan type of name, right?"
858.0,860.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, a little bit."
860.0,862.0,Subject,Yeah.
862.0,872.0,Interviewer,You said that you wanted to be the most powerful and the richest being. What does powerful mean to you? What would that look like?
872.0,897.0,Subject,"Well, the most supernaturally powerful-- sorry. Yeah, Satan is frustrating my words-- my words, I mean. Supernaturally powerful, basically, I’ll merge back as being God and go back to heaven. But I’ll do it through a magic technique."
897.0,900.0,Interviewer,And what about when you’re here?
900.0,906.0,Subject,"Well, I’m trying to take over the world."
906.0,912.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what does that look like? What does it mean to take over the world?
912.0,925.0,Subject,"To take over the world, be the president of the whole-- be the king of the whole world and-- be the king of the whole world. Well--"
925.0,928.0,Interviewer,What would you do as king of the world?
951.0,990.0,Subject,"I’ll have the power to do anything. I don't know what I would do with the power, really. I think about it sometimes, and I’m like, “What am I even going to do with all that power?” But it’s good to-- it’s always good to be on the top, though, I believe. There’s probably some things I could do. I’m not going to hurt anybody or anything, but I could make laws and stuff like that. Yeah. Nothing. Yeah."
990.0,994.0,Interviewer,What kind of laws do you think would be good?
994.0,1087.0,Subject,"Legalize prostitution worldwide, legalize people being able to make love to little children because people don’t understand that the Bible is not strict. Satan has tampered with the Bible to make me God look like I’m a strict God. But the thing is the only real law that God wants people to follow is do what you know in your heart is right. That’s why there’s-- the spirit showed me a sign where-- it’s called a scale of right and wrong-- the term scale of right and wrong. The first letters of all those words is so raw. If you add up all the first letters of all those words, I mean, is so raw. And that’s because the rules are so raw. You could do whatever you want. All you have to do is be good. And you could even have sex before marriage-- people don’t know that. And you can have prostitutes, and you can make love to little children. And also, it’s called so raw because the sex is so raw. You could, yeah. [crosstalk]."
1087.0,1088.0,Interviewer,That’s really interesting.
1088.0,1090.0,Subject,Yeah.
1090.0,1091.0,Interviewer,Do you--
1091.0,1094.0,Subject,Thanks [laughter].
1094.0,1101.0,Interviewer,What other kinds of laws do you think would be good to have or what way do you think that the Bible’s been tampered with?
1101.0,1166.0,Subject,"Well, the Bible has been tampered with just little-- I can’t even get into it really because there’s-- in this form, I don't know the little things that Satan planted into the Bible. For instance, they say God shouldn’t have long hair in the Bible. That’s one of them. But the truth is, my father tells me, that’s just the English people, like the white people, they tamper with the Bible with Satan because they didn’t want Gods wearing dreads because they know how powerful dreads are and stuff like that. Maybe, I shouldn’t be talking about it. But it’s all right I believe."
1166.0,1167.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1167.0,1187.0,Subject,"Yeah. And the Father, he’s not black, but, as you can see, the main body he takes-- the main form he takes is black."
1187.0,1193.0,Interviewer,What do you think that means?
1193.0,1235.0,Subject,"I have no idea. I don't know if it means black-- I don't know if it-- I wouldn’t say that it means that blacks are better than anybody or something like that. I just think it means God’s main form is black. I don't know. I’m sorry. Yeah, I don't know. Sorry. I mean, nothing."
1235.0,1247.0,Interviewer,So what do you think your duties are as God?
1247.0,1261.0,Subject,"Well, I’d rather-- well, just to govern everything and mainly just to have fun. Really just only to have fun, really. Yeah."
1261.0,1264.0,Interviewer,So what are you going to do to have fun?
1264.0,1309.0,Subject,"I’m going to get-- I’m going to become the richest being of eternity. Then I have these crazy ideas. You wouldn’t believe these ideas. They’re going to revolutionize the world. I’m sure I’ll probably make at least a billion a day. But I’m pretty sure-- I’m about 97% sure that I’ll make at least a trillion dollars a day. But I’m trying to make like-- if it’s in the world, I’m trying to make like a billion trillion dollars a day. That’s the potential I think I have to make a billion trillions a day."
1309.0,1310.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1310.0,1311.0,Subject,Yeah.
1311.0,1314.0,Interviewer,What are you going to do with all of that money?
1314.0,1334.0,Subject,"Hang out. Do a lot of fun-- nothing. Nothing, I’m sorry. I can’t really talk about it. Yeah."
1334.0,1340.0,Interviewer,Okay. So what kind of things do you do for fun now?
1340.0,1343.0,Subject,Watch YouTube.
1343.0,1344.0,Interviewer,Right?
1344.0,1349.0,Subject,"Yeah. [inaudible] YouTube. Help me [laughter]. No, I’m joking."
1349.0,1352.0,Interviewer,What do you like to watch on YouTube?
1352.0,1357.0,Subject,"No, sorry, I didn’t mean to come at YouTube by the way [laughter]."
1357.0,1358.0,Interviewer,That’s okay.
1358.0,1457.0,Subject,"Yeah. I love YouTube. Yeah. On YouTube, I watch things about the high life. I watch people do the miracles in the name of Jesus. Yeah. I always see people doing miracles. I’ve seen a guy put a handkerchief in his hand, and he closed his hand. And then he opened his hand, but then he told the girl-- he told the girl to-- he told to some people to rub the handkerchief on where their neck feels pain. And then he says, “I’m going to make it-- I’m going to make this handkerchief disappear. And when I make it disappear, your pain is also going to disappear.” Yeah. And he put the handkerchief in his hand, curled his hand into a ball with a consistent shot with the cameras so you see everything. And then he opens his hand and the-- sorry. And the handkerchief was gone, sorry. And the handkerchief is gone, and the pain has left the person. Yeah, I see. Yeah, I see so many miracles on YouTube about people getting healed. And I’ve seen somebody heal a lump on somebody’s shoulder, I mean, sorry, live on camera. Yeah."
1457.0,1459.0,Interviewer,That’s amazing.
1459.0,1461.0,Subject,Yeah.
1461.0,1463.0,Interviewer,Do you think you’ll be able to do that?
1463.0,1478.0,Subject,"Definitely. I know how to-- I know how to get the power. I know how to get the power to do those miracles, but I’m going after something hot and something different than that. Yeah."
1478.0,1488.0,Interviewer,So what do you think the people who can do that-- are they angels? What is their role?
1488.0,1496.0,Subject,"They’re apostles, yeah. Sorry. Yeah."
1496.0,1501.0,Interviewer,And so what are their main jobs?
1501.0,1510.0,Subject,"To heal people, to bring people to God, and stuff like that."
1510.0,1512.0,Interviewer,Very cool.
1512.0,1515.0,Subject,Cool. Thanks. 
1515.0,1522.0,Interviewer,And so when did you start to feel all of this? The power of God?
1522.0,1710.0,Subject,"Well, when I was 17, I thought I was going crazy or something because I used to see signs in the Bible, stupid little signs that shouldn’t happen-- not stupid signs, but things that didn’t seem to mean anything. I thought I was maybe-- I used to think I was the reincarnation on Joseph. And sometimes, I used to think I was God. And then it seemed like it really meant anything. I even thought I was overexaggerating because I had turned to God, and I was reading the Bible and stuff like that. And then I turned away from God. I went down a very evil path. I probably was the most evil person I’ve heard of. I was trying to kill so many people for eternity for nothing. It was not a [inaudible]. I was trying to be the baddest person-- I was trying to be the baddest being of eternity, pretty much because I thought it was the way to go. I thought it was the right thing. I looked at the lions in the world, and I thought, “Yeah, these lions just rip people to shreds,” and they’re nature. So I figured this world, we’re supposed to be evil. I thought people were supposed to be evil, so I went down the evil path. And then, eventually, I did some soul searching. And then I found out that-- and then found out-- sorry. I found out that I’m not really a bad person. I’m, actually, extremely benevolent and-- nothing, sorry. Yeah, in the year 2017-- yeah, Satan is trying to frustrate my words. Yeah, sorry. In the year 2017-- nothing, I turned to God. And that’s why in the year of Jubilee, like I told you, I think that was the significance of that 17 being in the middle of the calendar like that because God turned to God. And that’s when I became good. I became good in the year 2017. And then I started to get all kinds of signs. When it was Harry Potter’s birthday, I started realizing things about the name Harry Potter and its connections to me. Because if you take the name Joseph - that’s my name Joseph - you spell it backwards, you get H-P-S-O-J and that means-- and that’s like Harry Potter. I’m told it means Harry Potter is so J-- Harry Potter is so me and also a higher power is so me. Yeah. Yeah."
1710.0,1715.0,Interviewer,Wow. Do you like Harry Potter?
1715.0,1737.0,Subject,"Yeah. But I think it has flaws in it-- I think it has a lot of flaws in it. But [inaudible]-- well, I’m not going to get into all that. I like Harry Potter-- I like Harry Potter, but there’s this thing going on with Harry Potter and-- well, I’m not going to get into that. Sorry. Yeah."
1737.0,1744.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And so how do you think you guys are similar, then?"
1744.0,1854.75,Subject,"Because I came from the bottom-- I came from the bottom. Everybody used to hate me and stuff like that. And I used to be the little-- when I was a kid, I was the most hated kid in the school, probably. And I rose and I kept rising to the top. I eventually became the class clown in eighth grade, and I was the coolest kid in the school. And then, eventually, I became the coolest kid in high school-- yeah, I was the coolest kid in high school. And people didn’t like me. The so-called cool kids, they didn’t-- I don’t mean they’d say, “So-called cool kids.” But I don’t mean to do the quotes [laughter]. Yeah. But the so-called cool kids hated me. But I was cooler than them. I was the only kid in the school-- I had the coolest sneakers in the school. I had all-white Diadoras. There’s this hood sneaker called Diadoras. Nobody knew about it-- nobody really knew about it in those days. The cool kids knew about it, but I was the only one in the school with the all-white ones. I was the only one who’d probably even heard of all-white ones. And when Diesel-- you know Diesel, right? When Diesel first came out, I was the only one in the school with the all-black and [patent?] leather Diesels. Nobody even knew what they were, probably. Yeah. And I was just like-- I was like the sigma make of the school. You know what a sigma male is?"
1854.75,1855.0,Interviewer,No.
1855.0,1979.0,Subject,"It’s like the lone wolf. Yeah. And then, eventually, I rose to the top-- well, eventually, I started having a dream to becoming the richest being of eternity and the most powerful being of eternity and take over the world. And then I found out that I was God in 2017. Nothing. And I started getting supernatural powers. Somebody told me I was an angel-- never mind, nothing. But I don’t feel I should talk about that. Well, somebody told me I was an angel. A person of God-- and my father who knows about my father and stuff like that. And he’s a close friend of my father. And he’s a really special person who has the Holy Spirit. He said the Holy Spirit-- he said I was an angel. And an angel is-- what an angel is is-- all angels are Gods. So he didn’t say it, but he-- he didn’t say this-- sorry. That’s Satan, he’s trying to frustrate me to make me look stupid, probably. But I think he was-- I think he knows that I’m God too. And my father called me by the name Hashem. He said this Holy Spirit told me to take the name Hashem-- told me to use the name Hashem, sorry. And the name Hashem is-- you might have heard of it. Have you ever heard of the name Hashem?"
1979.0,1980.0,Interviewer,No.
1980.0,1988.0,Subject,"Yeah. It’s a name of God. It’s the name of Jehovah, meaning the name."
1988.0,1990.0,Interviewer,I see.
