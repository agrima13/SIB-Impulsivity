0.0,5.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,48.0,Subject,"Lately? I want to say hectic mostly because of home life and trying to get my future all set up. Sorry. Been not hanging around too much with friends. I've been more to myself again. I've also cut my hair. Yeah, that's pretty much about it, just staying to myself, so."
48.0,50.0,Interviewer,Staying to yourself?
50.0,77.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm not too worried about other people. Haven't been hanging out with my friends. I mean, I kind of cut out a lot of people even though they didn't do anything, but I just really like having my own solitude, so I think of rather being alone than with people."
77.0,79.0,Interviewer,You'd rather be alone?
79.0,101.0,Subject,"Yup. Yeah, I'm not really a people person, per se. And I really don't like living in New York City because it's a lot of people. Yeah. I think that's kind of weird [laughter]."
101.0,102.0,Interviewer,What's weird?
102.0,167.0,Subject,"Just being not a people person, but yeah. I've also been home playing games and waiting for an email because I applied to a program. It's called Job Corps. I was supposed to go to Massachusetts for the program on this thing. There was a site called Shriver, which would help me get a high-school diploma and get a job, too. I've heard that they were full, so my guidance counselor had contacted me about that, and then she told me she will be putting in the papers for the one in south Bronx, which isn't too far, but also kind of far. Ever since, I've been waiting and playing games, so."
167.0,172.0,Interviewer,What do you think you'll be doing?
172.0,190.0,Subject,"The class is-- well, they call it trades because obviously it's a trade, was computer science, but there was another one, which I didn't think was a trade, called Homeland Security. So I've also been interested in that, too. Yeah."
190.0,192.0,Interviewer,What's interesting to you about it?
192.0,297.0,Subject,"Homeland Security-- I want to say what you can get into in terms of the divisions or rather branches of it like FBI, CIA. I just am fascinated about that because even though I'm not really-- I want to say I'm one for justice. I am for somewhat order, and if order is out of phase, then something has to be done about it. And that irks me when there's too much chaos and not enough order when there should be more order implemented. And then you have all these events happening because it's too chaotic and nothing's being done about it, and everybody is too scared to do something about it. I don't know why. And I feel like-- well, in my interpretation, I feel like nobody wants to lose anything, but that's not how life is. Something has to be lost in order to progress, in my opinion, from my understanding of the whole world history. Sacrifices have to be made so the changes can happen, where if it's good or bad and no one's going to know the actual outcome. And I feel like since everyone doesn't know the actual outcome because, well, you can't really predict the future unless, I suppose, you manifest-destiny it, no one's going to know, so they're scared of that, but."
297.0,306.0,Interviewer,So what do you think makes order so important to you?
306.0,474.0,Subject,"So important to me? I want to say order, it's just a necessity because truly there's not really any absolute good or bad because those are just subjective terms, rather. One person's good could be another person's bad, and no matter how ""good"" you are, you're always going to be a villain to somebody. It's just different views, but order is something that really can't be - I want to say - debated. Even though there can be different views of order, it's all preventing chaotic-- it's somewhat like good and bad, but it has its own, I guess, personality to it. And why it's so important to me is because it's just to keep balance of things, like of the whole cosmos, if you will, because obviously, what you put out into the world, the universe eats, if you believe so. It takes. I believe that it's a living entity because it's enough to just come out of nowhere from since the beginning of time and just make things on its own. And even in science, if one thing was off, the whole universe will be off. And so let's say like the earth wasn't here when it was supposed to be made, things could be a lot different. We could be on a different planet, different beings of shape or sizes, different laws of physics. And I believe that since we're given so much chaotic energy, it's eating it up and making the universe more chaotic itself, like having asteroids or another black hole appearing out of nowhere, Hawking radiation just blipping and disappearing without any real answer to even know. We're fairly new to the universe, but ever since we've been studying it, there hasn't been something that was-- I want to say something that is normal because it just doesn't happen like that. But we're all so new. But I believe that order, if there is enough, it can set things right for a minimal time."
474.0,487.0,Interviewer,"And what do you think is-- what do you think the right thing is, like what, ideally, does order make right?"
487.0,542.0,Subject,"Personally to me, order-- humans, or well, yeah, human beings as general should be - I want to say - more compassionate because no, that's not how things work. I want to say there should be a fine line when-- it's kind of hard because there's so many flaws in it, too, and it's just kind of hard to say. Everything has flaws. But if order-- what was the question again, because I'm really trying to think about it?"
542.0,548.0,Interviewer,What do you think order can bring us? What is the right-- you said it can make everything right.
548.0,646.0,Subject,"I feel like it can be this progression, but that what makes it right, what right thing could it be? I'm not truly sure. In my own vices, I believe that-- it's kind of cruel to say, but not everyone matters, if you know what I mean. Sure, people matter to different people in their own lives, but some people exist to be like sheep. They just walk about mindlessly, which we've seen tons of people do constantly. And there's more of that than people who are actually thinking and think that they exist or believe that they exist or know that they exist. And with order, we can try to cut down on the whole zombified mindset, or the sheepish mindset. That's one thing I believe that would set things right. Yeah. That's just at least one belief."
646.0,648.0,Interviewer,That's really interesting. 
648.0,649.0,Subject,Yeah.
649.0,654.0,Interviewer,It sounds like this is something that you've been thinking a lot about.
654.0,768.0,Subject,"I mean, for a while. It's been picked up and dropped so many times by me, the ideal of it, because it's a little inhuman just to say some people aren't, like they don't matter. Then if you really look at it, people are throwing their lives away for no real reason, not ever even trying to fix their lives. They just want to somehow die and think that will fix it, which to me, sure, go ahead. I don't really care in that degree. Like if someone went to kill themselves, even if it's my own family member, to me, you're dying, where rather you can fix your life. And there's other people's lives that are trying to fight to have that exact life. Even if it's not the perfect life, people are still trying to fight for it. And you're-- not you, but in general, people are throwing their lives away so easily, when it can be all fixed through time, but it's just the willpower. And it angers me so because there's just so many people who are just easily throwing their lives away. Sure, it may be because of bullying, but you can always-- people always have a choice, and they can always stand up. And the whole mindset of I can is because it's manifested this condition into them. And it sounds really pathetic because you can just tell yourself, ""I can do it,"" and it would work just the same. That's why some of these people fight to have those lives, even though it's not perfect."
768.0,776.0,Interviewer,"Has there been something that you have thought, ""I can do it,"" even though it was hard?"
776.0,810.0,Subject,"Yeah, a few times, me going to school, for the most part, but even though I didn't want to go, but I know in the end I had to go. Sometimes even I would stay home, but then again, I wouldn't say I felt guilty, or even regret. More like, ""Yeah, I should have went, but it doesn't really matter,"" until I dropped out [laughter], but for more important reasons than that."
810.0,812.0,Interviewer,More important?
812.0,930.0,Subject,"And yeah, my own mental health. I believe my own health is important than what the high schools teach because, for whatever reason, I don't believe that what is being taught is truly the truth. I want to say it's the truth, but also mixed-in lies, kind of like propagandaish. And so that's why school never really mattered that much to me, but it only mattered because of, well, you want the ""good career."" You have to have a high-school diploma. You have to have x, y, z, which kind of bothers me, but it's whatever. I don't see why school should be the whole end-all be-all if you can adapt to learning, which you're always learning. Even if you dropped out, if you can speak English or whatever language it may be, and you're fluent, and you're able to be astute, resilient, then that should tell you something. They should tell the employee or whoever it may be something that, ""Oh, wait. You're not dumb,"" which is often the case of people who drop out. They're not really dumb. It's just that school is either boring or it's just not helping. And there's tons of people who are geniuses and that had dropped out - Einstein, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates. There's a lot of people. Even Isaac Newton wasn't in school, or he didn't really go to college, but he found inertia. Einstein found relativity, right? It's things like that. But I feel like-- yeah, I honestly feel like school is a waste of time [laughter]. All you do is just regurgitate information like you're really learning. You're learning how to regurgitate. That's about it."
930.0,947.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So what do you see on the horizon for yourself? So you are trying to do the trade program, but where does that lead after?"
947.0,965.0,Subject,"Where does that lead? Well, either me being a politician of some sort or an agent of Homeland Security, whether it be CIA or FBI or DEA, FDA, something of the sort, so. Yeah."
965.0,966.0,Interviewer,"And-- yeah, go ahead."
966.0,988.0,Subject,"Oh, so I was going to say that I know, I think, one of these things I'm going to have be in. I'm not just going to settle for less. I have to try really hard to-- or not really hard, but I have to put enough effort and willpower to make these things happen just to manifest it, so."
988.0,994.0,Interviewer,And so what do you want to do there?
994.0,1076.0,Subject,"I want to do that where if I become a politician, I want to change so many things. I kind of want to be the Julius Caesar of this era because there's just a lot of shit going haywire, and it's just not, I don't believe-- I'm all for capitalism, but this isn't the way when there's so many flaws and it's been flawed for countless years, like hundreds of years. And people say, ""Oh, America is great, yeah. So what's wrong?"" And look how that ended, so. I just want to break down the whole ideal of three-branch government. Something's got to change. Some civilizations have to fall, well, not some, but all. And so to me, what's all that's happening, it's just making me more wanting to become a politician just to crumble the whole mechanic of it all. And if I'm not the one to do it, then I'm going to have someone, a predecessor, or not a predecessor, because I would be the predecessor, but a successor, so."
1076.0,1086.0,Interviewer,And what do you want to see in its place?
1086.0,1252.0,Subject,"I mean, I kind of want a monarchy, kind-of-ish. Then again, I know that if all this happens out of-- I know it might not happen. It's most likely not to happen, at least in my hands. But if it did happen while I was still alive and still doing that, I'd be a tyrant [laughter], or be seen as one, even though I'm willing to do a lot of bad things so good things can happen, kind of like Thanos in Marvel, right, where he's like, ""Oh, it's all worth it because, hey, it's going to set the universe in balance."" But, I mean, was he really wrong, though, because his life, or not his life, but his race was extinct, and he tried telling them the nice way, out of countless races it went extinct because he tried helping, but it just wasn't going that way. So sometimes you've just really got to put the bad things that you have, even though bad is typically seen as something you shouldn't do, but it's what's needed because more often times than not, bad things help progress things. If you think if you didn't have wars, would you really believe we'd be a social power, like a world power? Because we were one of the last countries to actually hop in the war, and if, let's say, Hitler didn't go into Russia and pull a Napolean Bonaparte, you think the world would be the same [laughter]? A lot of bad things have to happen, and it's just needed. It's a necessity. It contradicts my whole order and chaos, but as with the old saying, ""Order invites chaos and chaos invites order,"" so. And I really want to crumble this whole government. I want in its place, yeah, a monarchy, or I don't want to say the royalty, but someone who's worthy to take control, not easily influenced by greed or power and knows the decision that has to be made, even if it's a bad one, materialistic."
1252.0,1258.0,Interviewer,Do you think materialism and greed are the biggest problems we have?
1258.0,1276.0,Subject,"Yeah, for sure, because at the end of the day, it's really who has the power. And everybody wants to be strong, but not all of us can be, so. "
1276.0,1288.0,Interviewer,"When did you come to realize this, that our biggest problem was greed and materialism?"
1288.0,1340.0,Subject,"I want to say since I was a child because, for whatever reason, I was really too self-aware as a child. I just noticed a lot of things. Even though I was, during that whole - I want to say - childhood era of my life was turmoil, hectic, and things that no regular kid should have been going through, it opened my eyes to how real the world can get, so. And when my parents would always love watching the news, so I would have to watch either way because that was the only way to pass time. And I started understanding-- sorry. Need tissue."
1340.0,1344.0,Interviewer,Let me run.
1344.0,1429.0,Subject,"Right. I was forced even to watch the news if I even wanted to pass time, and that's when I just started realizing because kids-- it's fascinating. They absorb things so easily compared to-- as you're older, you're not as prone to absorb things easily. And so you can easily indoctrinate a child much like an animal. You can force it to be conditioned. And even as a child, it's just so easy to learn. It can even possibly corrupt. It's easier to corrupt a good kid than a person who's old and good because they'll be stubborn to being that way since that's all they know. But yeah, I started realizing when I was a child. I don't know why. I feel like it was a calling. I feel like it was a calling or a whim."
1429.0,1441.0,Interviewer,And that's interesting. Did you ever feel like anybody tried to correct you as a kid?
1441.0,1546.0,Subject,"In more ways than one, but that's uncomfortable. I know that when I was a child, I wasn't really a good child. I was quiet, but I did a lot of bad things. I remember one time, too, that my mom got freaked out because she took us to see-- well, rather me, because I was an only child then. But she took me to see Jurassic Park. And you know the scene where the T-rex bites off that guy's head? I laughed at that part way too, I guess, energetically [laughter], and she got spooked [laughter]. And everyone was just looking at her, from how I was told, and they were side-eyeing. But yeah, there was also-- I used to be a bully in Kindergarten. It makes me laugh [laughter] because I don't-- I don't know, I don't feel guilty about it, but at the same time, I mean, I probably shouldn't have been a bully, but who cares? That was Kindergarten. Who's going to get depressed about some past that some kid got bullied when they were five and they were also five? Kids are kids. Yeah. I was also way to smart for my own thinking. I read seventh-grade books when I was in second grade. My mom was surprised, too, on that one. But yeah. Did I answer the question?"
1546.0,1547.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm. 
1547.0,1549.0,Subject,Okay.
1549.0,1552.0,Interviewer,Do you like reading?
1552.0,1553.0,Subject,Yeah.
1553.0,1554.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
1554.0,1558.0,Subject,"I mean, for the longest moment, I did, but then I strayed away from that as soon as I started really getting into gaming, and then I also got back into reading not too long ago."
1558.0,1572.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]. Okay. [inaudible]. We do [inaudible]. I'm just recording. [inaudible]. Sorry.
1572.0,1573.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
1573.0,1582.0,Interviewer,"Okay. But yeah, I enjoy reading. What kinds of things do you read?"
1582.0,1605.0,Subject,"I want to say mythical things to science fiction to fantasy to allegories like Divine Comedy, epic poems like Gilgamesh, Odyssey and the Iliad, one of my favorites, too."
1605.0,1606.0,Interviewer,Why is that?
1606.0,1700.0,Subject,"The whole idea of adventure and voyage onto the sea. I enjoy the ocean. I don't know why, but I really like the ocean. I like water. I like being in water. It just feels soothing, and so. And I also like trials and rather, I want to say, tests, if you will, like being put through things to see how one would prevail. And so the Odyssey, it was just if a man gets lost on the sea because he's going to war, but then once he finishes the war, he's also struck with-- I want to say-- I want to say a curse, but the gods were just really not happy [laughter]. And so it would take a longer voyage just to go back home and then meet Sirens and all the types of things at the end just to get home. And then he prevailed somewhat. It's kind of crazy. I also haven't read that book in a while. I should read it again. I also enjoy Divine Comedy, the whole idea of one repenting by going through the nine circles of hell, having a poet help you whom you repent to. It's pretty nice."
1700.0,1701.0,Interviewer,Nice?
1701.0,1703.0,Subject,Yeah.
