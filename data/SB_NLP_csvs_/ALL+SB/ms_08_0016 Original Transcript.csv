1.0,6.0,Interviewer,The first question I'm going to ask you is how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,15.0,Subject,"Yeah, not so great, to be honest. I kind of, yeah-- should I go into detail, or--?"
15.0,17.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, tell me about it."
17.0,108.0,Subject,"Okay. Yeah, I just kind of, I guess, as it's called, sort of hit a bottom. Yeah, I mean, I just-- yeah, I'm pretty upset about how things are going. I'm not really able to work very effectively, and feel like I don't have very many friends. And my behavior has kind of pushed a lot of people away and offended people. And I think I've missed kind of opportunities and chances, and it feels like a lot of people are kind of done with me. And so it feels very lonely, so I have to-- yeah, so. And yeah, it's not going very well at the moment. Yeah, I feel like I'm kind of addicted to technology and am not really doing what I would like to be doing-- or I don't feel very productive or kind of healthy, and feel pretty depressed. And yeah, I feel like I-- yeah, yeah."
108.0,124.0,Interviewer,"Oh, it sounds like there's a lot going on. I'm sorry. So you mentioned a couple things. When you say that people seem done with you, what does that mean?"
124.0,165.0,Subject,"Just that I've kind of offended some people and, oh, behaved in ways that are not appropriate or ideal or really healthy and not shown up for people, and yeah. And now it feels like I've just kind of lost some hope, I guess."
165.0,173.0,Interviewer,And what do you think led to kind of these events that you mentioned?
173.0,223.0,Subject,"Other people and how my behavior affects others, yeah, and not asking for help, not telling the truth, trying to go about life kind of on my own and being kind of too afraid to do certain things that I think would-- I don't know. A lot of fear, and yeah."
223.0,229.0,Interviewer,What do you think is making you fearful in that way?
229.0,253.0,Subject,"Just that things won't work out and that I've kind of messed my life up for good, yeah, and that I'm not going to get what I want."
253.0,256.0,Interviewer,What do you want?
256.0,298.0,Subject,"Well, for one thing, I'd like to have a relationship at some point. Iâ€™d like to be playing music and writing music and playing and performing and to be happy and to have friends, yeah, and just to be creative and to be kind of stable and healthy and able to show up for people and to have friends, and yeah."
298.0,312.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And so what do you think is kind of special about a relationship? Why is that something that you really want right now? It was the first thing that I think you said.
312.0,355.0,Subject,"Yeah. Maybe that's not really realistic at the moment, but just because I feel lonely and, yeah, I would like to experience love. But maybe it's not the right-- maybe I need to work on myself a little bit more. I don't know. But yeah, because I feel lonely and depressed, and maybe I think that would help. But maybe that's not really realistic, so."
355.0,363.0,Interviewer,So what do you mean when you say work on yourself? What does that look like?
363.0,440.0,Subject,"Kind of become a little bit happier on my own so that I have something to offer rather than being kind of a mess. And so if I can kind of, I guess-- yeah, for example, my music. Get my music together, play and record and try to have some traction there. And then that will allow me to get outside of myself a little bit more, so I can be more kind of available for people, and so I'm not so kind of-- so I'm able to show up for people, so I'm available, so I have some confidence and I'm not so troubled, and yeah."
440.0,447.0,Interviewer,You said troubled. What do you think makes you feel the most troubled?
447.0,514.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, a lot of fear and disappointment. And I had opportunities that I have squandered. I had relationships that I have ruined. I had chances that I kind of just screwed up. I had opportunities to have positive events in my life, and I feel like I missed those opportunities. And I'm upset about that, and then I'm also, yeah, not really working and feel kind of disconnected from my job. I mean, I technically have a job, but I don't. I kind of take advantage of them and I don't work very often, or I haven't been lately. So that's a problem, so."
514.0,518.0,Interviewer,Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
518.0,594.0,Subject,"Sure. Well, the job is pretty much I just kind of copy and paste articles for this newspaper. And it's like an aggregate, these articles. And yeah, I mean, so there's little accountability and it's very relaxed, and it's like, ""Oh, they don't know,"" and not to make excuses - I know it's an excuse - but no one's kind of checking on me on a daily basis, and it's a pretty low-pressure environment. So for example, today I woke up at like 10:30 or 10:45, and I have worked for about an hour today. And so that's a problem because it's dishonest, and it's also a lot of kind of time where-- yeah, if that makes sense."
594.0,599.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And so what else have you been up to today?
599.0,627.0,Subject,"I went to a meeting for a 12-step group. I cooked some food. I did some writing. I ate food. I can't really say I cooked, but. And I showered. I haven't done much."
627.0,629.0,Interviewer,What have you been writing?
629.0,645.0,Subject,"I just journaled for a little bit, like 10, 15 minutes. And yeah, I played a little guitar, but yeah."
645.0,649.0,Interviewer,So what's it like to journal?
649.0,694.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's great. I've always loved writing, and it always feels good. It kind of gets me outside of myself, and it allows me to see my thoughts a little bit and express myself. And I mean, I love writing, and journaling's great. It kind of turns the volume down on my thoughts and everything and helps me think a little bit more clearly. Yeah, and I try to-- yeah, I try to practice some guitar every day and work on a song every day."
694.0,707.0,Interviewer,That sounds great. So you've told me a little bit about how music seems important to you. What are your kind of goals with your music?
707.0,733.0,Subject,"Yeah, to be a professional musician, to be writing songs and to be performing and recording music. And yeah, so to be a very successful musician."
733.0,740.0,Interviewer,And what kind of music do you write and record?
740.0,762.0,Subject,"Do I write and record? Just songs, like words and lyrics, my guitar, me playing guitar. Sort of like folk rock songs, yeah."
762.0,773.0,Interviewer,"Awesome. And what do you think draws you to that field, to music?"
773.0,862.0,Subject,"The sound of music. It's a way to connect with others. There aren't rules. It's unstructured. It's fun. It exists in a different-- I don't know. Feels like a different experience level than normal reality. It's kind of an escape. And it's expressive; I like the idea of saying something, and I like stories, and I like moving. And I like performing. I probably like the attention. And yeah, it's subtle, and yeah."
862.0,873.0,Interviewer,That all sounds great. And you said it kind of helps you escape a little bit. What do you think about it allows you to do that?
873.0,931.0,Subject,"I think a lot less when I'm playing, yeah, because I can just play, and there's no thinking. It's kind of intuitive, and there's a freedom. I can just write a story or write some words and put them to music, and there's no one to tell me it's wrong. It's like my own environment, my own world that I have that I can-- yeah."
931.0,940.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you think outside of music that you are told that you're wrong?
940.0,955.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, I do. Or just like there's-- yeah. Should I elaborate, or--?"
955.0,956.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, please."
956.0,1042.0,Subject,"Okay. Well, yeah, I mean, there's so much criticism. And I live in New York. There's a lot of criticism in the world. And I feel like there's a lot of animosity and negativity and just kind of-- yeah, and I don't have very many friends, and I live alone. And I feel like because I'm very much kind of a work in progress that a lot of the conversations that I have are sort of about me. Maybe that's part of the issue. But when it is about me, it feels very critical. But that could be-- I don't know. There's a lot of work I need to do on myself, so."
1042.0,1050.0,Interviewer,Who are you having these conversations with that you feel are kind of critically--?
1050.0,1117.0,Subject,"Yeah, well, I mentioned I went to a 12-step meeting today. So the people who support me in those groups are called sponsors. And so I have conversations with sponsors, and even if they're not overtly or critical, it's a very-- for example, I've been sober for a few years, and I haven't sponsored anyone, and I feel very guilty about that, that I haven't given back enough. And so that's an obvious kind of point of criticism, and yeah. And then I don't know. People on the sidewalk. And I don't know. I haven't been to therapy in two months because my therapist is on vacation, so that could be part of the problem, but yeah."
1117.0,1123.0,Interviewer,"When you're on the street, do you people say things to you, or is it something you perceive?"
1123.0,1133.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's more perception and reading into-- yeah, yeah."
1133.0,1141.0,Interviewer,And do you think that you'd be interested in sponsoring someone eventually?
1141.0,1143.0,Subject,"Yeah, of course."
1143.0,1154.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, so what is that like? What do you think is important about that aspect of it?"
1154.0,1208.0,Subject,"Just because I think it would get me outside of myself a little bit and allow me to give back. And it would probably give me some self-esteem, because I've gotten so much from these programs, and I haven't really given back entirely. So yeah, it would probably get me outside of myself so I wouldn't be thinking about myself so much. And to just think of someone other than me would probably-- and it would probably just have a positive impact on my self-esteem and confidence."
1208.0,1211.0,Interviewer,Do you feel like you have trouble with those areas?
1211.0,1221.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah. And it would probably help with my anxiety and help me relax a little bit."
1221.0,1228.0,Interviewer,What do you think are the main reasons that you feel anxious and unrelaxed?
1228.0,1258.0,Subject,"Fear that I'm not going to be okay, that things aren't going to work out, of what other people think of me, of not being liked, of not being successful. It's mostly fear and insecurity and just kind of feeling uncomfortable in my skin."
1258.0,1283.0,Interviewer,And uncomfortable in your own skin's an interesting kind of phrase. I wonder what makes you feel the most uncomfortable in your skin? What's making that kind of a reality for you?
1283.0,1397.0,Subject,"Yeah, probably self-hatred, reflecting on my past, feeling disappointed, feeling disappointed in myself, feeling upset with myself about my choices and how I've failed, and just a general kind of lack of-- I'm just not sure of myself. I know what the answers-- I know what the answers are, but I mean, doing the action is kind of a different-- is a different story. And so yeah, fear about my past being-- fear of not getting over what I feel like I've been through, fear of what others think, fear of not being successful, fear of not getting what I want, fear of being alone, fear of dying, fear of using or drinking again, yeah, and just specifically really what others think. I feel so uncomfortable going-- because I feel like I've acted out in a lot of environments, so I feel very uncomfortable going into certain spaces again, and yeah."
1397.0,1402.0,Interviewer,Can you kind of give me a sense of what you mean by acting out?
1402.0,1483.0,Subject,"Sure, yeah. Yeah, there was someone in one of these fellowships that I was-- there were one person in particular that I was interested in, and I kind of was a bit-- sort of expressed my interest in a kind of public way and was kind of rude at these meetings. I showed up late. I left early. I didn't talk to anyone. I had a kind of strange demeanor, and yeah. And I feel embarrassed. I don't want people to think of me as a deviant, as morally depraved, as an outcast. And so I brought this person coffee. She wasn't at the meetings. That's the kind of-- that's acting out. And then approaching people who are new in the program; that's inappropriate, and a lot of people are not happy, and rightfully so. That's completely out of line. So that's what I mean by acting out."
1483.0,1492.0,Interviewer,And what do you think kind of made you do that?
1492.0,1538.0,Subject,"All that stuff? I mean, desire, compulsive. I'm also an addict, so I mean, I could say that it's part of my addiction. It's like a desire to have a companion or have a friendship or a relationship, very impulsively and just a lack of awareness and a knowledge of how to behave properly, and yeah."
1538.0,1562.0,Interviewer,"It sounds like there's a lot of fear in you. And have you ever had an instance where you've been able to kind of conquer the fear, or what are some of the things that you try to tell yourself and try to employ to minimize the fear?"
1562.0,1589.0,Subject,"Yeah, the steps in the fellowships that I've described help with the fear. And exercise, yeah. Talking about it helps with the fear."
1589.0,1593.0,Interviewer,Yeah? How do you think that works?
1593.0,1607.0,Subject,"I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. I guess mostly the steps."
1607.0,1609.0,Interviewer,So what are the steps?
1609.0,1640.0,Subject,"Well, the fear is I write out what I'm afraid of, and I kind of diagram what I'm afraid of, why I'm afraid of it, and kind of what I can do about it and how I created the fear in the first place. And then I share that with another person, and that helps kind of alleviate the fear."
1640.0,1655.0,Interviewer,So sharing it helps you alleviate it. That's interesting. So who do you normally-- who are you able to share these things with?
1655.0,1667.0,Subject,"My sponsors, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So yeah."
1667.0,1682.0,Interviewer,"And we kind of touched a little bit on this a few minutes ago, but what is it like to have all that fear? What is that experience like?"
1682.0,1732.0,Subject,"I mean, when I'm in it, it feels debilitating. It's a pretty sad, boring way to live, to be constantly worried about-- to be constantly in someone else's mind, to be constantly worried about what others think, to be always worried and never really doing anything, just like a feverish, self-centered, [Claude?], as someone said."
1732.0,1734.0,Interviewer,[Claude?]?
1734.0,1755.0,Subject,"A [Claude?], yeah. It's just this quote from someone. But yeah, it's not really living. It doesn't really feel like I'm living. Yeah, yeah."
1755.0,1759.0,Interviewer,So it doesn't feel like you're living; what does it feel like you're doing then?
1759.0,1818.0,Subject,"Just like kind of surviving or dying or existing, yeah. Yeah, it feels like I'm lying, running around, cheating the system, consuming, stealing, keeping what's been given to me without giving it away. And it feels like I'm not breathing, like I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing, what I'm here to do."
1818.0,1822.0,Interviewer,What do you think you are supposed to be doing or here to do?
1822.0,1861.0,Subject,"Yeah, I mean, play music and write and perform and make things and be a member of society and have friendships and have relationships and, yeah, play music and write and give and be available for people and, yeah, participate in the world."
1861.0,1867.0,Interviewer,"Well, it sounds like you've given it a lot of thought and you're really trying, so that's a great [start?]."
