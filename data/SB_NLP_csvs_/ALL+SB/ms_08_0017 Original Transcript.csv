1.0,5.0,Interviewer,Okay. So the first question I start with is just how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,63.0,Subject,"Hold on. I want to move out of these settings. I'm sorry. I'm in the settings. I just realized I want to see you. Okay. Great. So how are things going for me? They are not going great because I am not doing well at work, and my parents are high-risk. My dad has a lot of health problems. They're older. So I got all kinds of issues. I feel like I have more cons in my life than pros right now, but I definitely feel like I'm very privileged in many ways - many, many ways - so I really shouldn't complain. But it's our life. It's our issues are prominent. So it's hard to put that in perspective. So that's how I'm doing."
63.0,67.0,Interviewer,"What do you mean, our issues?"
67.0,82.0,Subject,"Our personal issues. When I have a personal issue, in perspective to other people’s issues, it’s not a big deal, but because it’s my life, then it’s amplified."
82.0,104.0,Interviewer,"And so you mentioned a lot of kind of things going on in your life, and this is already a very kind of tumultuous life for a lot of us. What do you think are the things that are kind of contributing most significantly to your kind of load?"
104.0,278.0,Subject,"I think work weighs the heaviest right now, and that's because it's my job and it's my livelihood and I'm used to a certain-- I maintain a certain cost of living, especially when that's really difficult here in New York, and I really don't want to live anywhere else right now. I'd probably do better somewhere else, but now is also not a time to uproot. But I think that that's the heaviest load, because it impacts everything about my life. And then along with my dad's health; obviously, that's most important than a job almost, or it is. But I think that those things are the heaviest. And then I have relationship stuff too. I'm an open book. I'll talk about anything. I'll talk about my life in great detail, so feel free to stop me anywhere. I feel like it's a little self-indulgent, but I could talk forever. But yeah, I think that the issues with my work-- I have a lot of-- in addition to the mental health issues or along with mental health issues or in alignment, I do have ADD and I have some cognitive difficulties and executive function issues, deficits. And so those bring a lot of challenges to my work, especially lately. It just doesn't feel like I'm all the way there, or I'm not focused properly. I get a lot of feedback from my boss of things that I should already know or think about, and I just don't. So I really struggle, and it doesn't feel good when your boss is constantly telling you that you're doing things wrong, or just to feel dumb. Especially because the rest of my team really pulls their weight and I don't. And then on top of that, it's like I really need this job to live. I will be completely fucked otherwise. I will have to move back to Georgia where my parents live. And even though I love spending time with them, mentally it would not be a good fit. And additionally, it would just be a really depressing environment because my parents aren't doing well, and it's hard to be around them. But you'd think I'd want to be around them more, but really I need a little bit of boundaries and keep them a little at arm's length because of that, because they're not going to change their behavior or ways. So my job is most pressing, in my opinion, right now. It's really the most difficult issue that I deal with every single day."
278.0,303.0,Interviewer,"Absolutely. So what is it like to feel-- you said you kind of feel like everyone on your team is doing well, and it's frustrating for you to be told by your boss these things. Can you tell me a little bit more about what that's like and what that's been like for you if you've had it for a while?"
303.0,546.0,Subject,"With the mental health/ADD stuff and things like that? Well, I've probably had it my whole life, but it seems to be getting progressively worse. So I had some testing done, which is how I know that I have these issues, and I think that it's really just since maybe past two years ago, or maybe I just didn't have a job that was so complex that I needed all these skills and my brain to work at 200%. It's very difficult. It's embarrassing, really. I have a lot of shame because everybody else is quick, and they get it, and I really struggle with how to respond. And I know that some of this has to do with-- this study has to do with language or cognitive stuff, and I really struggle with being able to articulate myself in responses. I just get so-- I don't know how to properly respond, because I work in a law firm, so I'm dealing with attorneys and legal terms, and I need to be professional. And I don't know how to be professional while also being clear and concise and answer their questions in a way that makes me sound intelligent-- or just not even intelligent, just not dumb and answer properly too. So I really struggle. Basically, I just have to rely on templates. So if there's anything that's off the template, I'm kind of screwed, and it also takes me a really long time to go through these-- to go through my template. Basically, I have an Excel document, so I can do a control F to find keywords to see, ""Oh, how did somebody else respond to this exact question,"" because I cannot come up with it on my own. I just don't know how to respond. I get very lost, and it would take me so long to draft something. It still takes me a really long time to draft responses. So a lot of it is my work is, obviously like any job, heavy on communication, writing, and those related skills. I also have to do-- another part of my job is I have to take what a attorney does and translate their work so that another attorney understands their work and is able to say that there's a conflict, if this makes any sense. And the reason there'd be a conflict is because let's say attorney A is representing these clients, and we want to bring them into the firm; I make sure that their clients aren't being sued by us. So in order for them to determine if it's an issue, it depends on the type of the work they did or who did it and things like that, and where they did it and all these things. And I have to translate that and to condense all these weird legal scenarios and situations and rules and blah, blah, blah into a very short, concise, two sentences at max summary. And you need a lot of pertinent detail without being too unnecessary with your detail. And so I really struggle. So there's a lot of ways that I'm struggling. But I struggle with basic stuff, like how to copy-- like when you need to CC somebody on a request, things like that, or time management or just knowing-- I'll get confused as to who to send things to. It takes me so long. I have to follow very specific laid-out instructions, and it's very difficult."
546.0,554.0,Interviewer,That sounds really difficult. You mentioned you got tested. What made you kind of go through that process?
554.0,944.0,Subject,"Oh, and it was a long process too. I had to jump through some hoops to get this testing, because for somebody my age to be having the issues that I have, most people have epilepsy or MS or these other issues when it comes to memory and cognitive stuff. And because I'm 35 and I don't have any of those extenuated circumstances, I really didn't qualify, or people didn't want to see me. But basically what it was is that I thought my whole life that I had ADD. But then one day I realized it's my memory that's really bad. I can't remember books or movies, basically, any type of media, any type of fact. I mean, sometimes things stick, but when I read a book-- almost 90% of the time when I read a book or when I read a movie, I don't understand what I should say afterwards. Like if somebody's like, ""Oh, what was that about?"" It's really difficult for me to recall the facts and express them again, and it's like if somebody jogged my mind, I would be able to remember, and I would see it play out, I guess. But sometimes I don't. If it's long time afterwards, I won't remember anything really. If it's a few months, then I can be jogged or whatever. But I read a few books this year; I can barely remember the characters' names. There's some books, I don't remember their names; I can barely remember the titles. So I have all these issues with memory. I made this whole list of issues. I would leave the keys in the door. I've left the stove on - the stove; not my oven - and all kinds of issues. So I made a list one day thinking like, ""Oh, I just don't pay attention. I have ADD, blah, blah, blah."" And I was like, ""It's a memory issue."" And I do remember that I just said that, now that I said it, but I just want to reinforce that I really struggled with all these things, and when I realized how much it was impacting my life and mostly my job-- I just didn't want to suck at my job, which has progressively gotten worse in the time that I needed the testing to now. So I was like, ""I'm going to get this tested because there's clearly an issue,"" and I was confused a lot. And about a year ago I was hospitalized for psychosis-related stuff and was very confused. And they asked me to do basic tasks, and I was completely taken back by them. I couldn't do them. And so I feel like-- and I could be wrong, but I feel like ever since then my cognitive stuff or memory stuff has gotten worse. So I really wanted to make sure that there isn't something wrong, or if there is something wrong I want to know so I can tell my boss, ""Here's the issue."" But there's nothing that I can do about it, so I haven't decided if I am going to tell him anything, because I finally-- so I had to go to a neurologist. Neurologist said, ""Yeah, your EEG and your MRI from the hospital were fine,"" but I couldn't remember which was the hourly hand or the minute hand, which one was shorter or longer. Now I do, but at the time, I was just like-- on the spot, I was like, ""I don't know."" So there was that, and maybe I got something else wrong on one of those basic intelligence tests, which I'm pretty sure is the same one that Trump took and failed that, or whatever it was. Because I looked, and I think it's the same test. But anyway, I saw the neurologist. He referred me. It took about nine months or so, maybe more, before I could even get an appointment to get this testing done. So I just had this testing done. And I started taking the ADD medicine, but nothing is helping me. But the ADD medicine, it helps with binge-eating, and since I'm a binge-eater, I don't want to switch medicine. I don't want to go to a different ADD medicine, because I like it, and I know there's not sexual side effects or other side effects. So it's like I don't want to have to restart. I already take enough medicines and trial-and-error-type stuff. I don't want to add another one. So I'm just kind of trying to deal with it. But yeah, the main reason is just because it's not even functioning in my adult life. I can forget a book, or we can also look up stuff on what's something about or facts. Although it sucks, because my-- I'm not sure what it's called, but basically, let's say you say something. Other people might be able to associate it with something else and have a quick reaction that's funny or be able to say something off the cuff. I can't do that anymore. I feel like I, at one time, might have been witty or able to jump into something. But now I'm just quiet and reserved because I don't actually have it in me to respond with anything quickly. There's no free association. And it's the same with-- it's kind of how I feel about my memory, is I can look stuff up, but off the cuff, I don't remember facts or anything, pop culture, trivia. So it just sucks in context of having a discussion about something in-depth, and it's like I vaguely remember but I don't totally remember a lot of detail. So it's a lot of my saying, ""Well, I think,"" or, ""I recall, if I remember correctly."" And oftentimes I can only give a vague generalization. And then I do go look it back and there's some truth to it, but not to the extent that I should have or somebody who reads and listens to a lot of podcasts. But yeah, that's the whole reason that I got it done, is just because I didn't really care about my personal life, but at work I was not thriving."
944.0,960.0,Interviewer,"Right. Yeah, I mean, that sounds really difficult to try to navigate. Did you feel like-- you said it might have been different before. Did it feel like it was a sudden change, or was it kind of gradual?"
960.0,1046.0,Subject,"I'm not sure, because my memory is so bad that I don't remember what it was like three years ago. But I know that I didn't feel the same way. I didn't feel like I was inadequate or that my memory was so bad it was causing issues. So I think before in maybe a year and even two months ago-- or two years ago, yeah, I think that I must have had a better memory or better abilities to deal with some of these issues. But I've always had the memory thing, like as long as I can remember. And I will say he thinks a lot of this has to do with emotional or psychological issues, my memory and executive function stuff, which sucks because I think it goes far beyond that. I have memory problems that I don't think are related to just psych issues. But regardless, that was the testing I had done. I know there's more comprehensive testing, but I didn't have that done. I'd like to. But anyway, because of this testing, it showed that and-- what was I talking about? Let me think. So what was your question? I don't even remember."
1046.0,1053.0,Interviewer,"No. I mean, I just was kind of wondering [inaudible] and how, was it sudden?"
1053.0,1166.0,Subject,"Yeah. So where I was going with it is I've always had an issue being-- I think that it's progressed in the past two years. I was certainly not feeling this way a few years ago. But again, it could have been because of the job that I had. But I really think that the struggling is beyond all else. And I try so hard, and I still mess up. And what it was like, quote ""before"" I realized that I had these issues or before it became so detrimental to my work, I think the only thing I can recall is that I was forgetful over media-type stuff, and still facts and things that I've learned, but I wasn't really forgetting stuff in everyday life. I'm not going to say it's a long-term thing, because it's short-term too. I will forget characters or actors. I have no recollection of most actors and actresses, and people are like, ""Oh yeah, they were in this movie."" I don't remember if I saw that movie or not, and I definitely don't remember what it's about. I 100% have always struggled with that area of my life, and it's not normal. And I don't think it's just psych stuff. But it is challenging, and I've had that my whole life. So it's hard, because most people can recall events or things that they said or did or stories. I can't tell a story to save my life, as far as detail goes, or the narrative, because I don't remember all the details that make a good story."
1166.0,1183.0,Interviewer,That's interesting. It sounds like it must be really difficult to work through this at work. You said that New York was kind of the place for you to be. I'm wondering why that is.
1183.0,1450.0,Subject,"I don't even know anymore, because it's not exactly the place to be anymore. But originally, I liked the fact that-- I like that it's-- I don't even use all the 24/7 weird stuff that New York has to offer, but I like the fact that in theory, if I needed to at any time, I could pick up-- I could find a pharmacy to pick up medicines at 12:00 AM or whatever. And I like that you can get delivery anywhere at any time. And again, I don't even use delivery. I just like that I could in theory. I do like to go out to eat late. And that's the thing is I love going to different bars. I love going to different restaurants. I like my job a lot; I just don't do well in it. And my job is based here in New York. The alternative is LA, but that's really far from my family, and I don't think they're looking for somebody in the LA team anyway. But there's other stuff too. I'm very into going to comedy shows. I like a lot of the arts and the culture here, and I like the people. And as a single woman-- I'm 35, and I am single. And dating here is so tricky, because on one hand there's more people, so you're like, ""Oh, the pool is bigger."" But then the other thing is, yeah, there's so much competition. And everyone's beautiful and successful and interesting and cool and whatever. So it's like, ""Would I do someplace better?"" I don't know, because it just takes one person. But it's like, I don't know, maybe I could luck out and be in a city that suddenly there's a few proper candidates that I could date. But right now, I feel like New York has a better pool for the type of people that I'm interested in dating. So I think that all those reasons combined, and I like that you can travel places here. We have an international airport. It's easy to get around without a car. I've sort of forgotten how to drive. I drove when I lived in Atlanta, but I haven't lived in the South in 10 years, because I've lived here, and then before that I did grad school in Philadelphia. So I'm also just rooted here. I have all these friends here. And by all these friends I mean like five, and they're all ex-coworkers and maybe some other people. But yeah, I feel very comfortable. My apartment's nice. I mean, in reality, it's probably not as nice as other apartments that you could get in other cities, but by New York standards I think it's very nice. And I like it, and I'm here, and I've been here a long time, and moving is a pain. So there's all these reasons I don't really want to leave. And to have to go back to my parents' house, I'd kind of feel bad in addition to that. That's the only thing I could think of. I don't want to be-- I don't know what I would do without a job. I have a little bit of savings, but not enough to live off of. So I would need to go somewhere, and I'd have to get rid of all my belongings which I really love, like my furniture that I bought and all these other knick-knacks and things, books, that I've collected over the years, and a lot of vintage stuff. So it would be very challenging. And then on top of that, I would be living in this tiny room at my parents' house, because they have a condo situation. So I really don't want to have to do that. I think it would be devastating, so I'm really hoping that I can work through these issues at work."
1450.0,1457.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Absolutely. And so did you grow up in Atlanta, or--?"
1457.0,1468.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm from Atlanta, yeah. I grew up there, and then I left in my early 20s for grad school, to go to Philly."
1468.0,1470.0,Interviewer,And--
1470.0,1476.0,Subject,"And then from Philly, I moved here. And I've been here about 7-ish years."
1476.0,1498.0,Interviewer,"Gotcha. Sorry, you froze on me for a second, but I think we're caught up. And sorry, I've lost my train of though. Oh, so what was kind of the reason for leaving Atlanta?"
1498.0,1575.0,Subject,"Just grad school and a change. And I just thought there's got to be something better out there, and while I'm young I should move to another place and experience what it's like to live somewhere. I just felt like Atlanta was very stagnant. Everybody kind of stays very complacent. I mean, that's not to say people aren't ambitious, but you just tend to stick to what you know. There's only so many things you can do there, so many people you're going to meet and places you can work and restaurants you can go, whatever else. It just seems very-- it doesn't have a lot of opportunity for growth, it seemed like, and I just wanted to see what it was like out there. I just felt like something could be better, and I was right. So I haven't gone back. Atlanta's gotten a lot cooler in the past 10 years since I've been there, but I don't have a strong desire to go back other than it's affordable and I have some friends there, which is better than going to a town where I don't know anybody. But if I could pick a place to be from, I don't know if I would pick from there. But I'm glad that I grew up there, because it was a nice place to grow up."
1575.0,1578.0,Interviewer,Yeah? What made it a nice place to grow up?
1578.0,1642.0,Subject,"I just grew up in a smaller suburb that was very-- it didn't have a lot of corporations at the time, or just stuff like that or big chains. We didn't have that growing up, even though it was suburban or whatever. And we weren't far from that, but just my town was small and nice, and people were very nice and friendly. And I went to a great school, a great elementary school. I just feel like I had partially a shitty childhood because of the-- I don't know if you read my notes, but I had some issues with my family. And so on one hand, it was very stressful and traumatic, probably since I was like seven up, but there were some aspects of my life that were really nice as far as the community that we lived in and my friends and things like that."
1642.0,1650.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I don't know about anything from your childhood. Do you mind telling me a little bit about that?
1650.0,2563.0,Subject,"Sure. So my brother's 5 years older than me, and he's adopted. And I'm very well-versed in this because I've been in therapy my whole life. So he had a lot of issues growing up, and a lot of mental health issues. He was ADHD, so his issues came out more prominently than mine, because I'm inattentive but don't have the hyperactivity. And per the results that I have, they said I'm dissociated but not like dissociative personality, just dissociated and just have dissociation. I don't know. So anyway, I spent a lot time by myself because my brother was always getting in trouble, and he was a bad kid, and he really put my parents through the wringer. He dropped out of school. He had drug problems. He had alcohol problems. He was abusive to my family and myself, probably since I was like 7. I'm going to guess he was like 12 or 13, so right when he was starting middle school or whatever. He was just always in trouble. I have my journal from then that talks about how-- it's hard to talk about this one. It says, ""I want to kill myself,"" and all this stuff. So yeah. So I'd always struggled with him. And as we got older, he got worse. And shortly after he dropped out, probably when he was about-- maybe it was a little after he dropped out. I guess he was like 19, and he really wasn't doing anything. I dropped out of school too. Don't get me wrong. But I have a master's. And I was against the, I don't know - what's the word? - compulsory aspect of education, and I was very into democratic education and unschooling and stuff like that. And it wasn't because I was just like, ""Fuck this."" Well, it was definitely because of that too. But I at least knew I had other ambitions. And my brother really didn't have any. He was just a drug/alcoholic person. And then he knocked up this girl, and they got married, and he had this kid. And because he really couldn't afford anything, my parents were paying for all this stuff. Meanwhile, at 15, I started working so I could get out of this very toxic environment. And my brother continued to live at home, and so this kid was living with us, because he's 5 years older. So I must have been like 14, so 14/15. So I just started working and had to be around this very hectic, chaotic situation, because my brother's 19 and his girlfriend is 18, and they're trying to control this kid. And they don't know how to do it, and this kid is a lot for them to handle. And then my parents are involved, and my brother doesn't want my parents to be involved. It was really stressful. And then after my brother lost custody because of domestic abuse charges or like domestic abuse/not paying child support. He lost his privileges of seeing this kid. And it's a lot of drama, but I'm just going to stick to the part where-- I'm sticking to my story in life, not his. He was abusive. So even after I moved out, he continued to be-- he was very aggressive. He was really toxic in the house. He would just watch TV 24/7. You couldn't go in the living room because he would just occupy the space. He didn't want you to be around. He just wanted to watch TV. He didn't want you to talk to him. He didn't want you to ask any questions. He didn't want to bond with you. Nothing. He just wanted to be. And so I couldn't really be there, and I didn't really want to watch TV with him anyway, especially not in silence. So I mean, I didn't want to be around him at all. But it was really hard because he was so mean to my parents who had done so much stuff to try to get him help, whether it was rehab or changing schools a bunch, tried private school. They tried all these things that they really didn't even have money to do. They'd borrow money. So he was abusive. He was verbally abusive. He was emotionally abusive. And when I would defend them, he had been physically abusive with me. And one of the more traumatic-- and verbally abusive for sure; he says really fucked-up stuff, the worst things you could say to somebody. But he rear-ended my car. He saw me going into my parents' neighborhood, because he had to leave because we set some boundaries where my brother couldn't be there when I was going to visit my parents, since I already moved out and the whole reason I moved out was to get away from my shitty brother. So he was supposed to leave. Or maybe it was like-- my parents said they set these boundaries, but I have a hard time believing they actually asked him to leave. It was probably convenient, like he was going to work or something. I don't know. But in theory, he was supposed to leave when I came to visit, and that was the case that day except he saw me in the neighborhood, going to their house. And he turned around, and he followed me to their house. He was driving like a maniac behind me. And I didn't really know what to do, so I just-- it wasn't so far from the beginning of the neighborhood where he saw me to the end, or to the street that I needed to turn on, my own street. There's a couple streets in between. And I was just so nervous because I didn't want to go fast because that seemed more dangerous. I didn't want to go slow because I was afraid he would get out. And he had smashed his friend's window before, so I had no doubt that he would try to do something like that with me, and that was in the back of my mind. So what I did was when I got closer to my street I started honking my horn for help. And my parents, they knew, I guess, that he had-- I guess they knew he was having a issue, because they had the garage door open and were somewhat waiting for me, or maybe they heard me coming down the street. But they knew that he was pissed. And so at the light, at the stop sign, I did stop because I didn't know what to do and whatever. And so he rear-ended my car. And then I parked at their house, and I ran in really quickly, and they locked the door. And I guess he had either hit or said something really fucked-up to my mom, because-- oh, and he was saying all this crazy shit when I was there, and then when he left, he skidded through the lawn. So you could see all the tires. But I had a lot of resentment for a long time, because my dad called the police for my mom, but they didn't even mention the issue that I had with him doing all that stuff before it. So I've - what's the word? - harbored a lot of resentment for a long time. And then we're Jewish, so he was like, ""Sieg Heil,"" and all this crazy shit. All this Nazi stuff, because he's adopted, and he wanted to hurt my parents. And so that was my childhood in a nutshell. I left when I was 17 to get away from it. That was when I was visiting them after I left. And I financially support myself. I did all the stuff. It wasn't easy. But I think that there was a lot of trauma. It was very stressful. And it was stressful because a lot of attention went to my brother, which rightfully so; he was nuts. But he was so shitty. It was like he didn't even deserve this extra treatment, but he, I guess, needed it. Doesn't appreciate it still to this day how kind my parents are and how loving they are. He still treats them like shit. So I cut him off. I didn't talk to him for years - I'm talking like 10 years maybe - until I was hospitalized, and he showed some concern. But I cut him off again a few months ago, because I went to visit my family maybe in April after I got the antibody test and I knew that I had been quarantined, like real quarantine. My laundry's in my building. I didn't go anywhere. I only went outside to exercise. I was not around a soul and felt very comfortable going to visit my family. And there's nobody flying at this time in April, and everybody had to wear masks. And I felt fine about it. I was like, ""It's possible that I get this in the airport, but it's pretty unlikely because nobody's flying."" And I approved through my dad's doctor. He said that that was fine. He felt very comfortable with that. So he got somebody to approve it, and so I went. And at first, we wore masks and stuff, but my dad was the one that was not cautious or whatever and trying not to be. And it was fine. It worked out fine. But the harassment that my brother gave my family for letting me visit was insane. And the reason that I wanted to visit while I was quarantined is because I knew that I would never be quarantined to the extent that I was, in my house, alone, because I live by myself, 24/7. 24/7. So I knew that the likeliness of me getting it was very slim, slim to none. And I still felt comfortable. My dad's doctor signed off on it. And I just knew that once the city reopens or once I was not fully quarantined, things are opening up or I want to go see friends, even with masks or whatever, I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't put my dad in that position. So I was like, ""Until there's a vaccine, I'm probably not going to see my dad."" So I wanted to go see them before it was another year, before who knows when, hopefully, before I could see my parents again. So I went and stayed with them for a little bit. But anyway, what I'm trying to say is my brother was so horrific to my parents. And I've been around him and see how he still treats my parents. And it's too much. I could not do it. So I cut him off again. I was like, ""Hey, listen--"" I wrote a small-- or a lengthy, somewhat length, message to him via text and was like, ""Listen, I'm blocking you on every platform. You're still abusive to Mom and Dad. They do not deserve that."" He just says horrible things. He's so mean to them. He makes fun of their age. It's like elder abuse, because they're in their 70s. So he teases them but in a really mean way, and just curses at them. He's just really aggressive and brutal and doesn't stop saying shit he just can't hold back. And he's really condescending. It's awful to be around. And I knew that my parents had it the worst when they told him that I was visiting. And so I was like, ""No. I don't want you in my life, and you need to know that there's consequences for your actions and that these people are humans and that they have feelings and emotions, and you can't just berate them and talk to them and hurt them like that."" And I said, ""Not everyone is as tough as you. People have emotions and feelings."" So then that was it, basically. I stopped. I just cut him out. I deleted any social media we had, which I think I had unfollowed him on a bunch of stuff anyway. But I mean, I feel bad, because it hurt my parents, because they really struggle with the fact that we're not on good terms. But I don't think he should be in their lives either. It's their son, so it's like they just can't kick him out, which is the problem when he was younger too. I felt like they enabled to have all these issues with them too. But I get it, but it's just like he's so toxic. So I don't want to be around it at all, and I have no regrets about kicking him out other than the fact that it makes my parents feel bad that we're at square zero or whatever they're calling it. Square one. Ground zero/square one is where I was going. So yeah, they don't love that, but."

2566.0,2608.0,Subject,"Yeah. And I just feel like he needs to know that he's shitty. So he still doesn't get it. He never apologized to my parents, to me, even though he is sober now. He's like a dry drunk is what they call it when you still pretty much have the same coping strategies or emotional issues that you did when you were-- as you did when you were drinking even though you've stopped drinking. So he's still angry. So yeah, he still has those issues, so I don't want him in my life. And my parents don't deserve that either, but that's on them, so. So yeah, that was my childhood."
