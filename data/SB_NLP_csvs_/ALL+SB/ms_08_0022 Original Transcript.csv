1.0,8.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So the first thing that I am going to ask you is just how have things been going for you, lately?"
8.0,70.0,Subject,"Well, I think I, yeah, I mentioned I was turned, again, into a psychiatric hospital for suicidal ideation at the time. I was there for about three weeks. I recovered, but I still have some dormant pain. And yeah, since then, I've continued my old pursuits, so reading, playing chess, and just walking. Yeah, and I guess, I've been pretty much neutral. I'm just learning. Yeah. My activities, I noticed, are very limited. So four or five things, I think if I have that as a radius, I can motion in life. Yeah."
70.0,78.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what was it like to be in the hospital?
78.0,126.0,Subject,"Well, yeah, quite frankly, yeah, just a bit boring after a while. The strategies to environments like those, they just try to medicate you and simply to rest. And I think the resting helped, but the medication, they mentioned it'll take about two months to kick in. So I'm still waiting for, I guess, the full effects. But yeah, so boredom. And yeah, I just have to be extremely patient because I knew it was for my health. Yeah."
126.0,139.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I'm sure it does take a lot of patience. And so what's it like to have to wait for those effects of the medication? What does that feel like?
139.0,188.0,Subject,"It's mostly disappointing. It's turning into doubt because I don't know if it's myself that's, I guess, healing myself or if it's the medication. So if I reach-- I guess, whenever I reach a higher capacity of myself, I wouldn't know which one to attribute it to, yeah, to be frank. And I think that's actually an impossible question to answer. Yeah. That's just a part of my doubts about the medication. Yeah."
188.0,212.75,Interviewer,So that's really interesting. What do you think the medication would do to make you achieve more? Isn't that still you?
212.75,213.0,Subject,Hello?
213.0,215.0,Interviewer,Hi.
215.0,219.0,Subject,"Yeah, I missed the last part of the question."
219.0,239.0,Interviewer,"Oh, no. I was just asking, that's a really interesting kind of question that you have that it would be interesting to explore. So what do you think the medication would be responsible for?"
239.0,241.0,Subject,What do you mean by responsible?
241.0,256.0,Interviewer,"You said you don't know if the medication would make you kind of be able to do certain things, but wouldn't that still be kind of you and your power to--?"
256.0,282.0,Subject,"Oh, and willpower? Oh, oh, yeah. Perhaps. Yeah. Just it's very ambiguous. Again, I just have to sort of sink into ambiguity, I think, for a while. That's all. Yeah. I have no other thoughts on it, really."
282.0,288.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And how does that ambiguity make you feel?
288.0,340.0,Subject,"Well, yeah, a little restless. Yeah, besides that, it's just a neutral feeling, I suppose. Because it also has to do with it's a possibility of it's still, and it isn't so much in the present. So if I were to, I guess, stop thinking about it, yeah, it probably wouldn't even be an issue if I stopped thinking about it. That's probably a way to put it."
340.0,343.0,Interviewer,"Well, it sounds like you're very thoughtful, so that would be hard. "
343.0,346.0,Subject,Yeah.
346.0,357.0,Interviewer,"So you said you've been out of the hospital for a little while, now, and you've been reading and playing chess. I'm curious how that's going."
357.0,442.0,Subject,"Sure. Yeah, it's just simply, it's a pastime. For instance, yesterday, I went for a 10-mile walk, and I just following my-- it was almost like following myself. I simply just had to play. There's a park, also, maybe two miles within the limitation of 10 miles. And yeah, again, I just followed my footsteps, and then I just followed what I had to do. So the interesting thing is that-- interesting thing is, yeah, it seems to be we have no freewill at all. It's interesting because that you can never [know the why?] to that. We just have to do it as if someone has dictated us. And that's all. I think that's a pretty interesting--"
442.0,451.0,Interviewer,"So you felt like you were just walking, and you weren't necessarily in control of--?"
451.0,466.0,Subject,"Yeah. That seems to be, yeah, the way it is. If [inaudible] just go unconscious without thinking you're fine for some reason [inaudible]."
466.0,468.0,Interviewer,"Without thinking you're fine, you said?"
468.0,470.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah.
470.0,473.0,Interviewer,So what happens when you think?
473.0,558.0,Subject,"Well, it's just going into the many possibilities that can happen or that have knowledge of. So it would be-- thinking has a lot to do, right, with repetition, and fear of repetition, and then realizing repetition is a delusion. So if we follow sensations, we're animals. We have [inaudible]. I'm fine. So for me, now, it's interesting where something in me decides, I stop there, and I play for a while. So if you're simply obedient, you have natural progress. And that seems to be the case for a lot of people, some even though they're not really aware of it. Yeah."
558.0,567.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And when you say you're scared of repetition, what does that mean?"
567.0,600.0,Subject,"It's just when [inaudible] and assuming that it will be, which is just simply a thought. It's residue from time past, not the time that's going. That seems to be the distinction. Yeah."
600.0,607.0,Interviewer,So do you mind telling me a little bit about the past and what it's reminiscent of?
607.0,615.0,Subject,Sure. Could you [limit?] the word past?
615.0,630.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, what you were just describing, you said it was kind of from the past. And so I'm curious how so?"
630.0,646.0,Subject,[inaudible] I'm not sure [inaudible].
646.0,648.0,Interviewer,Whoops. 
648.0,701.0,Subject,"[inaudible] memories. And it doesn't let me sort of move past them. It keeps throwing it in my face. A lot of them have to do with just some embarrassing events in my life, a lot of trauma, pain. And then, some are just mysterious. Yeah. So yeah, I worked on it in my journal. I'm having a hard time reconciling change. That seems to be my issue that's delaying my development. Yeah."
701.0,708.0,Interviewer,And what do you think is kind of uncomfortable about change?
708.0,774.0,Subject,"Nothing, actually. Apparently, it's something we innately do even if we don't realize. Just it's part of evolution. So you embrace it regardless. So, I don't know, [it has?] effect. Yeah, so it just happens with us. It just, for some reason, at the psychiatric hospital, the head doctor I was with, he mentioned this pain could have been developed by most of my childhood trauma and it wasn't innate. So yeah, it isn't simply by nature, it's by development. Yeah."
774.0,785.0,Interviewer,"And do you think that makes you feel differently about it that it's not nature, it's kind of your past?"
785.0,802.0,Subject,"Yeah, I think so. I regard it as just a mental illness and not so much indicative of my character. Yeah. "
802.0,812.0,Interviewer,"And if it were innate, what do you think it would reflect about your character?"
812.0,813.0,Subject,"Oh, I'm sorry. You're cutting out again."
813.0,825.0,Interviewer,"Oh, sorry. I just asked if it were innate rather than kind of given to you--"
825.0,826.0,Subject,You're still cutting out [inaudible].
826.0,829.0,Interviewer,"Oh, gosh."
829.0,830.0,Subject,"Now, it's good. Okay."
830.0,843.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Great. So my question was if it were innate, what do you think that would reflect about someone's character?"
843.0,895.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah, it just has to do with trust and reliability. Yeah, hard to put any trust in people if they're truly just, by nature, I'll use the word, it's evil, or full of malice, or something, or ill will. Yeah, so if it was part of my nature, then I'd try to extremely rehabilitate. I know it's just a mental illness. So that's keeping it at bay. Yeah."
895.0,906.0,Interviewer,And have you felt full of malice or ill will? I'm curious where those words are coming from.
906.0,963.0,Subject,"Sure. There have been times I have, not out of ill will, but I guess, just out of lack of education, I suppose that, yeah, I've been, yeah, just tactless. But I think everyone goes through that. Yeah, and I've been mean. Sometimes I've been arrogant. Nothing like deliberate where I want to cause pain, it's just I've caused pain. I guess, I've caused pain but not intentionally. Yeah."
963.0,965.0,Interviewer,I think we all do that.
965.0,969.0,Subject,Yeah. That's a consoling thought.
969.0,997.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Okay. And so it sounds like you had a lot of kind of discussions about this while you were in the hospital, in addition to the medication. And how are you doing, now? Are you feeling different than you were in the hospital?"
997.0,1035.0,Subject,"Not quite. It's just sort of neutral. I can't really explain it any other way. Yeah, just feeling of neutrality with almost normality. Yeah. Yes. That's how I feel about it. Yeah."
1035.0,1056.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And so what kinds of-- so you're reading, and you're playing chess, what does that kind of bring to your life? Why have you been doing those activities the most?"
1056.0,1105.0,Subject,"Oh, well, yeah, it's just something that interests me, but something, yeah, I think that most of the time it's fun. Yeah, and again, it's like a piano player must be a piano player, an architect has to be an architect, or something. It's similar to just pursing your natural interests. It's truly nothing beyond that, even if pride isn't involved. Yeah."
1105.0,1110.0,Interviewer,And what do you like about chess?
1110.0,1203.0,Subject,"Yeah, one, it's a mysterious game because it isn't like a-- it is like a tested warfare between two people. It's intellectual, and there's a thrill that-- I was watching a video by Bobby Fischer, and he said his greatest pleasure during a match was when he was just crushing a man's ego. And it's strange that it's checkered squares manifests those things in us. So yeah, and then, I think it'll take awhile for every possible move to be completed. I think it's an impossibility, I think. So the fact that it's endless and that it teaches us a lot about us. Yeah, so those two things."
1203.0,1209.0,Interviewer,And what kinds of things has it taught you about yourself?
1209.0,1298.0,Subject,"Yeah, one, that it's a-- yeah, one, that I'm capable of warfare. Yeah, I think that's pretty much it. Nothing, to be honest. And I guess, there could be other reflections made, but I think most of them would be just people can say life is a game of chess, but it just doesn't mean anything. So yeah. So yeah, the fact that I have the ability to be in warfare. And I guess, it is a very aristocratic habit that whoever plays it just enjoys. So that's all, really. Yeah."
1298.0,1325.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And so what do you think when people say-- you don’t' seem very impressed with the phrase, ""Life is like a game of chess."" And I'm curious what is different about life and chess?"
1325.0,1364.0,Subject,"No, it's as simple as just it being very vague, and it doesn't really teach you anything. It's un-insightful. Nothing beyond that. But my personal hunch is just that they are factually incomparable. That's just a hunch. So I don't know. Yeah."
1364.0,1377.0,Interviewer,Fair enough. And so what have you been reading?
1377.0,1540.0,Subject,"Right now, I'm reading a novel by Marcel Proust, a French philosopher. I'm reading, I think, yeah, just that. And then, I finished a book of reflections by Mr. Einstein. Then, another for French philosopher who I'm learning from. I've read Time and Freewill. And I'm hoping to get a book printed out soon about duration and simultaneity. What's interesting about, just so I can clarify that they are actual things, interesting is just that duration and simultaneity, he's going with the intent of discovering lost element of time. His experiment's going to that and what he's learned. So it's very much in the same thread of Marcel Proust. It's [actually?] trying to-- what they're trying to do is trying to, if I'll use a crude image, like trying to, with the [inaudible], trying to drink every single atom or drop of water [inaudible] to life, they're trying to swallow it as much as possible. It's a very curious because it's a desire, as well. So it's not free from anything personal. So it's not disinterested. So it's curious why these men had the sense of doing just out of instinct they do it for some reason because they must or something. Yeah, so just those two books at the moment."
1540.0,1544.0,Interviewer,So it sounds like you really like philosophy. 
1544.0,1553.0,Subject,Yeah. I think that's probably what I'm naturally inclined to. Yeah. 
1553.0,1560.0,Interviewer,What about philosophy do you think that you're the most drawn to?
1560.0,1628.0,Subject,"At the moment, it's allowing me aspects of happiness, just purely personal enjoyment. Yeah, and out of life-- before out of pleasure of a [inaudible] or something, so life is the direct source. And with this, it's just, yeah, it just allows you really to be happy, or, I guess, just to strive for happiness. So I think that's pretty in the summation. Yeah, that's what I like about it."
1628.0,1636.0,Interviewer,Do you remember the first time you kind of discovered philosophy or discovered that you liked it?
1636.0,1698.0,Subject,"Yeah. I picked up a book by Soren Kierkegaard, a Danish philosopher, and yeah, it simply just this, it has to do with sensing there's a thread or this feeling of universality between you and other men. So I think that's what that book introduced to me. And this was only about two years ago. So pretty late if I consider myself 124. So at least I reached it early enough that I'm not so late. Yeah."
1698.0,1714.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's great. And do you think that philosophy is something that you will pursue for a long time?
1714.0,1756.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think so. And for practical work, I might just try to make films or try to adapt, yeah, to make films, adapt a [novel?] or something or pursue photography. But I want philosophy, I put that naturally just first before many forms. Like art could be a form. Yeah. "
1756.0,1768.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Definitely. And so film making and photography, what do you think makes you want to do those things?"
1768.0,1838.0,Subject,"I've discovered that, yeah, with the film and camera, since it's necessarily in motion, it gets closer to natural sense of life's, they call it, duration or they call it the continuum. And film, since it's a place for mimicry, it could at least get a moving surface, at the very least. So I think that aspect is pretty cool where you could use a device where you get somewhat close to the hard whatever it is. Yeah, but besides that, yeah, I don't know. But I guess, it would be cool to experiment what [fun?] to do with a friend or something. Yeah."
1838.0,1846.0,Interviewer,And is film and or photography something that you've done a lot of to date?
1846.0,1878.0,Subject,"Just photography. I do have maybe once a month or so I take photos, and I have an Instagram page where I post them. But nothing besides that. I value just reading and trying to discover [atoms?] more so than film and photography. Yeah."
1878.0,1880.0,Interviewer,Trying to discover what? Sorry.
1880.0,1891.0,Subject,"Just trying to discover insights or-- yeah, just insights, truths, or other senses."
1891.0,1903.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what kinds of things do you photograph that you think serve that purpose?
1903.0,1905.0,Subject,Serve the purpose of--?
1905.0,1910.0,Interviewer,Of gaining those insights or showing those insights.
1910.0,1962.0,Subject,"Oh, I guess, in a more competitive sense, it validifies that I am actually interested in these things. I think it's partially like self-validation, in a sense. I'm curious who would admit it, though. I do. Yeah, but I guess, that has to do with a lack of confidence, but it's more like just to say that, yeah, I'm not insane. There's proof. Yeah, just in that sense, nothing else, really."
1962.0,1970.0,Interviewer,So what is the proof that you just mentioned?
