2.0,6.0,Interviewer,So how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,13.0,Subject,Things are actually going pretty well. I'm moving out of my parents' house tomorrow.
13.0,15.0,Interviewer,"Well, that's exciting."
15.0,23.0,Subject,Yeah. So things have been going pretty good. I'm looking for a new job. Yeah.
23.0,29.0,Interviewer,Nice. And what types of jobs are you looking for or thinking about?
29.0,47.0,Subject,"I wanted to do something along the lines of case managing, but I kind of am just finding stuff in the field instead of that kind of exact position. Yeah."
47.0,50.0,Interviewer,So case managing in social work?
50.0,51.0,Subject,"Yeah, kind of. Yeah."
51.0,62.0,Interviewer,"Oh, cool. Wow. Is that something that you have known that you were interested in for a while, or is this a recent development?"
62.0,71.0,Subject,"No. So I graduated with a psychology degree. That's another thing that's going pretty well, actually. I just got my [inaudible] thing--"
71.0,77.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Oh, my gosh, that's huge. Congrats."
77.0,123.0,Subject,"--in December. So yeah, I was kind of just looking for jobs in the psychology field. And I started off doing ABA therapy for kids with autism. I really, really enjoyed the work, but it's just really inconsistent. So I kind of need something that's a regular 9:00 to 5:00. Yeah, so I was kind of told about case managing through internships that I had. And yeah, I just kind of did a big job search and found a bunch of stuff that's similar and related."
123.0,140.0,Interviewer,"That's awesome. Wow. Oh, therapy sounds so cool. I feel like I've been doing this job now for a while, and we don't have any therapy opportunity or anything like that. That's so awesome. Was that through a lab, or was that through a university? Or how did that work?"
140.0,143.0,Subject,"No, I found it on Indeed. [laughter] "
143.0,147.0,Interviewer,I didn't check out Indeed. [laughter]
147.0,197.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean it's an entry-level position. You just do a 40-hour training, and then you basically start. I didn't get my certificate, but you could and you'd get paid more. Yeah. So I mean I think pretty obviously, working with children with autism has its upsides and downsides. But the case that I was on right now, the kids are going on vacation. But the case I'm on, they're very high functioning, so it's not that bad. But the first case I was ever on was a lot more difficult. But, yeah."
197.0,203.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What were some of the challenges that you experienced with working with these autism children?
203.0,316.0,Subject,"Well, especially in the first case just interacting with the child just in general was really difficult. So he had echolalia, and it was pretty severe. So almost anything you would say to him, he would just repeat it back to you, and that was his way of processing what you were saying. But he wasnâ€™t answering the questions or having a conversation with you. And it doesn't sound as bad because it's like, okay, maybe just don't have those deeper conversations that some kids want to have about like, ""What is this?"" or, ""What is that?"" But to the point where it's like, ""Do you have to use the bathroom?"" and his response was, ""Do you have to use the bathroom?"" So you'd kind of just have to do a bunch of things for him. And yeah, there were scripted conversations that we would have, but even that-- because I like to kind of overachieve and go above and beyond, so I'd want him to kind of have more responses even to conversations that were scripted, so [inaudible] to. But the case that I'm on right now the kids are going on vacation. That's why I'm not working this week. Yeah, they're good. It's just kind of behavior and emotional development that's the issue and to manage their emotions in an appropriate way. But other than that, they're really good kids."
316.0,337.0,Interviewer,"That's awesome. So you go in-- sorry, I just don't have a good sense of what this would look like. So you go in and they just say, ""Okay, this is your new case. These are their troubles. This is what they need help with,"" and you just work directly with them? Or what happens?"
337.0,414.0,Subject,"So they kind of will send out emails every now and then, maybe every few months, and just with announcements of available cases. Or if you want to pick up a case then you reach out to the director and you tell her you want to pick up a new case. And then they would just tell you a little bit about the case and where it's located in the city. And then you can choose to-- yeah, you basically just choose whatever case you want to work on. And what was I going to say? Yeah, you just go in based on what the schedule-- the schedule is preset for the case, depending on what the insurance company approves for the child and what the child's school schedule is like. Some kids will have services that they need in the middle of the school day, I guess, in between classes or something. But most kids are usually daily from 3:00 to 7:00 or something like that. So yeah, you just go based on when the kids are available. Yeah."
414.0,420.0,Interviewer,And then you would actually go to their house or to their school or--?
420.0,426.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, with those two cases I've been in the home. Yeah."
426.0,450.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. That's so cool. I mean I just feel like it would be-- I guess I'm a little surprised that they have all these people coming in the home. Obviously they need the support and that's huge. I just feel like it's so interesting that they let people just kind of come in and help out that way. It just feels so personal, in a good way though."
450.0,534.0,Subject,"It is personal. I mean there are things that you have to do-- like some kids need help with steps to use the bathroom and then to get dressed and to eat dinner. I'm sorry. That was a big challenge that I forgot with the case that I'm on now, with feeding. He has-- I wouldn't call it a food aversion. That's not really what it is. I forgot what the diagnosis is, but he doesn't really eat a lot of foods and he throws up, depending on the temperature and the texture. So we would spend a lot of time at the dinner table, just basically doing what they do on a daily basis, but doing with the family. So yeah, we would be the dinner table with them and just do what the kids have to do, like doing their homework, because that was also a skill, like sustained attention. Yeah. So I think it can be kind of challenging for the parents, in a way, to have people in the home a lot. And that's a part of why this case was really inconsistent, because I think the mom was cancelling a lot of the sessions because of that. "
534.0,538.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]. Yeah.
538.0,573.0,Subject,"So the job, in general, has its pros and cons. Most of the time it's a pretty fun job, but it's per diem, so it's not really-- I think a lot of people don't really understand that you go when you're asked to and when you need to come in. Granted, the mother should not have been cancelling that much. So that shouldn't have happened either, but yeah, it's just kind of an interesting position."
573.0,578.0,Interviewer,Also it's kind of like a tutor but for life almost. Right?
578.0,580.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah. [laughter] 
580.0,616.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Because people can cancel a tutoring session and have that-- that's fine. For example, I sometimes have tutored in the past and people can just cancel up to one day before. But you still have to-- I don't know. It's just so interesting that you do that in the home with all these daily activities. I think that's so cool. I think everyone could benefit from that a little bit. I mean someone sitting down with you and helping you just do your homework and-- I love that insurance pays for that. I always feel like insurance is so not good at paying for things."
616.0,637.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's not. [laughter] I can see the changes in how the services go when a family changes their insurance or something, because all of a sudden it'll be like, ""Oh, they're approved for one more hour on Fridays if we worked an hour less on Fridays."" So, yeah."
637.0,641.0,Interviewer,"Oh, so it's very small what they cover."
641.0,643.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. "
643.0,647.0,Interviewer,I thought it's all covered.
647.0,650.0,Subject,"Oh, well, my sessions, insurance pays for it. Yeah."
650.0,658.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. All of them? So if you go-- how many times would one actually go? I don't know."
658.0,659.75,Subject,"Oh, how many times do I go to work?"
659.75,660.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
660.0,673.0,Subject,"So well, it depends on the case and what the child needs, but the two cases I've been on have been 19 hours and 20 hours. So we go every day for four hours a day. Excuse me."
673.0,681.0,Interviewer,"Oh, gosh. So 20 hours of support per week is paid for from insurance. That's pretty good. Bless you."
681.0,684.0,Subject,Thank you. Yeah.
684.0,703.0,Interviewer,"Wow. That's very good. That's cool. And I mean it-- sorry. I'm just learning so much. I don't even know if you want to talk about this. [laughter] Okay. Well, that's awesome. So do you think that it's something, since it's kind of in after-school hours, you might be able to continue doing a little bit even if you do have another job?"
703.0,731.0,Subject,"I did put in a letter of resignation since I'm looking for something else. But I think you can definitely do it with a fulltime job, but you would have to take on a-- at least for me, take on a lot less hours, and it depends on the hours of your job, because you need to be able to reach the children when they're available and not [inaudible] PM to midnight. "
731.0,732.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That makes sense.
732.0,764.0,Subject,"There are cases where you can take on the case on Saturday and Sunday and just be there for five hours or four hours a day. Yeah, but it just brings me back to what you were saying, about the parents having someone in the home a lot. I think a lot of parents do appreciate the support and they see the progress that the child makes, but at the same time it's kind of a lot to have people in and out so much. "
764.0,773.0,Interviewer,I can see at least parents feeling observed or-- 
773.0,813.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think in both of my cases the parents came from outside of this country, and you can just see how the way they talk about their migration from there to here, they kind of tend to feel like-- well, I don't want to generalize too much, but just especially in my cases it's really clear that they kind of feel a little bit of shame for the way the kids are."
813.0,821.0,Interviewer,"In the sense of their living situation or in the sense of linguistic, culture? Or in what way?"
821.0,892.0,Subject,"I think that just a lot of people that are foreigners and they come to live in the States, they kind of tend to kind of have a lot of pressure to excel academically, because they expect the best possible life, living in the United States. So when the child is not retaining information or is not having intellectual conversations-- and this is not the case for both of the kids. It's in a slightly different way. Because in my case they were very academic, but just socially in school they weren't performing. No matter what it is, that area of challenge, the parent can start to be really frustrated over it. So yeah, that's something that I notice is kind of hard. And I'm sure it would be hard for any parent to know that their child is kind of facing this challenge that it seems to come really naturally for other children."
892.0,968.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I also feel like the whole caregiver role is a very under-supported role. I don't know if you feel this way, but when anyone has a chronic illness or a mental health issue or something that has a long processing life challenge, there is usually, in a supportive family or just a supportive, I don't know, relationship of any sort, there is somebody who is kind of there supporting that person through all the daily struggles. And I feel like that person, especially in the supporting role, doesn't get that much support. There is no support for the support. And I think that's also really hard. I don't know if insurance would cover necessarily therapy for this mom who is-- or if that mom would even have time to take care of therapy for herself when she is worrying about all this stuff that her child might need. So I don't know; do you think-- I don't know. How do you feel about kind of what the role is of a supporter or caregiver in that way?"
968.0,1003.0,Subject,"I agree that I think that insurance should take into account that not everything needs to be a serious mental health diagnosis in order to be acknowledged. I know of this place called NAMI-NYC, and I was looking on their calendar at one point, and I noticed that they have a lot of groups for families and friends of people that have mental health diagnosis."
1003.0,1005.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow."
1005.0,1095.0,Subject,"So, yeah. It never really dawned on me how much people need support with their supporting until I kind of saw-- because you don't really think about it in that way kind of just about only the person. Because in the case that I work on now, they're Bengali, and they actually don't believe in therapy. So my job title is behavior technician or therapist, and they don't call us the therapist. They'll call us the teacher, and the kids will kind of be like, ""Oh, my home teacher, my home teacher."" So I can see that they don't-- even in the first case that I was on that was much more challenging, the mother would just admit that she doesn't accept the autism diagnosis. She only accepted it because she found out that we can work on academics. And I think that that's kind of upsetting, but I could just see the ways that it was kind of hard for her to navigate the fact that somebody was coming into their home, working with her kid on this stuff that should be kind of simple to him."
1095.0,1141.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's so interesting. Wow. Actually, one my closest friends is Bengali and comes from a Bengali family, and we've talked at length about kind of cultural differences that exist and just different perspectives they have and especially the older generation, that they have regarding a lot of different topics, even just parties or just anything like that. And it's interesting to hear that that sometimes in certain families can extend to therapy. And yeah, I just think there is so much stigma still, especially in immigrant communities around therapy and support."
1141.0,1184.0,Subject,"Yeah. Speaking of that area, that country, I think that they don't have a word, now that I think of it, for therapist. So yeah, so I think that's a part of the reason. I mean it doesn't make it any better that the mental health is still stigmatized. But I think that that's a big-- I'm sorry. I thought I closed the meeting. I think that's a part of the reason why they don't call us the therapist, because it's not really a thing. Yeah."
1184.0,1251.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It's just interesting because there are some-- I guess you could think, ""Oh, well, if the culture didn't see a need for this position, then the language didn't see a need to accommodate that word."" So you can think about it that way. Or you could just think of it as this position couldn't exist maybe because everyone was kind of too busy with just getting through the day-to-day necessities of life to even have somebody to support them through that. That's kind of more of a privileged situation to just be able to go somewhere just to talk about difficult things that are going on when people sometimes just have to get through them and go to the next difficult day. But yeah, it's just so-- I think New York City is such an interesting place to be doing this work, because I feel like you already did this work, but you have experienced kind of a window into so many different families and cultures. [inaudible]."
1251.0,1279.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't really take for granted the relationship building that you get out of it, with the children but also with the family. I mean I know it sounds a little silly, but I've tried these different foods being with the family and just you see the different ways that different people do things. So kind I'll still kind of text her a picture if I make something that she made for the kids."
1279.0,1307.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, absolutely. Oh, my gosh. Food is such a uniting force too. I love food [laughter] for so many reasons. I just think it's such a communal, social, sharing, caring activity to make someone food or to eat food or to share food with someone. Are you big into cooking? Is that something you enjoy?"
1307.0,1325.0,Subject,I like food. I like cooking. I'm going to start cooking more because I'm moving out and I just want to save money. I like cooking easy things. Yeah. [laughter] I don't really make the really big difficult meals.
1325.0,1329.0,Interviewer,What's an easy thing for you that you like to make?
1329.0,1334.0,Subject,Just burgers or--
1334.0,1338.0,Interviewer,Whoo. That's not too easy. [laughter] 
1338.0,1346.0,Subject,--pasta dishes. Just something that goes in the oven and bakes is pretty easy.
1346.0,1352.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yum. When's lunchtime? Oh, it's only 12:30. [laughter] "
1352.0,1355.0,Subject,Do you cook?
1355.0,1362.0,Interviewer,So what are you excited about this move and the potential for some burgers and pasta bakes?
1362.0,1374.0,Subject,"Oh, well, I'm moving in with my boyfriend, so I'm going to see what it's like living on my own. Yeah. It's, I guess, a new chapter for us."
1374.0,1376.0,Interviewer,Yay.
1376.0,1425.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean yesterday was Valentine's Day, and I think we never really had to discuss it formally, but we both know everything is going on right now, so we kind of didn't do anything special for Valentine's Day. And I think it was just kind of cool that it was like-- I mean it doesn't sound nice to be like, ""Yeah, we didn't do anything on Valentine's Day,"" but I think it was kind of cool because it was a mutual unspoken thing that we both understand a lot is changing. So the money being spent on furniture and stuff, it can't really go toward a fancy dinner this year."
1425.0,1446.75,Interviewer,"No, yeah. I know what you mean though. It's not about celebrating the fact that you didn't go out for dinner. It's more like that you're both on the same page and you kind of both are planning in that way for maybe the next step or whatever. I think that is nice to always just feel like, ""Oh, we're in this together. We're coming from the same place."" "
1446.75,1447.0,Subject,Yeah.
1447.0,1450.0,Interviewer,How long have you guys been together?
1450.0,1455.0,Subject,It's about to be four years in a month or two.
1455.0,1460.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. That's huge. This is so exciting. [laughter] "
1460.0,1462.0,Subject,Thank you.
1462.0,1469.0,Interviewer,So you said you hadnâ€™t lived with him before. And what do you think? I'm sorry. Go ahead.
1469.0,1502.0,Subject,"I mean not seriously, kind of paying bills and stuff, but technically I stay with him for months at a time ever since COVID. It's kind of a long story, but he got COVID and I didn't want to bring it back home, so I stayed there for much longer than two weeks. And yeah, the rest is kind of history. I've just been with him for a while at his parents' place. "
1502.0,1507.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Got it. Oh, what are his parents like? Do you like them? Do you guys--?"
1507.0,1527.0,Subject,"Well, he lives with his mom and the rest of his family. They're a very unconventional family, [laughter] I can say at least. He puts it like they're the opposite of my family. "
1527.0,1529.0,Interviewer,In what way?
1529.0,1564.0,Subject,"My family is very quiet, and his family is very loud. And mine is, I guess, obviously I said quiet. They're a little bit more soft spoken, and his is like-- they'll say anything to you. But yeah, I mean it's not something that made me not want to be around them, because I know my family is a little bit more quiet and soft spoken than most people are, but yeah."
1564.0,1569.0,Interviewer,That's so funny. I love when that happens. I just think it's a movie.
1569.0,1571.0,Subject,"Yeah, like being around the opposite or so?"
1571.0,1591.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Especially when you're so different, and then you get thrown into that and it's just funny. I don't know. Do you feel like-- so what has your experience been like in the more loud, say-anything type of environment? Have you grown to like it? Does it still feel like, ""I need my space""? What's the vibe there?"
1591.0,1615.0,Subject,"I kind of had an I-need-my-space moment this past weekend because I was doing workouts in their living room, and they just kind of took it upon themselves to make fun of me. It's all love at the end of the day but I was just kind of like, ""Okay. Time to go in his room, in private."""
1615.0,1635.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yes. No, I definitely understand that.  But yeah, that's just good. I think the fact that you have the underlying understanding that it's coming from a good place or at least underlying feeling that it's coming from a good place makes it maybe more acceptable."
1635.0,1640.0,Subject,Yeah. That's a good word. [laughter] 
1640.0,1649.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my gosh. I just can't believe that-- I just think that's going to be so fun. I'm just so excited. I don't know anything about him or you, really, in terms of you--"
1649.0,1650.0,Subject,"Oh, thank you. [laughter] "
1650.0,1659.0,Interviewer,I'm just looking forward to that for you and that [inaudible]. And does he have a job as well? Or is he looking for one or--?
1659.0,1662.0,Subject,"Yeah, he works in Harlem."
1662.0,1664.0,Interviewer,"Oh, nice. Doing what?"
1664.0,1668.0,Subject,He works in HR for recruiting.
1668.0,1673.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that is getting bigger and bigger these days."
1673.0,1687.0,Subject,"Really? Oh, wow. I didn't know that. Well, I guess so, because his whole college degree is in human resources. So I guess that kind of speaks volumes for the fact that that's a big thing right now."
1687.0,1719.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I think it's definitely getting-- because a lot of these companies are just outsourcing their whole recruitment effort to new companies that are developing just for the purpose of recruiting. You can imagine that it takes a lot of effort and resources on the part of a company to put out the ads, find the people, vet them. Imagine how many applications all the [inaudible] people get. I'm sure there are people who just spend--"
1719.0,1720.0,Subject,It's like 600.
1720.0,1754.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And so they require, whatever, resumes and cover letters. And then you have to choose who you're going to interview. And then you're going to interview. So there's a lot that goes into it, and I think more and more people are trying to have these outside companies basically do it for you. So I could see that recruiting-- and then that extends to HR, keeping them happy within the company and making sure that they're defended, I guess, or that they have a place to go and they have that [inaudible]."
1754.0,1809.0,Subject,"Yeah. He has to know a lot of legal and benefit stuff. I feel like he kind of has a privileged position because he's-- I don't know how to describe it. I feel like he's kind of protected in a way from things, because he knows all the rules and he kind of has to deal-- sometimes I call his job the fun job, because it's not fun for the people involved, but when he has to settle some sort of, not mishap, but even just drama that goes on in the office, sometimes he'll tell me about what happened. And I just feel like he's kind of in a sort of privileged position in his job to just kind of know the ins and outs of how everything is working. And then I get to hear some of the stories about what's going on and so. Yeah."
1809.0,1865.0,Interviewer,"That's very fun. [laughter] Yeah, that's so true. I think each job probably has this to a different degree, and maybe some are more apparent than others. But I always feel lawyers and anybody who works in these kind of HR, legal, any of these situations has such a detailed knowledge about something that's usually such a black box for the main population. But they're at such a huge advantage. I'm sure that if he ever went to work in another firm he would know all his rights. He would know what benefits he should be getting, what they should write in the contracts. I know so many people who just get taken advantage of, for example, because their contracts are really vague and they don't know. They overpromise verbally, but then I the contract they don't write everything that they say you're going to have as part of your employment or whatever."
1865.0,1868.0,Subject,Yeah. That sucks. 
1868.0,1900.0,Interviewer,"But I feel like from your job you're also kind of getting that type of experience, just in a different domain; how to deal with all these types of people; what it's like to live in a family with these different challenges or these different cultures. I feel like all that is also kind of niche information that the general public is not privy to either. Maybe it doesnâ€™t seem like immediately as relevant, but I don't know. What do you think?"
