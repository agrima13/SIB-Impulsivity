1.0,21.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So we are recording. I guess maybe you could start about saying a little bit about what you're like and how things are going for you these days. I mean, it's a conversation between us so you don't have to feel like you have to talk right to it or anything."
21.0,32.0,Subject,"So I invest my time mostly in songwriting, and screenplays, dance."
32.0,36.75,Interviewer,"So you spend a lot of time doing songwriting, screenplays--"
36.75,37.0,Subject,Dance.
37.0,41.0,Interviewer,--and dance. Cool. Have you been doing those things for a while?
41.0,43.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah.
43.0,47.0,Interviewer,So are they like hobbies or do you--
47.0,58.0,Subject,"Well, I want to make them a career. So for now, they're like investments and I'm putting a lot of hours into it. Yeah."
58.0,64.0,Interviewer,Okay. Have you been-- so when did you start doing some of these things?
64.0,80.0,Subject,"I went to school for dance. So for a while, dance-- screenwriting, I also took a couple classes, but it's been more something, over the past year. And songwriting, I always dabbled in songwriting. So-- yeah."
80.0,85.0,Interviewer,Okay. So do you make money from these things or--?
85.0,101.0,Subject,"So there are gigs sometimes. I guess [inaudible] before on [inaudible]. It's up and down. Obviously, it's not stable right now but I know that it's getting there. So that's always--"
101.0,120.0,Interviewer,I'm sorry. I just realized I forgot to [inaudible] rolling again. So if you could just back up thirty seconds for me. You were saying that these are some of the things that you've been occupying most of your time with and-- so tell me a little bit more about these things. What have they been like?
120.0,151.0,Subject,"Sure. So I as a writer, you have to write constantly, and sometimes it's very challenging because you don't have a nine-to-five set job, and you have to sort of look for gigs, and it can be very challenging. My father is a published author and he himself, after 60 years of writing, sometimes he can't get a book published. So it's a bit disheartening but-- so I get gigs here and there and--"
151.0,153.0,Interviewer,Writing gig?
153.0,166.0,Subject,"Yeah. Writing gigs, acting gigs, film, dance sometimes. They're far and few, but I'm trying to focus on my own stuff so that I can self-produce and bring out-- yeah."
166.0,167.0,Interviewer,Your own stuff being producing?
167.0,168.0,Subject,Own film.
168.0,169.0,Interviewer,"Oh, your own film?"
169.0,171.0,Subject,"Yeah. I just wrote a screenplay, so I'm trying to get it out."
171.0,174.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's incredible. Wow."
174.0,187.0,Subject,"Yeah. The hardest part is getting it out, though. It's writing, and then having an audience, and having people wanting-- getting funding. Because to make a movie costs a lot."
187.0,192.75,Interviewer,So writing it is one thing. But getting the money to make it into a film is another thing?
192.75,193.0,Subject,Yes. Yeah.
193.0,196.0,Interviewer,Okay. So has that been occupying a lot of your time lately?
196.0,204.0,Subject,Not so much. No. I'm relaxed at this state. I'm just letting it flow. Yeah.
204.0,208.0,Interviewer,"What was it like writing a screenplay for a movie? A film, right? How did you--"
208.0,247.0,Subject,"Yeah. It was very ecstatic because of the way I write. I sort of just get ideas of different days and it's all-- it's actually, it's funny. I have a notebook. It's a little red notebook. I got inspired. I said to myself, I'm just going to write in my journal. And then I started journaling, and it sounded like a book. So I changed the character to be someone else, and I wasn't journaling anymore. In the beginning, I was journaling about myself and then after a couple pages, I just started writing about this young girl. And then I'm like, oh my god, this sounds like it could be a movie. So I sort of-- I'm adapting to film. Yeah."
247.0,263.0,Interviewer,"Wow. So once you started, you intended it to be a journal. But then after you got a little ways in, you realized that it would be a cool, and sort of, creative piece of story, of fiction?"
263.0,265.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
265.0,267.0,Interviewer,Cool. So when did you do that?
267.0,277.0,Subject,"I started journaling and then transitioned to writing it, I think, back in February."
277.0,279.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So that's pretty quick, right?"
279.0,283.0,Subject,"Yeah. Or it might have been maybe before, December, [inaudible]. Yeah."
283.0,293.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And it's been an arduous process since then to try to get it to the next step, or has it not been too frustrating?"
293.0,314.0,Subject,"It's been pretty arduous in the beginning because I kept-- just couldn't write it down. I kept thinking I got this, as they say, artist block, and then he finally explained to me how some things you just got to let go and at the right time, you'll just want to write it down. And it did happen that way. It just started flowing better. Yeah."
314.0,324.0,Interviewer,"And since then, since you wrote it down, it's been a little frustrating to not be able to get it to the next stage or--?"
324.0,346.0,Subject,"I've sort of been going with sort of my gut instinct is that it's not going to get out there until next year. I just have this instinct, and it does take a while to get things promoted and produced. So I'm sort of just hanging in there. I'd rather it be produced well than just out. Yeah."
346.0,351.0,Interviewer,"Gotcha. And so you studied dance, you said?"
351.0,352.0,Subject,Yeah.
352.0,357.0,Interviewer,Cool. So anything particular with dance that you-- what have you been doing lately with it?
357.0,385.0,Subject,"With dance? Not much. I've been taking classes. I always wanted to start a dance movement because I like dance being very free-flowing and sometimes classes aren't as free-flowing, especially in ballet. I like to take a lot of ballet so maybe one day I'd like to create kind of like great combination of ballet and free-falling ballet."
385.0,386.0,Interviewer,Free-falling ballet?
386.0,393.0,Subject,Yeah. Sort of like plié but like gentler and just-- all the movements just gentler.
393.0,400.75,Interviewer,Okay. And you'd like to create something that's a combination of free-falling ballet and--?
400.75,401.0,Subject,And regular--
401.0,402.0,Interviewer,And regular--
402.0,404.0,Subject,--traditional ballet.
404.0,412.0,Interviewer,Cool. What do you think that would-- what do you think it would be like to create a movement? What would that mean?
412.0,450.0,Subject,"I guess it would be just like a spark of something different. Back in the day there was, basically, only ballet. And then Isadora Duncan, sort of, tore that apart, and she was sort of the mother of modern dance. She totally reinvented it. And then people followed in her way. And then there was post-modernism, and now there's so many different types of modern dance. So I feel like maybe it's time for something completely new."
450.0,453.0,Interviewer,So maybe your movement would be something completely new so--
453.0,455.0,Subject,Yeah. Maybe. Yeah.
455.0,469.0,Interviewer,"Cool. So the third thing you said, you've been doing the writing, you've been doing dance and what was the third thing? I thought there was one more thing you said."
469.0,477.0,Subject,"Yeah. Writing, dance, and singing. Yeah."
477.0,482.0,Interviewer,"And singing. You've been doing auditions. Are you-- you've done some acting, singing and acting? Is that right?"
482.0,484.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
484.0,487.0,Interviewer,What has that been like? What do you like about that?
487.0,488.0,Subject,I don't like much about it.
488.0,491.0,Interviewer,You don't like much about it. Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough.
491.0,492.0,Subject,Yeah.
492.0,495.0,Interviewer,Have you been doing it a long time?
495.0,504.0,Subject,Auditioning? I'd say about two years. Yeah. It's not a long time in the broad spectrum of auditioning.
504.0,506.0,Interviewer,What do you audition for?
506.0,511.0,Subject,"Various roles, sometimes off-Broadway, sometimes Broadway, sometimes just film."
511.0,514.0,Interviewer,Okay. So mostly musicals but then some--
514.0,524.0,Subject,"Yeah. I've realized that I actually don't even like musicals, so I'm going away from that."
524.0,528.0,Interviewer,"What don't you like about them, do you think? Or what is it that's making this change?"
528.0,577.0,Subject,"Right. I think there's just sort of-- I project a lot, and sometimes you have to be extra. You have to have extra character almost. You got to almost just jazz it up a bit. And I mean, I love jazz, but in a sense, I don't know-- I almost find them sometimes quite fake because there's just-- you're singing but it's not like almost olden-times singing where it was just singing, like Singing in the Rain. It's almost like every scene you got to sing a song. And there's not much acting. I mean, of course, in musicals they're acting, but I just prefer solid acting on screen. And if there's a singing part, okay."
577.0,591.0,Interviewer,"Interesting. So you prefer the acting without the singing, you think, and without the overwrought fake acting or something like that?"
591.0,616.0,Subject,"Something like that. I feel like maybe if it would change up a bit. Just singing, I love singing and acting, too, but there's something unnatural about having a scene where there's two people interacting and all of a sudden, breaking into song. That doesn't happen in real life. I guess I'd say I like the realness of just being real on stage and not-- yeah."
616.0,623.0,Interviewer,Absolutely. So what is it like going to an audition?
623.0,673.0,Subject,"Audition. So because I'm not union, so there's something called the union, actor's union. And even to get into the union, to have to sort of be an extra for a couple of roles, and then they give you a card, and then you have to pay a certain amount every year, and then you're in the union. Once you're in the union, then you have rights to be in certain films and you get paid more. And you have time slots for, say they're auditioning for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, if you're in the union, you have, let's say, your time slot at 10:00 AM. You go in, you sing a 16-bar song, you perform, and they give you three minutes and that's your time. And you practice this, maybe, for a week. So it's rough."
673.0,676.75,Interviewer,So 16 bars as in like--
676.75,677.0,Subject,Sheet music.
677.0,679.0,Interviewer,"Three minutes or something, two minutes, or--"
679.0,683.0,Subject,"It's even worse, probably. Yeah. Probably worse than that. Yeah."
683.0,685.0,Interviewer,"And that's the audition, for the most part?"
685.0,698.0,Subject,"For the most part, then I think sometimes there's dance first. So for Broadway, you have to know how to dance and sing. So sometimes there's first, the dance audition and then, if you get called back, then and only then, do you sing. Sometimes it's the opposite."
698.0,702.0,Interviewer,Interesting. So you have to be able to dance and sing?
702.0,703.0,Subject,"Many times, yeah."
703.0,708.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So then, do you feel like that-- you do both those things, right? So--"
708.0,715.0,Subject,I do. So you'd think it'd be easy but there's a hundred of me out there. All the--
715.0,722.0,Interviewer,There's a hundred of all of us out there. Did you also study singing or--?
722.0,735.0,Subject,No. I never studied singing. Yeah.
735.0,753.0,Interviewer,"So what else about you? What's your life been like lately? It sounded like you've been occupying your time with a lot of these fun new things. You had a recent change, is that right, with work? You were doing something for work recently and then you--?"
753.0,758.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. A couple months ago I was working on Wall Street."
758.0,764.0,Interviewer,"So the last couple months have been different then for you, than before that was, is that right?"
764.0,766.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah.
766.0,770.0,Interviewer,How has that been?
770.0,770.75,Subject,A little challenging.
770.75,771.0,Interviewer,Challenging?
771.0,778.0,Subject,Yeah. Overall pretty good. Yeah.
778.0,779.0,Interviewer,What was it like before?
779.0,793.0,Subject,I guess it was just the daily grind of working on Wall Street 10:00 to 7:00. I was the head of HR at this finance company so not much creativity there.
793.0,802.0,Interviewer,"So creativity is one of the reasons, one of things lacking there that you felt like you wanted to move on to something that had that?"
802.0,803.0,Subject,Yeah.
803.0,808.0,Interviewer,You were the head of HR at the company?
808.0,814.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, it was a fairly small company so it wasn't a lot [inaudible]."
814.0,821.0,Interviewer,So what was it like being the head of HR at that finance company?
821.0,852.0,Subject,"It was sort of a like-- I wouldn't call it a startup because in finance, it's not a startup. But it was sort of like nothing was organized. And, sort of, a lot of things were just, we were figuring it out together. And I found it didn't really work for me because had to create things that I've never done before. I was also new to HR and on top of that, I got no training. So it was just sort of unorganized. Yeah."
852.0,858.0,Interviewer,"You had to, sort of, build this company from scratch? Were you like on the ground floor?"
858.0,865.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, it was around about two years before I got there but-- yeah."
865.0,870.0,Interviewer,But you were frustrated that there wasn't anyone teaching you how to do HR stuff.
870.0,881.0,Subject,"It was a, sort of, I learned from the guy before, kind of thing. But that's why I left, partly. Yeah."
881.0,884.0,Interviewer,Is there anything you enjoyed about it?
884.0,909.0,Subject,"I enjoyed the comradery between individuals working there. My brother was working there. Yeah. So it was nice. There was one individual who was working there who I kind of related to. We had great conversations, and that sort of kept me there. That was, I guess, the good part of it."
909.0,914.0,Interviewer,So you liked some of the people there. Was it fun working with your brother?
914.0,915.0,Subject,I guess.
915.0,916.0,Interviewer,There were pros and cons?
916.0,923.0,Subject,"Yeah. We didn't see each other much, He was very busy all the time so-- yeah."
923.0,930.0,Interviewer,"So you didn't see your brother much but there's one person who you did get along really well with, and you had really good conversations with him?"
930.0,932.0,Subject,Yeah. I'd say it was great.
932.0,934.0,Interviewer,What was good about the conversations?
934.0,946.0,Subject,"It was just deep. We would go really deep into something. We argued a lot but I found it stimulating, like we were sort of on the same path."
946.0,948.0,Interviewer,"You argued a lot in a good way, it sounds like."
948.0,953.0,Subject,"[crosstalk], yeah. Like a debate way. Yeah."
953.0,955.0,Interviewer,What kind of things did you debate about?
955.0,968.0,Subject,"Religion was-- we both grew up very religious and he totally veered off. He's agnostic and I, myself, I like to call myself a miracle-waiting agnostic."
968.0,969.0,Interviewer,Miracle-waiting agnostic?
969.0,975.75,Subject,"Agnostic. So if a miracle happens to pass my way, I might start believing in God but--"
975.75,976.0,Interviewer,Interesting.
976.0,981.0,Subject,--for now I don't know if He exists or if He doesn't. I'm open to it.
981.0,983.0,Interviewer,And maybe He's not even a He at all.
983.0,988.0,Subject,"I was thinking that, too."
988.0,1001.0,Interviewer,"Interesting. So did you-- so you debated sometimes, religious questions. And so you were raised very religious?"
1001.0,1003.0,Subject,Yeah. Modern Orthodox was they called it.
1003.0,1004.0,Interviewer,Modern Orthodox.
1004.0,1004.75,Subject,Yeah.
1004.75,1005.0,Interviewer,Jewish.
1005.0,1008.0,Subject,Jewish. Yeah.
1008.0,1011.0,Interviewer,What was that like being raised like that?
1011.0,1046.0,Subject,"Well, I didn't know anything else. It was I guess, all I knew. When I went to college, I took a gap year after I finished high school. Most Jewish kids at our Jewish school go to Israel for the year. Sort of, they study Judaic studies only, and they have that gap year to really figure themselves out, I guess. When I came back and I went to college right away, I did pretty much get a whole culture shock because I had no idea what studying with boys was. I went to an all-girls school, yeah, what studying with non-Jews was, and it was--"
1046.0,1047.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1047.0,1050.0,Subject,Yeah. So it was--
1050.0,1053.0,Interviewer,So it was a difficult transition when you came back from Israel?
1053.0,1059.0,Subject,It wasn't difficult. It was exciting because I loved the outside world. And I wanted to see it.
1059.0,1060.75,Interviewer,Like an exciting culture shock?
1060.75,1061.0,Subject,Yeah.
1061.0,1069.0,Interviewer,Interesting. Cool. And you were in the city still during the whole time or--
1069.0,1070.0,Subject,In Queens.
1070.0,1071.0,Interviewer,In Queens?
1071.0,1076.0,Subject,Yeah.
1076.0,1090.0,Interviewer,"So what was exciting about the new-- if you can think back to that time, about that culture shock time that you-- I guess, what do you think it was, like the first year of college or--?"
1090.0,1127.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think it was, sort of, boys. I was never close with any boy until I reached college. It was just this like-- I felt almost as if I was like a 13-year-old going through it. Because when you're like 13,14, you start thinking about girls or boys, and there I was like 20 and having my first introduction to boys. I mean, I didn't grow up that sheltered. But-- you know. So it was shocking to just be able to just sit in a classroom with a boy."
1127.0,1134.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And then did it change socially, what your life was like then, during that year?"
1134.0,1149.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. I remember I would go to college maybe eight in the morning. I would drive from Long Island to Queens and I would come in at like 10. And my parents would be like, ""I don't understand. How many classes are you taking?"" But it was--"
1149.0,1152.0,Interviewer,I think classes aren't so late [laughter].
1152.0,1162.0,Subject,"It was just wonderful, just all the friends and different people, and boys, and the girls, and it was just-- it was wonderful."
1162.0,1167.0,Interviewer,So then did that culture shock and excitement wear off at some point?
1167.0,1196.0,Subject,"That's a good question. I think it just grew and it expounded. Because then I started realizing that there's so many different types of people and there's so many different areas of me. I thought I was this one person, and then I was like, wow. I'm so many different people."
1196.0,1207.0,Interviewer,"Oh, so that beginning, that first-- when you came back from that year, it was also-- it was a time of culture shock and learning new things, but also learning about different parts of yourself?"
1207.0,1209.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah.
1209.0,1218.0,Interviewer,Interesting. It opened up doors that it sounds like have stayed open or have opened more doors after that to learn about yourself?
1218.0,1258.0,Subject,"Yeah. Some got closed because I grew up religious, and that still sort of bears a little bit of weight on me. In my community, getting married at a young age is the solution to all the promiscuity. Get married at a young age and you don't have to deal with all these temptations. But I didn't, and I'm not, and I'm still not in that mindset. So there's always a battle, a struggle. Me just hanging out with men is sometimes not-- it's not done in my community at certain hours. So it's something I struggle with even today."
1258.0,1260.0,Interviewer,Does that cause conflicts?
1260.0,1276.0,Subject,"Internally, emotionally, for sure. Sure. But I've sort of gotten to that state of stability where I realized I'm my own person. I'm 28 and I got to make my own decisions regardless of what other people think of me. So--"
1276.0,1280.0,Interviewer,"And with your family, does it cause problems ever, or friends?"
1280.0,1300.0,Subject,Sometimes but they've settled out. They've come to accept it. Yeah.
1300.0,1306.0,Interviewer,"So you feel like things have been pretty good with your family in spite of some of the different views that you've come to, it sounds like."
1306.0,1342.0,Subject,"Yeah, on average, yes. There's a lot of unspokenness. And that's, sort of, the biggest frustration because I can sense that there's a lot of untold angst. But I'm also afraid to talk about it because I know the answer on the other end. I know that my parents have their rigid-- they don't call it rigid, but their viewpoint on how life should be, and I have mine. And it's almost like we agree to disagree and we're not going to talk about to. So-- yeah."
1342.0,1346.0,Interviewer,"So you, sort of, have an unspoken agreement to not let these conflicts arise?"
1346.0,1364.0,Subject,"Yes. Yes. And it almost-- I have this inclination, a plan. I want to make it to Hollywood so eventually, I'm going to move out pretty soon, and just really pursue my passion head-on, and just go for it. So that will really be an issue."
1364.0,1368.0,Interviewer,That's exciting. So where do you think you'll move? You'll stay in the city or you'll move out West?
1368.0,1386.0,Subject,"I think in the beginning, New York, and then-- because I want to film it in New York. I want to film this screenplay in New York or possibly, if money is not an issue, London. So the world is at my fingertips."
1386.0,1392.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's exciting. So it sounds like the most exciting thing you're looking forward to is about the screenplay. Is that right?
1392.0,1395.0,Subject,Yeah. And finding a great director to direct it.
1395.0,1398.0,Interviewer,Okay. You'd be co-directors?
1398.0,1400.0,Subject,"Perhaps, yeah. Yeah."
1400.0,1422.0,Interviewer,"Wow. So it sounds like out of all these, sort of, fun, creative things that you have going on (well, you're moving away from the musicals, but the acting and stuff and the-- well, this is the writing, and the dancing) the writing screenplays is, sort of, the biggest thing that you're thinking about, that's going to be the next way to go."
1422.0,1470.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Even though I'm not really working on it at this moment, this week, last week. But it's in my head and it's coming. I know it's coming. For now, I think these last couple weeks in going forward, I'm really working on healing, taking classes, yoga classes. Just because I feel as if the reason I can't write is because there's almost this blockage of all the years of, sort of, conflict, growing up religious and trying to ease away from it a bit. So I am sort of just releasing all this anxiety and this conflict within. I'm just letting it all go. And I'm almost, I'm certain that once I do that, the writing will just flow and the screenplay-- I mean, the sceenplay's there, it just obviously needs work and whatnot. But--"
1470.0,1474.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. So you're planning, once you do a little bit of healing, to add more to the screenplay?"
1474.0,1475.0,Subject,Of course. Yeah.
1475.0,1477.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay."
1477.0,1480.0,Subject,Yeah.
1480.0,1486.0,Interviewer,"And after you add more to it, then it might be to a point where it'll get picked up by people, you think?"
1486.0,1508.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I do want to self-produce it so-- yeah. I'm hoping to get a great funder and he'll fund it. If you have great content, many times, that's what matters, good storyline. People want to find that because they want to invest in something that they will-- that will do well. So--"
1508.0,1510.0,Interviewer,Do you have a good story line?
1510.0,1515.0,Subject,Yeah. I seem to think so.
1515.0,1518.0,Interviewer,Do you want to share a little bit about it? You don't have to.
1518.0,1526.0,Subject,"Sure. Yeah. I based it quite loosely on the movie, Amélie, the French movie."
1526.0,1527.0,Interviewer,That sounds familiar.
1527.0,1634.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's the movie with Audrey Tautou. She's distinct for her bangs. She has bangs up to here, and she has those big brown eyes. And in the move, she sees the world, the whole movie is her seeing the world through her perspective. And she doesn't really speak a lot, but you can hear her thinking, always her thinking, her talking through her-- not really talking, her thoughts. And she can hear people's thoughts, so to speak. She spies on her neighbors. And it's very charming, I think, a lot because of the music. I find that a great movie has great music. And I based my story line on a young girl that's in high school. She's nearing the end of 12th grade. And she wakes up one day and nothing is going her way, and she realizes that she hasn't spoken a word that whole day. It just happened to be she hasn't spoken. And her parents were just not into listening that day or whatever. And she decides she's not going to talk, so she doesn't talk. So my movie is her going about her day and her week and whatnot, not speaking. It's all through her mind. It's sort of like Amèlie where you can hear her mind. I mean, the music is what I think makes the film because I've chosen a couple of songs that really adds to that almost bossa nova feeling of old-school Brazil, that young girl looking for love. And she's obsessed with this one, I think he's a professor, that has no idea who she is. And then he finally notices her and he takes a liking to her, but she has no idea, and it's just this big jumble. Yeah."
1634.0,1637.0,Interviewer,"Interesting. So it's, sort of, a love story?"
1637.0,1640.0,Subject,Yes. Sort of like a very confused love story.
1640.0,1640.75,Interviewer,A confused love story?
1640.75,1641.0,Subject,Yeah.
1641.0,1645.0,Interviewer,Cool. It sounds like a real exciting premise.
1645.0,1651.0,Subject,I guess.
1651.0,1654.0,Interviewer,Has it been exciting to write?
1654.0,1663.0,Subject,"Yeah. At times, yeah. Sometimes the words just flow and sometimes it's hard."
1663.0,1666.0,Interviewer,What does it feel like when the words are flowing?
1666.0,1694.0,Subject,"It just feels like they're asking me to write them down. It's just stream of consciousness. Just write it down. Most of the time it's easiest when I hear a song that has-- I can picture that song perfectly in that scene and I have to catch it quick because sometimes-- you know it's hard to remember an exact scene in your head if you don't write it down. So when you left to-- I was just like, I got something that I [crosstalk]."
1694.0,1695.0,Interviewer,So you were [crosstalk] there. Cool.
1695.0,1698.0,Subject,"I was just waiting, and then with this scene, I'm like, I'm going to change it to this."
1698.0,1700.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so cool."
1700.0,1704.0,Subject,Yeah. I have to always-- I have this app called Evernote. I don't know if you've heard of it.
1704.0,1706.0,Interviewer,"I've heard of it. I've never quite figured out how to use it, though."
1706.0,1715.0,Subject,"It can be complicated, but I love it because it just categorizes everything. So I have a whole folder for the screenplay. So it's just--"
1715.0,1719.0,Interviewer,So you write things on your paper and then take a picture of them or--?
1719.0,1728.0,Subject,"No. I usually just write it on my phone, but sometimes I like that option, too, of just writing so I can feel it out, and then I just transfer it to the phone."
1728.0,1767.0,Interviewer,Absolutely. So we have about a minute or two left of the informal conversation part. What else didn't I think to ask you about that someone should really want to know to understand what it's like to be you?
1767.0,1773.0,Subject,"That's, I guess, why I decided to do this study."
1773.0,1774.0,Interviewer,Sure.
1774.0,1919.0,Subject,"Because I got that call from Amelia, and she said you were looking for people who have experience, maybe, with the supernatural, or very different recently or-- I think that's what she said, something with supernatural. And I was like, you know what? No. And then I remembered about all these great things were happening, and I was like, that's sort of supernatural. I mean like when you go to [inaudible] without [inaudible]. And oddly enough, after I signed up, really bad things started happening. Honestly, I didn't quantisize it, I didn't record every single thing that's happening. I mean, obviously, it was my mind telling me that this is bad, this is good. All these things are just following each other. It could have just been this is normal, and some of these are just bad, and some of these are good. But I just find it interesting that after I committed to this thing, it was weird. The cycle sort of almost switched to bad. And I was like, aw, shucks. But I told someone just yesterday about this. I was saying, ""Oh, my god. This is bad."" I feel like there's something controlling me. I mean [inaudible] all this stuff, but I was just almost feeling like I'm not having good luck and I'm like, I don't know what to do. Because I'm not really-- I don't really believe so much in fee will, if you will. I find it's a very difficult conversation to have, especially when you're having it with yourself. Because, obviously, it's [inaudible] question to answer when you're having a conversation in your mind. And I've had multiple conversations with other people about free will and determinism. And so I found that I really had no free will in some regards, just not landing certain auditions, and just this cycle of missing trains and missing opportunities. And he told me that all you need is one good day, and that will offset the whole thing and I thought, that is bogus. What is that? And he was like well, you're whole bad day thing could be bogus, too. There's no scientific proof. I'm like, that's true. So [inaudible] and he's like, okay, today is your good day. So I walked in here and I was like, okay. I was listening to The Girl From Ipanema, and I was just like, I just can relax."
1919.0,1920.0,Interviewer,Frank Sinatra?
1920.0,1922.0,Subject,Yeah. Usually it's by Frank Getz.
1922.0,1923.0,Interviewer,The Bossa Nova guy?
1923.0,1924.0,Subject,Yeah. Amazing.
1924.0,1926.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And you hear of the Frank Sinatra version?
1926.0,1928.0,Subject,"I have. It's good, too."
1928.0,1929.0,Interviewer,"Oh, god. It's so good."
1929.0,1933.0,Subject,[inaudible].
1933.0,1937.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Well, we can go ahead and stop there. Sorry, I sort of threw off your train of thought there [crosstalk]."
