1.0,11.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So again, the sense is just to get a sense of how things are for you so why don't you tell me how things have been going for you lately?"
11.0,29.75,Subject,"Sure. So most of the time, I've been in bed since I'm still recovering from the procedure. So I told Dr. [inaudible] about my procedure just in case it was important. So I'm actually a transgender person. So I had the so-called bottom surgery, which is for a vaginoplasty."
29.75,30.0,Interviewer,Cool.
30.0,35.0,Subject,So it's been pretty hard to walk around. But it's been getting a lot better.
35.0,38.0,Interviewer,So what makes it hard to walk around?
38.0,42.0,Subject,"The area is still pretty swollen, and I can't walk nearly as fast as I was able to."
42.0,43.0,Interviewer,Okay.
43.0,45.0,Subject,Which makes me kind of sad because I was pretty active before.
45.0,54.0,Interviewer,Yeah? Is it something that you think will always make you slower or is it about the healing process?
54.0,58.0,Subject,"It's-- at least I hope, it should be healing process."
58.0,70.0,Interviewer,Great. So that's good news. And so why don't you tell me a little bit more about what brought you to this decision and just your experience with it?
70.0,74.0,Subject,Are you asking about my decision regarding this or my procedure?
74.0,78.0,Interviewer,The procedure if you don't mind?
78.0,92.0,Subject,"The procedure was-- because like I told her earlier, that body part just felt really wrong on my body. So I felt disgusted by it and wanted to get rid of it."
92.0,102.0,Interviewer,And so was that something that was hard for you to come to? Was it something that you always felt?
102.0,106.0,Subject,I've always felt that way since probably high school or earlier.
106.0,130.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And do you think since it's happened since you had the procedure, do you think that your life has changed much besides being a little bit less active? How does it make you feel? This was a big decision and you made it. Congratulations."
130.0,152.0,Subject,"Thanks. Well, it's hard to say. I can't really do much right now. Mostly just lying at home, sometimes walking around going to the Teacher's College Library and just lying down there. But yeah. That's mostly it. I'm trying to apply for jobs when I get back home to California. But that hasn't been working out very well."
152.0,154.0,Interviewer,What's not been working out?
154.0,159.0,Subject,The job applications. It's just rejection after rejection all the time.
159.0,162.0,Interviewer,So you're from California.
162.0,163.0,Subject,Yes.
163.0,164.0,Interviewer,What did you do in California?
164.0,195.0,Subject,I grew up there. I went to high school there. I went to undergrad there. And I came here for grad school to study nutrition. And I just want to go back to live with my parents for a bit until I pay off my loans. My goal is to just make some money and then maybe work a year or two and then use up the money I get from working plus most of my savings and pay off my loans as soon as I can.
195.0,200.0,Interviewer,Cool. And so nutrition. Tell me about that.
200.0,223.0,Subject,"I don't really know what I want to do with it. I got into it because I'm pretty interested in eating healthily. I decided partway through it that I didn't want to be a dietitian, which would entail doing a dietetic internship, which would be another year of training plus some schooling and about $10,000 more in debt."
223.0,224.0,Interviewer,Whoa.
224.0,230.0,Subject,"And then taking another test. It's like having sort of like a board exam, I'd say."
230.0,234.0,Interviewer,Whoa. So what is that degree going to do for you?
234.0,258.0,Subject,"It's not really a degree as much as it is a license. So dietitians are legally able to prescribe meal plans and that sort of thing whereas other people in nutrition can't legally do that. I mean, I think we could just make general recommendations but not specific food recommendations."
258.0,268.0,Interviewer,Very cool. And so you think you don't really need that? That's not a piece that you need to do what you want to do?
268.0,277.0,Subject,"I don't think I really need it, and I also don't really want to go back to more training or schooling. Pretty fed up with school at this point in life."
277.0,279.0,Interviewer,What has made you fed up about school?
279.0,332.0,Subject,"I've never really liked it. And I felt like I'm not very good at school. Ever since junior high, I just felt like I wasn't as smart as my classmates. And then I got a lot of bad grades in high school as well. And I actually didn't get into UC Irvine the first time around. I had to make an appeal. And I actually made up an excuse in order to get accepted, which is kind of shady of me. But so it worked. And then I didn't do very well in my first grad program, which was in nursing school. I moved up to a campus at Columbia. So I actually left it because my grades were really bad. And I applied to TC afterwards, I guess, I somehow managed to finish it. My grades at TC weren't very good either. I felt like I had some of the lowest grades in the class."
332.0,335.0,Interviewer,You did? It sounds like you--?
335.0,346.0,Subject,"I don't know, it felt like it. I know I got the lowest grade on one test for my medical nutrition therapy class. And I was one of two people who had to retake it."
346.0,352.0,Interviewer,So you said that you did nursing first. What brought you to that path?
352.0,382.0,Subject,"I was a bio major in college. I didn't know what I wanted to do, so I decided maybe I could try entry-level [inaudible]. Probably should've just done nursing as an undergrad. But I don't think I was able to transfer to that from my current major. And I really just wanted to-- I thought I did-- wanted to work in healthcare and help out people who maybe can't take care of themselves plus I wasn't cut out for that. But whatever."
382.0,394.0,Interviewer,I wouldn't say that. I think you can help people in many different ways. And so what made you transition to TC and doing kind of nutritional work?
394.0,413.0,Subject,"I really want people able to eat healthily. It's a very easy way to take care of their bodies is just learning how to cook by yourself, trying to avoid certain types of food. Maybe not entirely avoid them but eat them once in a while, have a healthier relationship with food."
413.0,415.0,Interviewer,A healthier relationship?
415.0,441.0,Subject,"Yeah. Don't specifically label foods as good or bad. Try not to feel too bad about occasionally snacking once in a while but still focus on eating foods that aren't highly processed and like stuff that if I find a farmer's markets, stuff like that."
441.0,447.0,Interviewer,Interesting. So tell me a little bit more about processed food versus not.
447.0,479.0,Subject,"A lot of foods are processed, but like the ones [inaudible] highly processed ones like you've probably seen them in supermarkets [inaudible] a whole bunch of ingredients that you don't even recognize or when they make pastries with a bunch of ingredients as well. But processed is I guess different from how they processed. Processed would just be like pasteurizing milk or something or making tofu. And that's fine. But personally, I think the fewer the ingredients the better."
479.0,482.0,Interviewer,That's a good rule of thumb.
482.0,488.0,Subject,"Yeah. If you can't pronounce it, you probably don't want to eat it [laughter]."
488.0,497.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I guess. So has eating healthy always been something that you've done? You sound really passionate about that.
497.0,535.0,Subject,"I try to. Honestly, I want to be able to be good enough a cook so I don't have to eat out. I've been pretty ambitious in trying to make things for-- I bought a pressure cooker to make Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup, which is one of the more famous dishes in Taiwan. It's been pretty good, but it takes a lot of time even though it's still with a pressure cooker. And then I had a bunch of ambitious ideas when I went back to California like making my own noodles and that stuff, and it's pretty hard. Mostly [inaudible]."
535.0,537.0,Interviewer,It's hard?
537.0,541.0,Subject,"Well, not hard just time-consuming."
541.0,543.0,Interviewer,What is the process like?
543.0,561.75,Subject,"Making and kneading your own flour using a stand mixer and a mixer, ripping the noodles yourself. So I worked at a place in Chelsea Market that made the wide hand-pulled noodles called Biang Biang noodles, which we're at-- have you been to Xi'an's Famous Foods?"
561.75,562.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
562.0,574.0,Subject,"It's the same types of noodles. So I worked at a place in Chelsea Market which made those noodles. I worked part-time, so I didn't get to practice as much. But I can sort of make them now. I want to try that at home."
574.0,582.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Sounds so good. So did you like your job at Chelsea Market?
582.0,593.75,Subject,It was okay. It helped me a lot in terms of customer service interactions and also working in the kitchen. Except there's a lot of customers who are kind of stupid.
593.75,594.0,Interviewer,Really?
594.0,596.0,Subject,Yes.
596.0,597.0,Interviewer,How?
597.0,619.0,Subject,"Example. They don't read the menu, and they ask me what's on or what's good or they don't look around for the garbage can. And then they always come back to ask us where the garbage can is or we put a sign somewhere near the cart saying that this is not a trash can and then they still put their trash on top of it."
619.0,646.0,Interviewer,Oh. Okay. So learning patience was maybe a valuable skill from that job. That's cool. So I'm getting a good sense of things now. How has your life been different now from maybe before when you were living in California?
646.0,655.0,Subject,"Well, it's still been pretty hard for me to adjust to the city life. I guess, just too busy."
655.0,656.0,Interviewer,Too busy?
656.0,679.0,Subject,"Or too many people. Honestly, I don't think New Yorkers are really that fast. I've never met anyone who walks faster than me. Yeah. So as I am now recovering, it kind of pisses me off seeing myself so slow. But I'm sure I can get back up to speed sooner or later."
679.0,696.0,Interviewer,So it seems like a very emotional thing for you to be slower than you were. Do you think that you were a lot faster? Tell me a little bit more about that.
696.0,710.75,Subject,I was definitely a lot faster. I timed my walking miles in the gym and on the streets. I only timed it once at the gym. Dodge Fitness Center. It was nine minutes [inaudible] start power walking a mile.
710.75,711.0,Interviewer,Wow.
711.0,733.0,Subject,"And I didn't want to time it again just in case I was slower [laughter]. But on the streets when I was just walking with lights and other people and all that, even when it's emptier, I could still go pretty quickly, probably about 11 or 12 minutes per mile for 20 blocks."
733.0,734.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's--
734.0,742.0,Subject,So I was always-- I guess I was in a rush too. But I just don't like wasting time.
742.0,749.0,Interviewer,That's fair. Do you think that New York is a place that people waste time?
749.0,757.0,Subject,"No. I don't think so. But some people get in my way. I mean, of course not intentionally, but it just seems like--"
757.0,759.0,Interviewer,So many people.
759.0,764.0,Subject,--there are so many people you could at least move out of the way for people faster.
764.0,768.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, like cars have lanes, fast lanes."
768.0,777.0,Subject,"At least for me, as I am right now, I try to move out of people's way so if they're going faster than me. I guess not everyone wants to."
777.0,785.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what else about New York is kind of hard to adjust to for you?
785.0,788.0,Subject,Summers. It's really hot.
788.0,791.0,Interviewer,Really? I feel like California is super hot.
791.0,797.0,Subject,"California's pretty hot, but it's dry heat. This is very humid."
797.0,799.0,Interviewer,Gotcha.
799.0,839.0,Subject,"And I grew up in a place with mostly Asians and Asian-Americans. So it's actually kind of weird. When I came here, I guess it was sort of a culture shock in a sense like where are all the Asian-Americans? But now, I'm pretty used to it. But in my program, there were some Chinese people, and I've been trying to practice my Chinese more so I've been speaking to them in Chinese. So I feel like when I go back to California, it might be weird talking to Asian-Americans who are-- I don't really know their languages as well as Asians in speaking to them in English."
839.0,842.0,Interviewer,Sorry. So they don't know what?
842.0,871.0,Subject,"So I think of the Asians and Asian-Americans as different people. So here, I speak with Chinese people in Chinese. At least I try to. And going back to California, I think there's more Chinese and Taiwanese-Americans than Chinese and Taiwanese. But they look pretty similar sometimes. So I feel like it'll be weird speaking to people ethnically Taiwanese or Chinese in English."
871.0,880.75,Interviewer,"Oh. I see. So like going back, you'll have more Chinese-American or Taiwanese-American friends that you'll be speaking to in--"
880.75,881.0,Subject,English.
881.0,884.0,Interviewer,--English. Okay. And so that's confusing to you based on what's happened here?
884.0,885.0,Subject,Yeah.
885.0,894.0,Interviewer,Okay. Interesting. So you're practicing here. Is that not something you did at home?
894.0,912.0,Subject,I talked with my parents in Chinese but interestingly enough my mom seems to not want us to do that as much anymore. I don't know-- she still insists on using English with me even though there are words I can say in Chinese now that I didn't before.
912.0,913.0,Interviewer,After coming to New York?
913.0,914.0,Subject,Yeah.
914.0,916.0,Interviewer,Oh. Interesting.
916.0,922.0,Subject,I've been trying to read articles on modern Chinese just to practice. It's pretty hard.
922.0,935.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's very cool. So it sounds like you really want to be very fluent. What's the rationale behind that?
935.0,957.0,Subject,I feel like language is probably the most important part of a culture. And it seems like a waste if you can't talk with people in the culture. And it seems kind of sad at least for certain Chinese or Taiwanese-Americans who grew up here and go back to their parents' or grandparents' homeland and can't speak with [inaudible].
957.0,961.0,Interviewer,Is that something you've experienced?
961.0,970.0,Subject,"Well, I haven't since I could speak the language. But my sister doesn't speak it as well. She can't really talk to my grandparents or cousin."
970.0,973.0,Interviewer,"Oh, really? She can't but you can?"
973.0,985.0,Subject,Yeah because I can-- I still kept practicing. I practiced on my own after high school just reading comics and other stuff in Chinese in trying to practice.
985.0,995.0,Interviewer,Very cool. So did you guys have schooling for Chinese before or was it something that you really just kind of did on your own?
995.0,999.0,Subject,We went to Chinese school when we were kids. But we stopped pretty early on.
999.0,1000.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you did?"
1000.0,1016.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think as a kid, I didn't like it maybe because I was forced into it. I don't know. But being a kid is the best time to learn. I wish I had learned more Chinese and also other languages when I was younger."
1016.0,1020.0,Interviewer,Me too. And you never know until it's too late that you should be doing it.
1020.0,1027.0,Subject,"Now it's too bad. If we could go back in time, that's one thing I want to do. I don't know about you."
1027.0,1048.0,Interviewer,"Me too. Interesting. Okay. So what do you see for yourself moving forward? So you want to move back to California, and after paying off your debt, what do you see yourself doing?"
1048.0,1078.0,Subject,"That's way too long-term. I don't even know when I'll get a job. But to answer your question, I would like to move to another part of the world and work probably East Asia, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Korea-- I don't know. I want to learn Japanese and Korean, but it's kind of hard. And I want to focus on Chinese first. So I'm not sure that's going to happen. I would like to try practicing the other languages once I have more resources."
1078.0,1085.0,Interviewer,Oh. So what do you think is drawing you there specifically to East Asia?
1085.0,1121.0,Subject,"There's this cute culture in places like Japan and a focus on youth even though I'm not as young anymore, late 20s. I feel like-- I actually wrote a blog post about it on my blog earlier today. I just want to try keeping my youth as much as possible to get back the lost time I wasted by not transitioning earlier in life or by not being born female."
1121.0,1124.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1124.0,1129.0,Subject,I do have some sort of obsession with youth. Were you going to say something?
1129.0,1152.0,Interviewer,"No. No. I was just wondering you mentioned wasted time, and I just wanted to ask you a little bit more about how you feel it was wasted and your feelings about just generally starting anew?"
1152.0,1269.0,Subject,"It's definitely easy for me to be specific about wasted time. So I graduated undergrad in 2013. I decided to apply for nursing school. But I didn't take the GRE until after graduating. So 2013 was just finishing up taking the rest of my prereqs, and then in 2014, in January, I took the GRE, did some volunteering, tried working after I finished volunteering, which was a disaster. It was hard to find a job. So I basically just kind of tutored a family friend's nephew because he was from Taiwan and came here for high school. That's mostly what I did. It wasn't that much. And then I went to nursing school in 2015. It was a disaster. My grades were really bad. And I left before getting kicked out. So that was basically a waste of time. So I went back to California after that. That was November of 2015 when I went back to California. I applied immediately for TC's program. So I got in, and it felt like I couldn't do anything. The first half of 2016 was pointless. And I kept trying to look for more jobs, but it didn't work out. So I went to some temp agencies and looked for jobs. I got some, but they didn't pay very well. I don't know how much experience I got from them. So that's mostly it. And then I tried really hard looking for work-study jobs while I was at TC and also other part-time jobs, but they didn't work very well. None of the work-study jobs got back to me. So the only jobs I had was the job I had at Chelsea Market from November until April. And I also had a proctoring job at the Office of Disabilities at TC."
1269.0,1271.0,Interviewer,"Oh, cool."
1271.0,1281.0,Subject,"So nothing really happened in my life. And to answer your question about starting anew now, I wish I did it earlier."
1281.0,1282.0,Interviewer,You do?
1282.0,1293.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I've seen some YouTubers who started transitioning while they're late high-schoolers, just 10 years younger than me."
1293.0,1299.0,Interviewer,And so what does that-- how is it different?
1299.0,1302.0,Subject,I suppose my interaction with people would've been different in high school.
1302.0,1307.0,Interviewer,Different how?
1307.0,1328.0,Subject,"Maybe I would've had more female friends because I always like talking with girls more. But it was a lot harder for them to accept me, I guess. Now, it's a lot easier to make friends with girls. I think people tell me I pass pretty well as a [inaudible]."
1328.0,1333.0,Interviewer,I most definitely think of you as completely a woman.
1333.0,1335.0,Subject,[inaudible].
1335.0,1340.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you've always felt more comfortable with girls?
1340.0,1342.0,Subject,Yes.
1342.0,1343.0,Interviewer,How so?
1343.0,1355.0,Subject,"I have no idea, just easier to talk to them. And I always feel awkward around guys. I have no idea why. Just I guess I just don't have anything to talk about except video games."
1355.0,1356.0,Interviewer,"Oh, do you play video games?"
1356.0,1363.0,Subject,I did as a kid. I play less not. But I still listen to video game music a lot.
1363.0,1364.0,Interviewer,"Oh, what's that?"
1364.0,1367.0,Subject,Just the soundtracks in video games.
1367.0,1368.0,Interviewer,"Oh, they publish them?"
1368.0,1369.0,Subject,Yes.
1369.0,1372.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's cool. So you can get them on iTunes?"
1372.0,1378.0,Subject,Yeah or on YouTube. I bought some CDs [inaudible]. It's pretty cool.
1378.0,1392.75,Interviewer,"Oh. Yeah. That's awesome. I got totally derailed. What were you talking about? Oh, wasted time, and yeah. So your interactions would've been different in high school."
1392.75,1393.0,Subject,Yeah.
1393.0,1396.0,Interviewer,"And you feel like they're different now, though?"
1396.0,1406.0,Subject,"Somewhat. I mean, one one hand it's easier to talk with girls. On the other hand, I feel like I'm not really treated that much differently."
1406.0,1408.0,Interviewer,No. That's interesting.
1408.0,1417.0,Subject,Except being on the streets is a little more annoying. You know how people sometimes just randomly say stuff or call out to women on the streets?
1417.0,1420.0,Interviewer,"Oh, like cat-calling."
1420.0,1429.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't think everybody is cat-calling, but there's people who definitely stared at me or just said hi randomly, which has never happened before, which is kind of annoying."
1429.0,1430.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It's annoying.
1430.0,1433.0,Subject,I'd rather not talk to strangers if I don't have to.
1433.0,1441.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Is that a strictly New York thing? Has that happened only here?
1441.0,1447.0,Subject,"I guess so. In California, we just drive everywhere. So we don't really walk on the streets."
1447.0,1454.0,Interviewer,"So if you like walking and being active, you must like-- do you prefer the California method or the New York walking method?"
1454.0,1481.0,Subject,"I prefer walking but having a car in all those crowded places would also be nice. I don't know. I think being able to walk everywhere is better because it makes you more active. I feel like in the cities where you do have to walk everywhere, driving would be a huge pain."
1481.0,1503.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Definitely. So I got further derailed from my first question I guess, which was very long-term question. But if you could just zoom ahead five years, what would you like to be doing?"
1503.0,1520.0,Subject,I would like to have paid off my loans already and be working somewhere outside of the US just to make up for the time I was not able to travel because [inaudible] off.
1520.0,1526.0,Interviewer,So travel is something that you really want to do. Why do you think that is?
1526.0,1549.0,Subject,"There are just so many parts of the world that I've never been to. It'd be pretty interesting seeing different types of food that people have or I don't know, what the different places look like. Recently, I've been watching Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown show on Netflix. And it's pretty interesting."
1549.0,1552.0,Interviewer,Yeah? Can you tell me about it? I haven't seen it.
1552.0,1566.0,Subject,"He just went to a lot of different countries and talked with really just people who he randomly met or people he already knew there. He talked about their culture and the foods they ate, their history, which is pretty cool."
1566.0,1572.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That is cool. So you want to be an Anthony Bourdain.
1572.0,1580.0,Subject,I don't think so. I just want to be able to go to places with friends from time to time.
1580.0,1585.0,Interviewer,So do you have friends that you do travel with now or you'd like to travel with?
1585.0,1591.0,Subject,I would like to travel with I guess my neighbor. I've known him since sixth grade. We're the same age.
1591.0,1594.0,Interviewer,Oh. That's so nice.
1594.0,1606.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I guess going with him, his girlfriend whom I talk to pretty often as well to places like Taiwan, Japan that would be pretty fun."
1606.0,1615.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So wow. You guys have known each a really long time. And you were in California, and now you're here together?"
1615.0,1617.0,Subject,"Oh, no. He's still in California."
1617.0,1620.0,Interviewer,Okay. Okay. Do you talk to him often?
1620.0,1623.0,Subject,Yeah. I talk to him pretty often. He was here a few weeks ago.
1623.0,1626.0,Interviewer,"Oh, fun. What did you guys do?"
1626.0,1635.0,Subject,"Well, I wasn't able to do much because I could barely walk at the time. But we still went out to eat something and went to GameStop and we bought the Nintendo Switch. We're going to share it when I go back."
1635.0,1636.0,Interviewer,Nintendo Switch?
1636.0,1640.0,Subject,It's one of the newer consoles.
1640.0,1644.0,Interviewer,I know nothing about video games. Can you help me?
1644.0,1657.0,Subject,It's interesting. You can change it from a hand-held console or you could dock it on something that looks like this and connect it to a TV.
1657.0,1661.0,Interviewer,Oh. And so then where do the controls go?
1661.0,1673.0,Subject,"The controllers are on the side of the Nintendo Switch usually. If you play on the held-held, they're [inaudible] on the side, but you can also remove them, and then you could play on them when it's docked."
1673.0,1676.0,Interviewer,Oh. So what kinds of games do you play?
1676.0,1687.0,Subject,"I play mostly RPGs, role-playing games, turn-based. You play like Pokemon just turn-based. One person attacks. The other person attacks."
1687.0,1688.0,Interviewer,Attacks how?
1688.0,1691.0,Subject,You slot a move or some skill.
1691.0,1692.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay."
1692.0,1711.0,Subject,"It's pretty simple. But there is a lot of turn-based games I find are really fun. But I don't really play that much anymore. I like watching other people play, so I don't have to think on my own and so I could listen to the music."
1711.0,1719.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you mentioned this twice now. So is it different than music that you couldn't hear otherwise? What draws you to that music?
1719.0,1745.0,Subject,"I don't know. Most of the time, it's because the music is associated with some sort of [inaudible]. I've played the game in the past. Hearing it orchestrated bring back those nice memories or if it's games I haven't played before, I just like how they sound. And I don't like music with lyrics in them as much because they distract me."
1745.0,1746.0,Interviewer,They distract you?
1746.0,1748.0,Subject,Yes.
1748.0,1751.0,Interviewer,How?
1751.0,1756.0,Subject,"I usually listen to music when I'm studying. But if there's lyrics in the background, I cannot concentrate at all."
1756.0,1760.0,Interviewer,I see. Okay. So it's like a multi-tasking thing.
1760.0,1771.0,Subject,Yeah. I think I'm pretty good at multitasking. I could text while talking to someone. But that kind of thing listening to lyrics while studying is really hard.
1771.0,1778.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That is hard. So what kinds of happy memories do these songs bring back?
1778.0,1784.0,Subject,"Fun, boss battles or exploring a new area for the first time as a kid."
1784.0,1785.0,Interviewer,In the game?
1785.0,1786.0,Subject,Yeah.
1786.0,1792.0,Interviewer,"Oh, fun. Very cool. And so that's something that's a big part of your childhood?"
1792.0,1794.0,Subject,Yeah. It was.
1794.0,1797.0,Interviewer,In what way? Did you just play a lot? Was it social?
1797.0,1843.0,Subject,"I played a lot. It's a lot more social like some games on the computer. There's this thing called MMORPGs massively or something multiplayer online RPG or something. I don't know. So there is an old one called Maplestory, which is a Korean game that came out in early 2003 or 2004. At the time, it was really popular, and a lot of the people in my high school played it. And we'd just play it after school, talk to each other and explore areas, train together. Now, it's not the same anymore. I kind of wish I could go back to that time especially as a kid. It felt more magical."
1843.0,1844.0,Interviewer,More magical.
1844.0,1862.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's like a new game for the first time. You're 13 years old, exploring. It's such a fun game with other players. Well, I don't really think the game's fun anymore unless the graphics are really cute and the music was nice too."
1862.0,1873.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Do you ever get that sense of an exciting, magical, new feeling when you play a new game now?"
1873.0,1874.75,Subject,"Not really, honestly."
1874.75,1875.0,Interviewer,No?
1875.0,1882.0,Subject,"So I just like watching other people play and seeing if I'll like the game. When it looks like I'll like it, I'll play it myself."
1882.0,1884.0,Interviewer,But you don't get the same feeling?
1884.0,1887.0,Subject,No. I'm getting too old for this.
1887.0,1892.0,Interviewer,"No. No. Definitely not. No, there's a child in everyone, right?"
1892.0,1894.0,Subject,Yeah.
