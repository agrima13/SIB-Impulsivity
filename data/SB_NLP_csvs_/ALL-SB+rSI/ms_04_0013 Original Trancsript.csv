0.0,2.0,Interviewer,We all make mistakes [laughter].
2.0,5.0,Subject,Yeah. So how are things going for you?
5.0,20.0,Interviewer,"Everything's all right, right now. As of right now, I went to the college class today, and it was really boring, to be honest."
20.0,21.0,Subject,College class?
21.0,80.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It's photography I'm taking. There wasn't really anything other than that class to really choose, because there was drawing. There was supposed to be keyboard, which I actually decided to want to take, but it was canceled due to renovations in the college and such. So really I had to choose art. And art, which was drawing, or choose photography. Really, I chose photography because people say it was really more easier and such. But it was more boring, they say. I'd say, yeah, it was boring [laughter]."
80.0,81.0,Subject,How was it boring?
81.0,124.0,Interviewer,"Really, the professor for photography was, I guess you could just say, an old person teaching you a camera. I wouldn't really say that I didn't like her or I did like her, because it was really the first day for me and such. And I had already lost a lot due to last week. That's when they started to already say all the things I needed and such. And then--"
124.0,125.0,Subject,What have you lost?
125.0,136.0,Interviewer,I was not there last week in the day when they were actually starting it. So I lost a lot of information and such.
136.0,138.0,Subject,Oh. What were you doing that day?
138.0,160.0,Interviewer,"I was in Mexico, and I actually thought that, oh, we were going to leave Friday or Thursday, because soon there's going to be school and such. But no, it was still Saturday I had to come back. So it was a major pain for me."
160.0,162.0,Subject,"Oh, sorry."
162.0,215.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It's not really your fault, to be honest [laughter]. It was really my mom and my dad not really mentioning this to me. Because they said that, ""Oh, don't worry. You're going to be back before the college classes start."" And they ended up not doing that. They just forgot and such, they just said to me. Yeah. So I lost a lot of information. The good thing is that one of my friends was there to back me up with a bit of it, because they were lazy to really pay attention and such. So I guess you could say I lost a friend that day [laughter]."
215.0,216.0,Subject,"Oh, no."
216.0,235.0,Interviewer,"I'm just kidding. No. No. I'm still friends with him and such. Yeah. I just don't trust him more than I did before that day, so."
235.0,238.0,Subject,Has he done something untrustworthy?
238.0,241.0,Interviewer,"No, it's because he didn't really tell me all the information."
241.0,243.0,Subject,"No, I mean before that. [crosstalk]."
243.0,254.0,Interviewer,"No. No. It's just the first time this ever happened to me and such, so. But it was all right in the end, to be honest. Yeah."
254.0,259.0,Subject,Good. What were you doing in Mexico?
259.0,289.75,Interviewer,"I was walking around, you could just say, going to parks, zoos, the beach, the pools. They were nice and such. Yeah. Wouldn't really say that they are the best, because-- I don't know how to really put this into words, or if it's either inappropriate, but--"
289.75,290.0,Subject,[inaudible].
290.0,295.0,Interviewer,"--I'm just going to say-- yeah, I'm not going to even say it [laughter]."
295.0,296.0,Subject,You can say whatever.
296.0,298.0,Interviewer,You could just say birthday suits.
298.0,299.0,Subject,Okay.
299.0,301.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Birthday suits.
301.0,304.0,Subject,That's funny. So all the beaches are like that?
304.0,362.0,Interviewer,"No. I'm just saying that the beaches I went, some of them were birthday suit beaches, or just basically people were just in their birthday suits [laughter] and such. And it was just somewhat stressful in a way, just trying to look away while trying to have fun as well. But in the end, it was joyful. Yeah. With being in Mexico, it's a lot different, like so much that I just think that if I should really compare it to New York and such, because there are different backgrounds to them and such."
362.0,363.0,Subject,What do you mean by background?
363.0,426.0,Interviewer,"As in, New York had lesser nature. There's less trees and such. It was more flourished with people and buildings and such. As for Mexico, where I've been, which was Acapulco, there was more trees and such. It was more flourished with nature, yet lesser people and such. There was still cities and such, but they're far away from where I was living. Yeah. It was really interesting, to be honest, especially when you've not been there for many years and such. And to come back, it's really surprising."
426.0,428.0,Subject,When was the last time you were there?
428.0,481.0,Interviewer,"I remember it was basically when my sister was just a year old. So it was seven years or possibly eight. Yeah. A lot of things changed then. There was basically fixed buildings. The roads were more fixed. There was still more nature and such. Yeah. Lesser stray dogs, some of their cats are strayed over there [laughter] [inaudible]. And, yeah, basically done."
481.0,484.0,Subject,Are you glad to be back in New York?
484.0,492.75,Interviewer,"Somewhat [laughter]. Yeah. To come back, it's surprising."
492.75,493.0,Subject,Surprising?
493.0,506.0,Interviewer,"Because even though if you've just been to Mexico, in two weeks, everything just seems so new when you just come back and such."
506.0,507.0,Subject,What do you mean new?
507.0,524.0,Interviewer,"As in that you just forget everything about New York after just two weeks, and it's somewhat worrying [laughter] what to do and such."
524.0,526.0,Subject,What do you mean worrying?
526.0,551.0,Interviewer,"Because I was more used to lesser people and less traffic, as to coming back to New York, when just going back home, there's already traffic at the start. And just seeing many roads and such."
551.0,554.0,Subject,Do you drive? How do you get stuck in traffic?
554.0,613.0,Interviewer,"Just driving and such. It was, I think, around 7:00 or 8:00 we came back. And my mom was driving in car, going to the highway from JFK, just going back home in Manhattan and such. It was just a lot, to be honest. Not like a lot, enough to take hours and such, but just more like lasting longer than five minutes and such. But I would say that if either side I had to go to, I would still miss both of them anyways, even with Dominican Republic as well, along with it."
613.0,615.0,Subject,When were you there?
615.0,647.0,Interviewer,"Dominican Republic, it would be recently. I would say at probably around a year ago. Somewhere around that timeframe, really, because I remember driving there, even though I wasn't even old enough to."
647.0,648.0,Subject,"Oh, you were driving?"
648.0,680.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I was driving in Dominican Republic, since there wasn't really that much of a law enforcing age and such. So I'd just be seeing children bikes with their friends on them and such, just going to places. And just to see me in a car, looking at them, is just like un-normal to me [laughter]."
680.0,683.0,Subject,Yeah. That's crazy.
683.0,747.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. To see basically lesser laws enforced in Dominican Republic, and just seeing laws here, it just seems like, is there freedom in New York [laughter]? Is there freedom, really? Because I just be seeing children driving motorcycles at midnight at Dominican Republic, and just seeing here just adults and such just only riding cars. Yeah. But yet, I just say that New York is still more safer, because guns and such. I'm not saying that there was shootings and such, just more like you could still own a gun in Dominican Republic so easily."
747.0,749.0,Subject,There was more access to guns?
749.0,752.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
752.0,755.75,Subject,Did you see anybody with a gun?
755.75,756.0,Interviewer,In--?
756.0,757.0,Subject,The DR.
757.0,866.0,Interviewer,"In DR? I didn't see any shootings or people just trying to rob and such, but I just been hearing it from just news in DR, or just basically just discussions from my family in DR, just basically saying someone died nearby in our neighborhood. And just like, what, and such. It's kind of, I guess, worrying, because there was also a hurricane that struck in DR, and I was still there. And I thought, oh no, I'm just going to die right now. But it ends up being all rain and such. Yeah. It was not that much of a hurricane. There was not a lot of damage, to be honest, just very minor damage. And I was relieved from that and such, to experience a hurricane for the first time, to be passing by. And in New York, it's just possibly not even in touch. Yeah. With just New York, and Mexico, and DR, there are many differences. One is more safer than the others, one is more fun than the others and such."
866.0,869.0,Subject,Which one was the most fun?
869.0,875.0,Interviewer,"I don't [laughter]-- to be honest, I just don't really want to answer that, because I would say all of them. I would say all of them were fun in their own ways. Yeah."
875.0,887.0,Subject,I don't want to make you choose. Okay. Very diplomatic. So it seems like you've traveled a lot. Do you enjoy that?
887.0,929.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Sometimes. Like I said, I always miss the other one, no matter what, because I've lived in one in one certain place, and the others are just where my family lives in. As in, my mom was born in DR, I was born in New York, while my dad was born in Mexico. It's really interesting, to be honest, just to see back stories and such."
929.0,930.0,Subject,Bad stories?
930.0,931.0,Interviewer,No. Back stories.
931.0,932.0,Subject,"Oh, back stories."
932.0,974.0,Interviewer,"Yes. To where they [laughter]-- from them going to New York, and to see how they experienced it, how they experienced their childhood to where they were born and such. Yeah. It's, to be honest, really interesting to see their stories, and just to see mine, how they are similar, or how they are different."
974.0,978.0,Subject,What ways do you think they're different?
978.0,1021.0,Interviewer,"A lot of things. Yeah. With my mom, it would really be, with her in her childhood, she would always be around in the streets playing with other children. And with my dad, he would just say that he's just been staying at home and helping his family and such. See how his childhood was more serious than my childhood."
1021.0,1022.0,Subject,More serious?
1022.0,1047.0,Interviewer,"More serious. Yeah. As in, there were days, yeah, he would say that he went around and played with friends and such. But mainly he would just say that he would just be with his family, carrying them and such."
1047.0,1049.0,Subject,Carrying them?
1049.0,1052.0,Interviewer,"Carry. I mean, care for them. Yeah."
1052.0,1053.0,Subject,Caring. Okay.
1053.0,1060.0,Interviewer,"Carry for-- ah [laughter]. Caring, yes, for them."
1060.0,1062.0,Subject,Caring for them how?
1062.0,1109.0,Interviewer,"Like doing work at a young age, just selling at fruit stands. Yeah. Things like that, just ways to make money or just any way he could help out in the house. While my mom just really doing some of everything she just wanted to do, in a way. Because I know there's obviously restrictions in some certain parts with her family."
1109.0,1110.0,Subject,Restriction?
1110.0,1116.0,Interviewer,As in to not kill anybody or something.
1116.0,1117.0,Subject,That's a good one [laughter].
1117.0,1144.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I don't really know. She would just say that, of course, she would have restrictions and such from her mom and her dad. As with her mom, she was more strict on her, while her dad was more calm and such."
1144.0,1146.0,Subject,Can you relate to that?
1146.0,1176.0,Interviewer,"Somewhat, in a way. Yeah. I would say that my parents are more of a mix. Well, mainly my mom, yeah, sometimes she's serious. Sometimes she is really caring. While with my dad, it's really strict and such. Yeah. Since he's been--"
1176.0,1177.0,Subject,"Strict, how?"
1177.0,1241.0,Interviewer,"As in with him working and such, just to make sure to be a bit like a better representation to your siblings. Or basically make sure you do your chores so that you could represent them, think that they should do their chores as well. Just things for me to be a better big brother and such. Yeah. To really experience being a big brother, and to have a little sister and a little brother, just to have a mix of a siblings, it's really fun in a way. There are sometimes stressful days and such."
1241.0,1242.0,Subject,Stressful?
1242.0,1295.0,Interviewer,"Because I have to be taking care of them. Yeah. It's, I would say, not easy being a big brother and all, to really be a good representation, and to also care for them, to also be fun for them, just to prevent them from hating me, I would really say. And they, obviously, don't hate me. Yeah. It's nice that they would care for me a lot. Mainly my sister, really."
1295.0,1296.0,Subject,Yeah?
1296.0,1327.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. With my brother, I would say, yeah, he cares for me a lot. Sometimes he doesn't, because we teasing him a lot [laughter] and such. As for my sister, always just caring for her and less teasing."
1327.0,1329.0,Subject,How do you care for them?
1329.0,1388.0,Interviewer,"Really, I would care for them in any way. Like with my sister, I always be the one just helping her with homework, or helping her with school, giving her help with many things. Like if she needed anything from me, she would sometimes have it, depending on what she wants and such. Because I'm not Santa Claus, and I don't have everything [laughter] and such. And for my brother, he doesn't really pay attention to me that much. Not like he hates me and such. Just more of him being much of a gamer, you could just say."
1388.0,1391.0,Subject,You're not a gamer?
1391.0,1429.75,Interviewer,"No. I wouldn't really say that, to be honest, because I mainly read and write. While he's just video games. There are times, yeah, I would just play on my phone, or play on anything else that is not reading a book or writing. But mainly I would rather decide on having my own ideas written, or reading interesting books like Red Rising."
1429.75,1430.0,Subject,What's that?
1430.0,1575.75,Interviewer,"A book about humanity, and Mars, and the future, once earth was inhabitable. How to see it being a different society, in a way. As with the present, there's somewhat of a fairness, enough to be, you could say, equal. As with Red Rising, it shows that different colors are ranks, as gold being the highest rank, and red being the lowest. And how the main character finds the truth that he is a red and such, that they are being enslaved. And that to free the reds, as they say, he must become the enemy that he hated, which was the golds. To see how he becomes, they say, the society, the perfection of humanity. It's really stressful for him and such to see how in order to save his family and his friends, basically his kind, he has to become the enemy he always hated, due to them killing his father and almost all of his family and such, being unfair. And to recently see his wife die, it's really--"
1575.75,1576.0,Subject,[inaudible].
1576.0,1603.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It's really an interesting book to see, especially when it's multiple books of it, that there's more continuation to it, like Red Rising, Golden Son. And I forgot the last one and such. But, yeah."
1603.0,1605.0,Subject,"So you like to read, obviously."
1605.0,1606.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1606.0,1610.0,Subject,"Is this kind of-- is it science fiction, or what would you call it?"
1610.0,1613.75,Interviewer,"Red Rising, it's science fiction. Yeah."
1613.75,1614.0,Subject,[crosstalk].
1614.0,1654.0,Interviewer,"But there's other books that I like to read, mainly biographies, my favorite, to be honest, or just in any way that brings reality and such. Like books that bring out truth in society, or bringing out, in a way, some realism and such, and to also see other people's perspectives."
1654.0,1659.0,Subject,Cool. Why do you think you like those books in particular?
1659.0,1808.75,Interviewer,"Biographies were, I wouldn't really say my interest, because I know in the past, I always wanted to be an engineer. Because I know before, I wanted to be a scientist and do some chemistry. Then I later on wanted to become an engineer for coding and such. To now, it's really unknown, to be honest, because I now have interest to become maybe a singer, or be an actor, or to be a writer, to now also being a photographer. That there are many, many things that I have to really decide on, really, to have the rest be hobbies or anything else. Yeah. Biographies were really somewhat of a change to me, to see how other people's lives were, and to compare it to me. I wouldn't really say it's a biography, but more like an artist, to see publishing his poems that he wrote in the past, to later on, still continue writing poems. And surprisingly, to know, the person was actually Tupac [laughter]. Yeah. To see a rapper write poems, it was really interesting to see how they published it and such, to see how he wrote these poems himself in the past, and still continue writing poems secretly."
1808.75,1809.0,Subject,Secretly? That's funny.
1809.0,1844.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Because there was still poems in the book that had his poems, that to see till right before he actually died, the day before. Surprisingly, the last poem he made was how he would die soon."
1844.0,1846.0,Subject,"Oh, he said that in the poem?"
1846.0,1877.0,Interviewer,"He said that in the poem. To really say the future for him was really interesting, like he knew he would die the day later on. And, yeah, that made me decide to really have more interest in poems and biographies and such. Yeah."
