1.0,8.0,Interviewer,Okay. So the first question I'm going to ask you is just how have things been going for you lately?
8.0,54.0,Subject,"Things have been going good. I've been working from home, and kind of just going about my day as the whole pandemic-- I feel like it's getting better. So I'm feeling a little hopeful, but I've also been sick. So I've been going to some doctor's appointments, and just doing that and working. Yeah."
54.0,61.0,Interviewer,I'm so sorry to hear that. What is it like to be sick during this time?
61.0,112.0,Subject,"It's kind of scary just because going to the doctors' offices, and I've had to have-- I've had to go to the ER a couple of times. So thankfully that was in the summer. So it wasn't too hectic in the hospital. But it's something that I'd rather not do right now, but I have no other choice. So yeah, it's not as bad as I was afraid of. Yeah. But I would rather not be dealing with this during a pandemic."
112.0,120.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Of course. And so in what ways was it not as bad as you anticipated?
120.0,157.0,Subject,"I thought the hospital was going to be more hectic, like how you see on the news, but the times that I've been there everything has been pretty good, has seemed really calm, and the doctors seem not rushed. It doesn't seem as full. So I guess that's what I saw on the TV. Like, ""Oh, hospitals are understaffed, and they're going crazy right now,"" but no. It's been okay."
157.0,171.0,Interviewer,"Good. I'm glad to hear that. And so what kind of is this illness, and how has it been affecting other parts of your life?"
171.0,240.0,Subject,"So it's just something that happened four months ago. I had food stuck in my mouth, and I had to go to the hospital because of that. And then at the hospital, they decided, like, ""Oh, let's do an endoscopy,"" which I kind of didn't know much about, and I thought it was fine. Just a procedure like normal. And the doctor was like, ""Yeah. It's routine,"" and my family was not concerned about me doing it, but it turned out to be-- I was fine before that, completely fine, no health issues at all, and then the day afterward I was in just so much pain and dizzy and horrible. Couldn't walk. And it's been like that for, like, four months. So yeah, I've been to a ton of specialists, and they don't know what's happening. It's been hard. Yeah."
240.0,262.0,Interviewer,"Wow. I can imagine. So after the endoscopy, it sounds like, is when things went really kind of bad. How have you been-- what was that experience like, to kind of go through a procedure, and then somehow be worse?"
262.0,326.0,Subject,"I mean, it was kind of gradual at first because you have a recovery period, I guess. So I thought it was just part of the recovery period. You're supposed to feel groggy for the day afterward because of the anesthesia and everything, but yeah, it felt like things were fine. I did think it was weird that I felt dizzy because it's kind of like a vertigo sensation. I've never had that before. So I'm waking up. I'm like, ""What is happening?"" But I thought it was just normal. So things happened gradually. The pain just didn't go away, and then it got worse. And so did the dizziness. I noticed that I couldn't walk for a few blocks, even after the time that it says that you're supposed to recover. So yeah, it was kind of weird and gradual."
326.0,331.0,Interviewer,And how are you feeling now?
331.0,341.0,Subject,I'm still feeling the same as from the day after the procedure. The same symptoms.
341.0,344.0,Interviewer,And it's been months.
344.0,347.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's been, like, five months."
347.0,376.0,Interviewer,"Wow. And please let me know [inaudible] it kind of comes up at any point, we can pause or take a break or stop. Whatever you need. But I'm so sorry. That sounds so difficult. So are you experiencing it any less? What is it kind of-- how is it impacting your life? It sounds quite bad."
376.0,466.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's just impacted everything. Thankfully, I've been working from home. Before that, I was working hybrid. I would go into the office sometimes. And now, I'm basically just-- have to be home all the time because I can't really walk. I can't really do much. It hurts to walk for a few blocks. So I have to get delivery, and just it's been horrible financially. And the doctors can't seem to find what's wrong, and they haven't been too helpful. So my trust in doctors has diminished, and it's been hard. But thankfully my family is really supportive. And yeah, work hasn't been impacted so much, but I have other things that I haven't been able to do just because I've been in so much pain. I can't really concentrate because of it. Yeah. I think you're on mute."
466.0,493.0,Interviewer,"Oh, thank you. I have some background noise. So I've been muting myself. So it sounds like it's impacted a lot of parts of your life. I'm curious how it's been to feel like you've lost faith in doctors. How has that felt to you?"
493.0,495.0,Subject,How has it what?
495.0,500.0,Interviewer,How does that feel? How does it make you feel to kind of have lost this faith?
500.0,609.0,Subject,"I mean, it's horrible because I kind of noticed I'm turning into a hypochondriac because I go to the doctor to feel better, and if they're not telling me a reason for my pain, I'm going to go look online, especially if I feel like I'm dying. And then that's not going to help me because they're going to confirm that, but I just want answers. And I guess, some of them have been really trying to help. Maybe it's the whole system, where instead of it being looking at your whole body, they just focus on one specific thing. So they're sending me to all these specialists. And then I'm looking into getting a functional medicine doctor, just because, yeah, it doesn't seem to be working any other way, and honestly, I just have found some good doctors, but the doctor who did the procedure was horrible. I even got a patient advocate because I wanted to see him directly. I never got to see him after the procedure. He wouldn't see me, even after she talked to him. She emailed him. She talked to everybody, his superiors, and nothing. She's like, ""This is the first time this has ever happened."" Yeah. I don't know why he won't see me. It's just really weird."
609.0,615.0,Interviewer,That is so weird and unkind. It's just [inaudible].
615.0,663.0,Subject,"Yeah. I guess it's just the treatment, how they treat you. I had another doctor who also was my primary care doctor, which I called them one time after hours and I was really, really scared, and I was in so much pain I thought I was dying. And I told him that, and he's like, ""Why are you calling me after hours?"" And I just was so-- I took that so hard because I would think, like, ""You wouldn't say that after I told you I have so much pain and I need your help. What should I do?"" It was weird. It's not the response that I was expecting, I guess."
663.0,677.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Of course. From your care provider. So would you mind telling me a little bit more about [inaudible] functional medicine? What kind of drew you to that? What is it, actually?"
677.0,775.0,Subject,"Yeah. Sure. I mean, just googling and watching YouTube videos. I really like looking up my symptoms, and I've been on Facebook groups and all-- sorry. I stumbled onto this Dr. Hyman or something on YouTube, and it just talks about nutrition and how everything impacts your health, and how if there's something wrong with you, if you have deficiency of something, if you have inflammation, if you have something like that it could be causing these chronic issues. So it looks at your whole lifestyle, I guess, to determine what could be wrong, not necessarily just focusing on one thing. Yeah. So your diet can be causing you pain. Yeah. So it's a more balanced holistic look to your symptoms and your disease, and they also use Eastern medicine. And yeah, a lot of people that have seen these doctors have had good results, especially with conditions that are not found out through the normal specialists and everything. Yeah."
775.0,782.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I'm glad you stumbled upon that resource. And so have you started yet?
782.0,789.0,Subject,No. I haven't. I have an appointment coming up. Yeah.
789.0,800.0,Interviewer,Okay. And you said at the beginning of the call you're starting to feel a bit more hopeful. And so what do you think is inspiring that hope?
800.0,849.0,Subject,"I just see, maybe, we have a vaccine. Maybe things will get less crazy pandemic-wise, and that could also affect me in feeling more normal mentally, I guess. Less stressed. I think I really-- in the background I have this sense of, ""Oh, everything is crazy right now."" Just the pandemic and how it affects me mentally. So at least when that settles, I won't have to worry about that, and I can focus on my health. So yeah."
849.0,860.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And do you think the pandemic has affected the way you think about a lot of things?
860.0,895.0,Subject,"Not really. I mean, just, I guess, I didn't have a good view of the government before this started, and they didn't obviously perform. They lived up to that, so. And everything else, I've just dealt with it. Yeah."
895.0,924.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's true. This has not been well handled for the country at large. And so as we move out of this kind of phase with the vaccine and a new kind of-- a new president, a new administration, what do you kind of-- what do you see in the near future?"
924.0,975.0,Subject,"I mean, hopefully, things will improve. I don't expect a huge change, just because-- we'll see. I mean, I don't know. I think it's going to be an improvement regardless just because we were so low on the rock bottom with Trump, but yeah, I think, hopefully, things will get better. I have a good feeling. Yeah. I don't want to get my hopes up, but I think they're going to improve the virus just because we have the vaccine. And yeah."
975.0,987.0,Interviewer,And so what are some of the things that you are looking forward to doing or experiencing with the vaccine moving forward?
987.0,989.0,Subject,Do I mind if I take a drink of water?
989.0,994.0,Interviewer,Of course. Of course. Please do.
994.0,1010.0,Subject,"I want to travel. I really want to visit my family, my friends, not wear masks, hug people, everything. Yeah."
1010.0,1016.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So is your family far? You said you might have to travel to them.
1016.0,1031.0,Subject,"Yeah. So they live in Columbia. I have family in Miami also and wasn't able to go and spend time with them during Christmas, which I usually do. So yeah, I want to visit them."
1031.0,1038.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Of course. What was it like to have Christmas apart?
1038.0,1070.0,Subject,"It sucked. I mean, yeah, my dad had to stay there. My mom was here, and that was good, but it was just really weird. I mean, it was fine just because I know that it's better to just be apart, but hopefully, next year we'll get to meet again and do it, but double. Yeah."
1070.0,1087.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Exactly. It'll be double the celebration. Yeah. But you mentioned that you had kind of a good support system going through all of this. What has that support system been?
1087.0,1132.75,Subject,"So my mom actually came here from Columbia. She wanted to just be here with me to go to all of the doctor's appointments, which really, really helped because she kind of calms me down. So I have been feeling weird about taking all of this medication because I usually am not a medication taker, and I've been trying out a bunch of stuff and I had taken one which made me super nauseous and all of these other things. So having her here while I'm doing that has been a huge help. And she comes with me to the doctors. And yeah."
1132.75,1133.0,Interviewer,That's great.
1133.0,1134.0,Subject,It's really good.
1134.0,1142.0,Interviewer,I'm so glad. Yeah. It makes a really big difference. And is she still here?
1142.0,1147.0,Subject,Yeah. She's here until Sunday. Yeah.
1147.0,1159.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And so when she goes back, I assume, to Columbia, how are you feeling about that?"
1159.0,1200.0,Subject,"I feel okay. I mean, I have a handle on what's happening to my health. I guess I'm resigned to just having to deal with this for a while until I can know what the doctors say. And I had a test recently which, hopefully, will show what's wrong. And she's coming back in April. So I'm not too worried. Yeah. And I have my sister here. So yeah."
1200.0,1206.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's good. Okay. Good. Is your sister-- are you close?"
1206.0,1218.0,Subject,"Oh, so-so. Not really, but yeah. Yeah. We're there for each other."
1218.0,1245.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And yeah, I can understand that. So as you kind of continue to feel like this, do you have kind of hopes and plans for what you're going to be able to do when you kind of stop having these symptoms and these kind of health difficulties?"
1245.0,1283.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I recently got my violin out of storage. I play the violin, and I really want to get back to playing, but it hurts because it's on my left side, and holding it hurts. So I want to do that. I definitely have to practice. I want to be in an orchestra again. It's a big goal of mine. And also, just take dance classes and go to the gym more. Yeah."
1283.0,1295.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It will be so nice when large public dance classes are kind of back in session. Is dancing something that you've done in the past?
1295.0,1360.0,Subject,"No, but it's something that I discovered, I guess, that I wanted to do. Before I got sick, I kind of was thinking about doing some classes by myself on YouTube and looking into that. And I guess, from your earlier question, what has changed, I realize there's a lot of things that I want to do, which I shouldn't put off anymore. Which is play violin, take dance classes. And I realize that I'm more outgoing than I thought because I can't wait to be around people again, and I always thought I'm more of an introvert. So I realize that that's not necessarily the case."
1360.0,1378.0,Interviewer,"Right. Yeah. I guess you can kind of like being alone, but still need people to recharge and be happy. Definitely. And so that's really exciting. What do you think draws you to music and dance? What do you think inspires you to do those?"
1378.0,1450.0,Subject,"I don't know. I get lost in it just playing. Sometimes I'll be playing a song, and just thinking about how beautiful it sounds or how the composer does these kinds of things, I like to lose myself in that. I guess it's kind of cool. I just think about how they were able to put it together. I don't know if that makes sense, but I also like playing with people. I love being in an orchestra and feeding off of everybody's energy and playing together. So I really like that. And dance, it's such an expression thing for me. I don't know. I love music and I love-- yeah. I don't know. And so it's--"
1450.0,1451.0,Interviewer,Yeah. [crosstalk]. Yeah.
1451.0,1458.0,Subject,"Yeah. I feel free, yeah, when I do it."
1458.0,1503.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. These things can be an expression of how much you like music if you can kind of move with it. Yeah. Okay. So it sounds like we have a lot of things to be excited about. And I'm kind of curious how things feel different than before. I understand the pandemic. So much was different than before, but I'm wondering a little bit more about feeling some of the things that you've gone through. How do you think it's changed your life if it has?"
1503.0,1565.0,Subject,"Well, it's hard to say. I mean, I kind of have-- I kind of check in with myself how I'm feeling, and I think right now, I'm just resigned and trying to just keep myself hopeful that I'll find a solution to my health issues. It's been hard to keep that mindset, but I'm just kind of not thinking about it and just going from doing appointments and hoping for the best. Yeah. I've had things like this happen before where I broke my ankle, and it took a while to heal. So yeah."
1565.0,1590.0,Interviewer,"Right. And I guess eventually it did, and you kind of got to go back to normal. Okay. And then so what have you-- so you said you're kind of working at home, and you stopped working in kind of that hybrid fashion. What brought that about?"
1590.0,1614.0,Subject,"Just having to take public transportation, and just my illness, I guess. I can't really be comfortable in a chair for six hours straight anymore. Which, yeah, I'm trying to resolve soon."
1614.0,1619.0,Interviewer,Yeah. God. It must be so hard. I'm sorry.
1619.0,1621.0,Subject,It's okay.
1621.0,1625.0,Interviewer,And so what do you do for work?
1625.0,1627.0,Subject,I work in IT.
1627.0,1642.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And so it kind of can be done remotely, which is great. What brought you to IT?"
1642.0,1713.0,Subject,"So I mean, there's two aspects of it. So some of it is not remotely, but technically, our office is closed. So nobody's going in. If they have a computer problem where we have to fix a part or change something, they will send that in to us, or they'll get Dell or something to repair for them. And then there's the software side, which is more helping online and things like that, but I like both. I like the hands-on part. I was part of an IT bootcamp, which is where I got into it. And I've always been interested in technology, but never had a chance to work with it. So when I did, I really liked it. Yeah."
1713.0,1722.0,Interviewer,That's great. And so is this something that you think you'll continue to do moving forward?
1722.0,1765.0,Subject,"Yeah. Definitely. It's something that I see-- it's a really good skill to have, just because before I knew how to fix something, but now I know how to google it. I'm not scared to open a computer. Before, I was terrified. I think it's important to learn a little bit because it's just the technology-- I see just technology is so a part of our lives, and it's going to become more apparent. And yeah."
1765.0,1792.0,Interviewer,Absolutely. It's definitely the way of the future. There is no [leaving it?]. And so that's great that you kind of have a career in front of you. What do you see yourself kind of doing with this in the next few years? What is kind of the long-term plan?
1792.0,1827.0,Subject,"Yeah. I want to do freelance IT work, and then just see how to get into cyber security, which is not what I do right now, but something that I find more interesting. And I want to open my own consulting IT business. Yeah."
