1.0,10.0,Interviewer,Okay. So the first question that I will ask you is how have things been going for you lately?
10.0,19.0,Subject,They’re all right. I'm sorry. I don't really know what to share.
19.0,24.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, so what's been going all right?"
24.0,133.0,Subject,"I've kind of just been able to sleep, I guess, and not really have such depressing emotions. Lately, I have been waking up though at like 3:00 in the morning, which I'm hoping will fix tonight. Other than that, things have been fine with family. I've been able to communicate with them and not really argue. I'm trying to spend time with friends, but also not too much since I'm kind of easily drained. I know they care for me, but I'm also trying not to bring them down out of fear that I have of them abandoning me or not being able to handle my baggage. I have no partner, no drug addiction, no alcohol addiction. I'm kind of just talking in general now. Yeah. And I don't really know about my family too well, [like aside?] my parents and a few grandparents."
133.0,142.0,Interviewer,"Would you say that you're close with your kind of nuclear family, like your grandparents and your parents?"
142.0,183.0,Subject,"I never met any of my biological-- or sorry, I mean my biological grandfathers. I only knew one, and his name was Tommy. But we weren't related by blood, only through marriage. I know my grandma my mom's side and my grandma my dad's side, but I'm more closer to the one on my dad's side."
183.0,197.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And you said that you've been kind of able to avoid kind of confrontations with them. How is that different from maybe before?
197.0,233.0,Subject,"Usually, it was like a lot of yelling. Kind of like my mother would get stressed out about work, and kind of like take it out on us by finding things to yell at us about. And by us, I mean me and my little brother."
233.0,237.0,Interviewer,What was that like?
237.0,294.0,Subject,"I don't know. I've done what I could to just survive, say like, ""It's going to be a few more years and you're moving out,"" or whatever. It was worse in the past, but I was able to argue enough and talk with my mother to understand what she-- for it to get better, but it's still there sometimes. And also, I'm not putting all the blame on her. I know she's doing her best, especially since none of my brothers' fathers or even my own were really great. And yeah."
294.0,314.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you said you have multiple brothers and that sometimes your mom would take things out on you and your brothers. What is your relationship like with them?
314.0,381.0,Subject,"My older brother is seven years older than me, so he's turning 30-- or maybe he is 30. I'm not really too sure. Regardless, I don't really talk to him, not since he got drunk one night and cheated on his wife and then proceeded to curse me out when I wouldn't shit-talk our mother. As for my younger brother, he's 10 years old, so he's 13 years younger than me. Him and I get along, but it’s also hard to spend time with him sometimes because it feels like I'm babysitting. But yeah, I do my best to not treat my little brother like my older brother treated me. And yeah."
381.0,385.0,Interviewer,That sounds great.
385.0,399.0,Subject,"I did have a stepbrother too, but he committed suicide four years ago."
399.0,403.0,Interviewer,What was that like for you to experience?
403.0,422.0,Subject,I don't think there are really words to describe it. I just feel very empty.
422.0,428.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What was your relationship with him like before he passed?
428.0,473.0,Subject,"We always got along. We'd play video games together all the time, share memes. We only ever got into two arguments. One, around the time when we first met, he threw a basketball at me. I snapped at him and I said, ""Don't do that again. I don't like it,"" my voiced changed and everything, and he understood that I didn’t like that. And the other time was when we both wanted to play on a game, but we were sharing account, from different states. This was when he was visiting family. And yeah."
473.0,474.0,Interviewer,I'm so sorry that--
474.0,527.0,Subject,"[crosstalk]. We never fought. Feels like a part of me is missing, because I felt like I could always go and just be around him."
527.0,537.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Is there anybody in your life who you feel like you can be around in the same way?
537.0,565.0,Subject,"Kind of. I only have really two physical friends. All the other friends are online. Which I've made great online friends, even cried in front of them a few times, which I don't normally do. And yeah."
565.0,575.0,Interviewer,What do you think allowed you to kind of open up and be vulnerable like that with your online friends?
575.0,601.0,Subject,"I had asked that they had a moment, and I shared some of the stuff I was going through at the time. And they stuck around after. They actually listened and cared and, I don't know, they've just been different than other people."
601.0,625.0,Interviewer,"That's great. And so you mentioned before and just now a little bit too that your friends stuck around, and that's something that kind of weighs on you a little bit whether they will stick around. I'm curious, what do you think makes you feel like maybe people won't?"
625.0,805.0,Subject,"It's because of something that happened in high school. I was dating a girl. I actually fell in love with her. But around the time that it was like 11 months into the relationship, she had started avoiding me for a whole month, wouldn't talk to me, would lie to me about stuff, saying the Facebook Messenger wasn't working or whatever, in which I later find out that she's been-- this is what she told me, is that she's been cheating on me with another person, an adult who was married and a cop. So that kind of messed with me. I then told my closest friends at the time what had happened. It's a small school, so everyone found out eventually and it got back to her, the truth-- or for her, truth that she told in which she then proceeded to tell everyone that I had raped her after that. Which, of course, when I found this out, I told my parents immediately and we talked to the guidance counselor. The school guidance counselor talked to everyone involved with the rumor. And yeah, they eventually brought the girl who made up the rumor, and she said that she never heard of any rumor like that.  But that's actually why I'm friends with two people from high school, one of which was the-- it was how I found out about this rumor. He came and asked me the side of my story before taking-- and he even stayed neutral until the truth came out that my ex was lying about it all. And because of that, I've always trusted him. But he's also not super emotional. So the way we've managed to stay in contact over the years is by taking each other out to dinner and whatnot, try new foods. And yeah. That's why I don't really tell people much about me anymore. "
805.0,855.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that sounds like a really harrowing experience, actually. I'm sorry. Violation like that, of trust, is really upsetting. I am glad that you had some kind of neutral parties in this scenario and that the truth did come to light. So I understand that you have kind of two friends from high school that you keep in touch with you said. And I'm curious what you think-- or how you think your relationships kind of differ between kind of in-person friends from high school and your more like online friends."
855.0,892.0,Subject,"In person, I feel like I more have to put up a face to show everyone that I'm fine, I'm happy, whatever than doing okay; and online, I can just be myself and talk with people and actually enjoy stuff without it being face to face. Which is why I'm looking down at the screen because it's easier for me to talk about this stuff that way."
892.0,894.0,Interviewer,Absolutely.
894.0,897.0,Subject,And yeah.
897.0,919.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. And yeah, so what do you think makes you feel like putting up this-- why do you think it is more effort to do the in person-- kind of mustering that kind of face?"
919.0,949.0,Subject,"I don't know. I've noticed that people tend to look up to me, especially when I came to leading a community service club in high school. There wasn't really any person to lead the club, and I kind of just stepped up."
949.0,952.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, what was that experience like?"
952.0,1019.0,Subject,"I remember this one thing my friend had said when I asked him how does he lead his club, and he said, ""The truth is we don't know how to lead a club. We just pretend like we do, and people follow."" And with that, I was able to lead the community service club for two years, in which we had baked sales to fund our projects; our projects being making food and goody bags for homeless people and handing them out on the street. We cleaned up parks, as well as we bought toys for an orphanage. And we even helped raise money for a fellow student's funeral."
1019.0,1028.0,Interviewer,"Wow. That must have been an early, untimely passing."
1028.0,1032.0,Subject,Yeah.
1032.0,1034.0,Interviewer,Was it someone you were close to?
1034.0,1134.0,Subject,"He was a member of the club. He apparently also knew me and thought I was funny. Because the school, every year, has to go through this same project of creating a commercial for what their project is about. And I guess they used the commercial I helped make and showed it to future students, so other people liked, I guess-- or he liked it. And yeah. So whenever I saw him in the hallway, we'd always smile at each other. And then one day, he apparently left his home and committed suicide by jumping in the river. I spoke at his funeral, didn’t really know what to say other than I wish he was still here, that he would've came and talked. But overall, he had a good heart and stuff. I knew he was a good kid. Yeah."
1134.0,1140.0,Interviewer,What helped you know that he was a good kid?
1140.0,1147.0,Subject,"Gut feeling, I guess."
1147.0,1151.0,Interviewer,Do you follow your gut a lot?
1151.0,1157.0,Subject,"Sometimes. Other times, it gets me in trouble."
1157.0,1165.0,Interviewer,What was the time when you think it got you in trouble?
1165.0,1189.0,Subject,Usually when I try to date someone. It's usually a bad time. I’ll usually make myself more vulnerable and end up getting hurt.
1189.0,1213.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That can definitely happen with dating. And yeah, so you said you didn’t have a partner. Who do you think you normally spend kind of the most quality time with?"
1213.0,1239.0,Subject,"Mostly with my online friends, I guess, which I have-- there's like three, four different groups, two of which I'm close with, and the other two I just occasionally pop in and just hang out and call."
1239.0,1246.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And how did you kind of become so close with two of those groups?
1246.0,1266.0,Subject,"I spent time with them, played a lot of video games, talked about stuff. And yeah. I guess it just happened over time."
1266.0,1281.0,Interviewer,That's great. Okay. Tell me a little bit about what you-- are you in school? Are you working?
1281.0,1355.75,Subject,"No. I'm not in school. Because when my brother committed suicide, I was in finals week. His body was technically still alive. So I wasn't able to go see it before they pulled the plug because of finals. And I kind of just thought that it was very shitty that I couldn't go see my dying brother because of a few sheets of paper. So I took a break, in which I haven't really found a reason to go back. As for work, I did work seven months in fresh retail at Zara, but I left because I felt like the company didn’t give a shit about me. I'm not currently working either because I had surgery for-- I had a pilonidal cyst on the top of my ass crack, which I think did get infected, so I had to get a surgery to get it removed. And--"
1355.75,1356.0,Interviewer,"Oh, man. I'm sorry."
1356.0,1384.0,Subject,"Yeah. A plastic surgeon then removed some of my butt fat and skin over, gave me like a Harry Potter scar to help the healing. Otherwise, it'll take it a year rather than two, three months, which I got that surgery early December."
1384.0,1386.0,Interviewer,Wow. So that's pretty recent.
1386.0,1390.0,Subject,Yes.
1390.0,1393.0,Interviewer,Do you still feel pain or anything?
1393.0,1448.0,Subject,"A little bit, because I didn’t do a good job massaging the scar with the Aquaphor. So I still have a portion of it that's still hard and big, mainly because I didn’t realize it was there, but I do now. So I'm in the process of massaging that scar and hoping it goes down because if it doesn't, then I have to get injected with steroids. Yeah. [laughter] It's probably too much information, but now I got more hair growing there, which is what caused it in the first place. So I just want to get it healed so I could get laser hair removal under my insurance, and I don't have to worry about this ever again. [laughter]"
1448.0,1451.0,Interviewer,"Well, it's great that insurance might cover that."
1451.0,1454.0,Subject,"Yeah, because it's not-- for medical reason."
1454.0,1457.0,Interviewer,Right. Oops. Yeah. So I guess there's a silver lining. [laughter]
1457.0,1459.0,Subject,Yes.
1459.0,1474.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So that sounds like it would definitely kind of halt life a little bit. So during kind of your recovery period, have you been mostly at home?"
1474.0,1543.0,Subject,"Yes. So for the first week, I wasn't allowed to sit down or lay on my back, which turned into a whole month of me not being able to do that. But for the first week, it was the worst because I was not able to even-- I couldn't even sit down to poop, which it was like-- really sucked. And it sucked even more because my elderly neighbor who I help out from time to time, she passed away during that first week, which is also the same week that my brother had cheated on his wife and picked fights with me, calling my mental health like made up and shit. Hmm? I thought you're asking a question."
1543.0,1547.0,Interviewer,No. I'm sorry. I was just reacting. That's quite a week.
1547.0,1660.0,Subject,"Yeah. We also had a fire in the building not too long before that, which there was a bunch of water damage which we're still kind of recovering from. At least the building is. A lot of people moved out after that. I think it's [inaudible] like 5 apartments are rented, maybe 6, and there's still 15 more that can be rented. And yeah. I think after that month of not being able to move is when I got really depressed and even suicidal, in which I started-- I did have an online therapist which after I told her about me seeing things as both a child and even currently, she recommended I talk to a psychologist and get a mental health exam. And one thing led to another, so now I speak to Dr. Lester as my therapist, and he introduced me to you guys. In which I'm also on Lexapro I think it’s what it's called, antidepressant of 15 milliliters every day every morning. And I still have a few butt doctor appointments, as well as I got a schedule-- an appointment for my wisdom teeth to be removed, as well as two extra teeth."
1660.0,1678.0,Interviewer,"Oh, man. I've been avoiding my wisdom teeth removal for a long time. [laughter] So you mentioned that it was kind of-- that that month at home was pretty hard."
1678.0,1687.0,Subject,Yeah. It was also the anniversary of my brother's death that same month of December. So yeah.
1687.0,1707.0,Interviewer,"Wow. Yeah, that sounds like a really hard couple of weeks. Okay, so kind of starting in the new year, were you able to do-- how has it kind of evolved since December?"
1707.0,1772.0,Subject,"I started to walk a bit more. I was able to sit, but only for a max of like 5, 10 minutes. I had to do that for like three weeks, in which later on, I was able to actually fully sit down, which was nice. All I had to do was just keep massaging my scarring. Time kind of went by fast. Usually, I kind of just don't remember certain days. Today, I thought it was Tuesday, to be honest with you. I forgot where I was going, sorry."
1772.0,1837.0,Interviewer,"Okay. We've been talking a little bit about how things have evolved since December, which seemed to be like a really difficult time period. And yeah, I'm curious how you think being so stuck kind of physically affected your mental health. You mean physically?"
1837.0,1855.0,Subject,"Yeah. Sometimes mentally, but yeah. I'm sorry. I'm doing my best to describe things."
1855.0,1860.0,Interviewer,It's okay. Take your time.
1860.0,1896.0,Subject,"It's kind of hard to-- because sometimes things can seem like they're getting better, but also makes me wonder like, ""Am I just putting on a face for myself this time to make myself think-- to show improvement that I'm getting better? Or am I actually getting better?"""
1896.0,1903.0,Interviewer,Interesting. That was--
1903.0,1904.0,Subject,Okay.
1904.0,1905.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, go ahead. [laughter]"
1905.0,1922.0,Subject,"I was going to say my online therapist, before Dr. Lester, she described some of my thinking as like a rocking chair, a lot of paradoxes type thing."
1922.0,1929.0,Interviewer,"Interesting. I don't associate with rocking chair as paradoxes, but can you give me an example?"
1929.0,1950.0,Subject,"Kind of just like on the fence, like there is no real answer, just the choice with consequences. And then there's me stuck in between."
1950.0,1975.0,Interviewer,"Interesting. Really interesting analogy. Do you feel like that is true in a lot of aspects of your life, or is it specifically kind of regarding your mental health?"
1975.0,2007.0,Subject,"I don't know. Because I want to be able to make a choice and just be sure of what I choose. But at the same time, I'm so on the fence about a lot of things, about whether something is the right choice or not. And then sometimes I just-- again, I follow my gut and hope that's the right one."
