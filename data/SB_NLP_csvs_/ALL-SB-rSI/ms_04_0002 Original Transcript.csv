0.0,17.0,Interviewer,And mostly for you to give us sort of like a window into what it's like to be you. So maybe you could start by saying a little bit about how things have been going lately. How was your summer? How have you been?
17.0,21.0,Subject,"Sure. You asked me a lot of question, [inaudible] just give me a little [crosstalk]."
21.0,23.0,Interviewer,Sure.
23.0,103.0,Subject,"So I was in New Haven for the summer. I'm 21, so I've been through the yeshiva system, which is strictly Judaic at this point. It was the first three years of-- I guess from 9th to 11th, and I'm an older student. And for the summer, I actually wanted to help, like more of a counseloring with the younger guys, got a little more relaxed schedule, so I was involved in the summer program. I learned with some of them, arranged some programs. That was my summer. I guess five, six weeks. That was exciting. Something specific I did was I was involved in making an extra wake-- doing something before, an extra learning session before the day started. Say day started at 8:15, so 7:45 to 8:15, I would arrange something for them per day or fun ways for-- I guess there'd be a lot of food as incentive for the guys to get up. And for like an hour, [inaudible] whatever they were learning. I would orally give a little lecture for people who didn't want to learn by themselves."
103.0,104.0,Interviewer,Wow.
104.0,130.75,Subject,"Yeah. [inaudible] guys one-on-one throughout the day, morning, late morning, afternoon, evening. I was nice. Anything exciting. They did a trip once a week, I guess all assortments. One time, one week, we went paintball shooting, one week went kayaking, one week went ropes coursing."
130.75,131.0,Interviewer,Wow.
131.0,143.0,Subject,"One week, we went to play bowling. All these kind of stuff. That was it. That was so far my summer. Summer's not over, so still some stuff to do."
143.0,146.0,Interviewer,Wow. So you had a lot of fun stuff this summer.
146.0,199.0,Subject,"So yeah. Personally, I'm more than happy to skip out of some things, especially working on [inaudible] throughout the summer. Actually stayed-- usually for the summer, I would go to, say, a camp to be the counselor or something along those lines or just learn myself, but this summer, I want-- I've been meaning to come to New Haven. I live in New Haven, so I really haven't been home for a while. This was actually me just wanting to stay home for two months because-- I guess refresh and work out next year. So I saw the best place would be if I would stay home. Yeah. So that's the reason I chose New Haven, but I guess in the past, I've been to Manchester for a summer, usually the Catskills, either as a camper or as a counselor, Montreal. All over [inaudible]."
199.0,201.0,Interviewer,So you've done a lot of these camps [crosstalk]?
201.0,210.0,Subject,"So yeah, camp is like-- I guess that's a basic thing. What would you do when you were a kid in the summer?"
210.0,212.0,Interviewer,Thanks for asking. I think I'd like to keep the focus on you if that's okay.
212.0,213.0,Subject,"Oh, sure. Sure."
213.0,221.0,Interviewer,So it sounds like you've had some wonderful summers. How would you say this summer was compared to your other summers?
221.0,238.0,Subject,"Compared to other summers-- I guess they get more relaxing as time goes on. The first summer was probably the most stressful [inaudible] a counselor. As it went on, I guess it got less and less-- more easy, more enjoyable [crosstalk]."
238.0,240.0,Interviewer,So being a counselor is stressful in general?
240.0,258.0,Subject,"The beginning especially was. I guess the expectations were probably different. I changed my expectations of what I was looking to get from the summer, how my relationship should be with the campers, so that changed. Am I speaking loud enough for your recorder?"
258.0,262.0,Interviewer,You're doing great. So what is it like in general being a counselor at one of these camps?
262.0,302.0,Subject,"Beginning the first time I was a counselor, I guess my expectations were whatever-- certain expectations, I guess, that were given to me, I guess, from the head counselors or from speaking to other people who were counselors from different places. There were very strict expectations about you getting kids to do certain things. By meal times, they have to eat. By going to bed, they have to go to sleep at a certain time. Not talking during prayers. Sports. Having to participate."
302.0,303.0,Interviewer,So you had to be a disciplinarian?
303.0,312.75,Subject,"Exactly. So in the beginning, that's how it was. It was the closest I've ever experienced to the most horrendous-- it was pretty horrendous."
312.75,313.0,Interviewer,Really?
313.0,386.0,Subject,"Yeah. It was the first very stressful thing I've done. In fact, that was very stressful, that time before, and that actual summer was a very stressful time. And then the product at the end, I was miserable. I don't think the kids really enjoyed it so much. I didn't really think that was-- people could tell me that my job was to discipline, but yeah, I don't think it was really what I wanted, so next time [inaudible] the summer, I just did more of my own-- set my own goals of what I thought I was supposed to be doing. And they could tell me, ""This is what you have to be doing,"" but at the end of the day, I'm supposed to be the counselor. I'm supposed to give them a fun time, so I changed it up a bit as times went on. Manchester English kids are much different. That was much easier. They were younger, it was shorter, but in general, it was much, much easier, just their mindset. People in England are much more obedient, if that's a good word to use. Plus the first summer, I guess the group of kids that I'd been dealing with-- saw more chutzpah going around. Do you know what the word chutzpah means [laughter]?"
386.0,387.0,Interviewer,I think so.
387.0,434.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's a lot more-- what's a good word-- maybe a little bit of naiveness, rudeness, a blend in between, somewhere between that. But it's good. I think it's good. I think the chutzpah kids-- a lot of Brooklyn kids [inaudible] the first summer I was in the Catskills, and that was good. I think people, they should have more of that mindset, not being bossed around by other people. It allows people to succeed because it's nice and all to listen and to work well with other people, but in the end of the day, especially as a kid, I think you should be able to have that, ""I want this,"" to be able to express yourself very clearly. I think that was good, but not as a counselor. I didn't enjoy it, obviously [laughter]. Yeah."
434.0,435.0,Interviewer,Why was that?
435.0,447.0,Subject,"Obviously because-- especially as being the disciplinarian, it's very tough. If you're wanting them to listen, and they don't want to listen, it's very tough. And if they feel very comfortable saying no, it's very hard. Yeah. So that was--"
447.0,450.0,Interviewer,How did you deal with that? Was that very frustrating?
450.0,451.0,Subject,The first summer?
451.0,452.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
452.0,542.0,Subject,"So there was also this idea, I wanted it-- it was my first summer, I wanted to be the best counselor. I wanted to do everything myself, so I wanted to handle the situation. So that was very tough. There was a lot of trying to create new options, meaning-- let's say if you're trying to get a kid to do something, eat something, instead of telling them, ""You have to eat. Tell me if you could either eat cereal right now or a sandwich, what do you want?"" That was one way, not that it worked. It usually doesn't work. They're like, ""You know, I'll choose a third option, which is no [laughter]."" Yeah. A lot like that. Try to find what you have. What do you have as a counselor to use as a consequence? A lot of talking. I really wouldn't punish them, meaning any punishment would really be me talking to them, meaning if you misbehave now, we're going to have to talk about it later [by?] sports. Not that I'm punishing them making them miss sports, but automatically, if you're talking to me, you're not playing sports, so that's what's happened. I [inaudible] find that either good because that just makes you the punisher. That wasn't good. [Similar?] things along those lines. It's not so hard to think of ideas. The most effective way really is just to kind of avoid the whole idea of discipline, try to get a good system going. ""If you're doing this, you get rewarded,"" and then you pick out the negative disciplinary things later and deal with them versus letting things-- just in the beginning of the summer turn into a whole disciplinarian."
542.0,552.0,Interviewer,"So your style as a counselor, you realized, was to do less disciplinary stuff and focus more on setting up rewards systems and figuring out ways to reward them?"
552.0,564.0,Subject,Yeah. I think it's also just on personality. I'm sure some of the guys are much better at telling people what to do. I don't feel like that's my strongest point.
564.0,572.0,Interviewer,That sounds like an interesting journey that you went through figuring out how to be a good counselor.
572.0,646.75,Subject,"Yeah. Definitely. It's third summer. Third summer was different. I was more of learning. As a counselor, you're not really learning with them at all, you're just dealing with them, right, whatever activity, more activities. Third summer, I was in-- again, I was in the same camp as I was in the first summer and actually the same group of kids except it was probably three years later, and it was a special division. When they get older, it's like all the divisions are by themselves. And we had a very special-- everyone liked it. Everyone was proud to be there because it had a very good name, that division, from all the camps around the world, so that was good. They were happy to be there. That's one thing that I guess [inaudible] have. But I was more of the learning, so the disciplinary has to be much more because you can't just be friendly with them. If you actually want to learn anything, you have to find a way to keep kids quiet. Beginning [inaudible] first, I had some serious issue-- meaning I had kids with serious issues in the beginning. I only found out later these issues that kids had, so one kid's father committed suicide."
646.75,647.0,Interviewer,Wow.
647.0,662.75,Subject,"So yeah, he was a very good kid, and that really shook him up. Yeah, but I didn't know about that about that kid until in the middle summer. At a certain point, someone decided to tell me that. A counselor decided to tell me that."
662.75,663.0,Interviewer,Wow.
663.0,677.0,Subject,"Yeah. Another kid also had an issue, but in general, the beginning was very more disciplinary. But again, I was really relaxed. I wasn't really going for the discipline. As I already said, we just don't like doing that."
677.0,683.0,Interviewer,What was it like to be the counselor for that kid who had had that experience with his dad?
683.0,743.0,Subject,"It was hard. It was hard to find good moments. There was a lot of-- I mean, he himself was a very quiet kid. He would hang out with one kid for a very long-- meaning there was one kid he would hang out with. He was very quiet almost. Very immature in a certain sense than this other kid. Nothing special. Obviously, just try to talk to him, try to be friendly with him outside learning class. Yeah. I wouldn't say it was a learning experience because I really don't feel like so much happened between us. I don't know. Yeah."
743.0,750.0,Interviewer,"So this past summer, you were a counselor as well?"
750.0,752.0,Subject,This past summer? This summer right now?
752.0,753.0,Interviewer,"This current summer, yeah."
753.0,769.0,Subject,"Not really a counselor, no. This is [inaudible] older kids, and they're actually in school. This is just regular school for them. It's more of a relaxed schedule. I wouldn't really say-- I'm not a counselor. I'm not over [inaudible]. I let them [inaudible]. They could learn if they want. They don't have to."
769.0,778.0,Interviewer,"So how do you like this summer? Better, or how would it compare to the other summers you've had with this style of what you've been doing?"
778.0,804.0,Subject,"The beginning was much more relaxed. I didn't really go there as a group. Usually, I would go somewhere as a group, like a group of people. It wasn't really like that. I knew the other people were there. I knew them, and they were my friends, some of them. Again, like I said, I went to New Haven for a summer, so in my mind, I was just going there to have a more relaxed summer."
804.0,807.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Has it been a relaxed summer?
807.0,847.0,Subject,"In the beginning was. I was struggling with a choice of where to go next year, so that was a little tough, meaning very taking your mind off the present moment through my day. I guess a couple-- probably last week at this time, want to say, yeah, I decided where I was going to go. I can't say it wasn't so relieving, but definitely took away that whole bouncing back and forth and I guess the sensation that you should be doing something that you're not doing, like making a decision or for making more options for yourself that you're not doing."
847.0,850.0,Interviewer,So you had that feeling for most of the summer you mean?
850.0,860.0,Subject,Yeah. I guess that's-- also the end of the last year [inaudible]. It's very long and drawn out.
860.0,864.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. What was that like, so this [inaudible]?"
864.0,865.0,Subject,Decision-making?
865.0,868.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, decision-making, this uncertain time that ended last week."
868.0,1088.0,Subject,"Very, I guess, stressful. Not able to focus. Takes a lot of-- definitely affects the creative part of your [inaudible]. That was for sure. Very focused on [one?] and was clenched on one thing. Not really able to just relax and be carefree because especially almost-- it was since I wanted to take care of it at a certain point, in my mind, it was almost like the deadline kept on coming up and up again. If I pushed it off, it still was a deadline I just pushed off for a couple days. It wasn't like I have a month to work it out so I could relax for two weeks and two weeks work on it [laughter]. Yeah. [inaudible] I mean. I thought about it a lot. I did create more options, nothing I was really satisfied with. There were certain things that I thought I wanted that I really wasn't. In the beginning, I was looking for-- two options are looking for-- I was looking for a learning partner for next year. I'd be learning with him five hours a day every day, I'd say Sunday to Thursday. Friday and Saturday maybe if it was necessary so I had some extra hours. Would be going through part of codex of law and for Jewish law, Talmudic law. It's more simple. It's more straightforward. I guess I was looking, number one, for a liability. In the beginning, I felt my options were choosing one guy who's more of a reliable guy but more of a calm guy, and I was looking more for someone who was a little more energetic. On the other hand, the other person who I was thinking about was more energetic, but he wasn't as-- also a little nervous side to him, which I wasn't so excited about since I, myself [am myself?] a little more of a nervous person. I was looking for someone-- from another person, one thing I would like from it is to make more calm. So yeah, so those were two options. I didn't hear that he had the best past couple years. That was that. The places themselves also were part of the factor. This more of a calm guy, more reliable guy, it wasn't really he wanted to go to a place that wasn't part of a program but just to go to a school and we would learn together. And then we would do it on our own, though. We would have to find the person who would test us and give us the ordination. We'd have to find the lectures audio recorded. We'd have to find the exact parts that were best to learn and best to skip throughout the whole thing, and we're going to have to find those all on our own. The person that was more energetic, I would be going with him to a program much more official. Not that the people [inaudible], meaning the other people in the program were the best creating an atmosphere of learning, meaning that not necessarily were the strongest learners. But yeah, those were the two choices, so I guess it was very hard to decide exactly. Especially, I didn't feel like they were the best options, so bouncing around."
1088.0,1092.0,Interviewer,So you wish that you had a different option besides those?
1092.0,1105.0,Subject,"[inaudible] meaning-- I guess, number one, yes, but on the other hand, it's so-- I [inaudible] wish that I had another option."
1105.0,1111.0,Interviewer,So then last week you decided between the two.
1111.0,1138.0,Subject,"Yeah. I did actually at a certain point decide to go with the more energetic person. Then a week later, I told him I thought I was committed, but I don't feel committed, so I don't want to hold you back. And if you want to find another person to learn with, go for it. This past week, I decided to learn with the person who was, I guess, the more calm person, that's [inaudible] more reliable. Yeah. Hopefully it works out between us."
1138.0,1140.0,Interviewer,How do you feel about the decision now?
1140.0,1186.0,Subject,"On one hand, I feel like it's more of a-- it's a good decision, maybe the stronger decision, meaning one I'd have to-- a little harder but better in the end. It's not so colorful on the outside, but on the inside, I think it should be good. I was also-- yeah. There's so many-- I want it, and it's so very important for you to be happy where you are. On the other hand, I'm looking to grow, so the place I'm happy where I am, it's probably-- at certain points, it's not necessarily the place I'm going to grow, so that's part of that decision-making."
1186.0,1193.0,Interviewer,"And you've been feeling relieved that you got that decision behind you, you think?"
1193.0,1226.0,Subject,"Yeah. I am relieved. It's weird. I am still stressed out - I don't know why - but there is definitely the relief. There's a little more security, definitely. I guess the stress is I would like to be 100% with my decision. I'm definitely not that guy to decide something and close my eyes and just be okay with it. No matter what happens happens. Some things are okay if it's a small thing, but if I consider it a big thing, I'm not going to get over it so fast."
1226.0,1230.0,Interviewer,It's hard for you move on past the--
1230.0,1245.0,Subject,"Best decision is right before the time I have to make a decision, like the day before session starts, I'm just going to make a decision. And then once you're in it already, you're already had to kind of get over it, the thought process."
1245.0,1249.0,Interviewer,You have to kind of get over the mental thought process.
1249.0,1260.0,Subject,"So yeah. I'm saying once you're already in the program, you're doing it for real life, so you don't really care about the mental thought process. That's it."
1260.0,1267.75,Interviewer,"Yeah. So yeah, so thanks for sharing those things."
1267.75,1268.0,Subject,"Yeah, sure."
1268.0,1285.0,Interviewer,"It's a great insight into what you've been thinking about in the last few months it sounds like. So then, Menachem, what do you think about as you're looking towards the next few months?"
1285.0,1288.0,Subject,Saying after [inaudible] or [crosstalk]?
1288.0,1294.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, so now you've made this big decision. What do you think the future's going to look like now?"
1294.0,1295.0,Subject,For the next few months or just like afterwards?
1295.0,1316.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How about both or either? Whatever would make you happier to talk about.
1316.0,1395.0,Subject,"I guess for the next few months. Hoping to find a way to get back into the swing of learning because, obviously, the summer's more vacation time. Learn a lot. Yeah, that's it. Get into a pattern for that. I'm also going to be-- like I said, last year I was a mentor for younger students. This year, usually people just do getting the ordination, getting the rabbinical ordination on its own, but I'm actually going to do both next year, getting a rabbinical ordination as well as working with younger students. I'm going to have to find a time to balance that out. So I guess that's already seven-and-a-half hours of learning on the plate, so I'm going to have to work-- find a way to do that without-- I guess getting a way to do that and be comfortable and calm to do it every day without fail. Obviously, once in a while, I'll screw up, but to get that flow, I'm trying to work it out now. It's positive, meaning if it does work out, I think it'll be very nice, very good."
1395.0,1401.0,Interviewer,"So that sounds like a little bit of a source of worry for you. Is that right, you worry?"
1401.0,1422.0,Subject,"It's actually-- no, I wouldn't say it's a worry. A worry's more when there's a decision. That's a worry for me because what if I make the wrong decision? Once there's something to do, it's just how am I going to do it? I wouldn't say it's a worry really, it's more of a-- just probably more exciting. You know what to do. Having someone [inaudible] for me is the best. It's very enjoyable."
1422.0,1425.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Why is that?
1425.0,1517.0,Subject,"Probably because of the lack of having to make a decision. When I make a decision, when I think if I make the wrong decision, it's more of me. When something just happens, it happened. It's not your fault, and you have to give your best shot at it. I wouldn't say it's a stressful thing. You have a decision. Now, the only person to blame is you. It's kind of more a self-- make a decision, you're almost-- if you make the wrong decision, meaning, obviously, [inaudible], but you have to make the best of them. Let's say if you're saying this is a better decision or a worse decision, and you're scared to make the wrong decision, then you're scared, I guess, really yourself, your self-esteem. You could have done better. Now, if you're going for something, and you're trying hard and even if you mess up along the way - everyone messes up - but if you have this decision and you're calm and you have time to make it, then it's kind of all on you. If you screw up, it looks bad on you in your own eyes, so I guess that's probably where the stress comes from. Other things, you can always blame on other people, and it's, ""Oh, it's all good."" [inaudible] when it's yourself, that's horrendous. Yeah."
1517.0,1520.0,Interviewer,No one to blame but yourself if you made the decision.
1520.0,1531.0,Subject,Yeah.
1531.0,1540.0,Interviewer,"Okay, so we've got about five minutes left. What's something that I didn't think to ask you about?"
1540.0,1549.0,Subject,What foods do I like best? I love pizza and ice cream [laughter]. Next?
1549.0,1571.0,Interviewer,"So you've got this big thing starting again, seven-and-a-half hours coming up per day. I guess what do you think about it as you think-- when that starts, what's it going to be like to be balancing that do you think? Is it going to be different than life before this past summer, what you were doing, or is it going to be?"
1571.0,1612.75,Subject,"Not much different. More of on my own, meaning, I guess, much less responsible, meaning no one's going to be on top of me. That's going to be nice. It's going to be tougher, and I think I work better that way, running my own schedule. I think I should be successful and okay with it. I'm sure I'm going to mess up a few times, but then get into the swing of it, and that's going to be nice. Look forward to that. Yeah. I guess what else? You talked [inaudible] with me about relationships with other people, so relationship with peers."
1612.75,1613.0,Interviewer,"With your parents, you say?"
1613.0,1613.75,Subject,Peers.
1613.75,1614.0,Interviewer,Peers.
1614.0,1744.0,Subject,"Like friends. With peers-- I guess on one hand, when I was a kid, I was much more-- I really didn't care about other people, meaning my friends, when I dealt with them, it wasn't like, ""What's this guy thinking?"" So I was very athletic when I was a kid. [inaudible] kid, didn't really care to say whatever I wanted, so I got along with everyone very well. I guess when I started learning, I guess, at being more serious in general, a lot of my friends pointed out to me that I was being more serious. I guess also in a certain sense it made me not of a group person, more of an on-my-own person, which I guess if you think about, it makes sense, meaning not really having-- for me, I would make sure I would choose rather-- unless I was being nice to someone else, I would choose rather to be sitting on my own or with someone else to learn than just to hang out. So I guess on one hand, I could technically be chill and relax and have a good time with other people, but usually, I'm very more of a lone person when it comes to learning, and [inaudible] where I want to go. And sometimes, maybe it takes away when you have [inaudible] group of people, friends. It takes away because it takes away from the seriousness of learning. I was just not too serious, but in general, I think it keeps you focused, so that's me with my peers. Definitely when I was younger, I was more of a funny person. When I got older, it gets more of the serious. Also, more with [inaudible] trying to work on myself innerly, [inaudible] changed a lot, meaning thinking over what I say before I say it and kind of not setting a standard higher of how I speak and what I say [crosstalk]."
1744.0,1745.0,Interviewer,That's changed?
1745.0,1750.0,Subject,"For sure, yeah. [inaudible]. Yeah."
1750.0,1752.0,Interviewer,You feel like now you have a higher standard for how to [inaudible]?
1752.0,1815.0,Subject,"I don't know if it's a better standard. I don't know if it's a higher-- I'm just saying, less saying-- setting your bar up. ""I'm not going to say this. I'm not going to speak like that. I'm not going to--"" you know? Also, when I was a kid, I was much more of a nicer person. I didn't really feel like that was so productive in the sense that-- I feel like I always got caught up with-- I don't know. I was nice on my own expense. I didn't really think that was the best attitude to go about because, at the end of the day, if I treat-- if I work on myself and build myself more, then I'll have more to give others versus being nice to someone else on my own expense with my time and my mental capacities to other people. At the end of the day, it just makes me less happy. Can't imagine that this one tiny thing that they gain from me is worth the [inaudible] expense that I'm giving them. These are all ideas I'm talking about with you. I can't imagine you're following anything really too clearly."
1815.0,1827.0,Interviewer,"No, no. It makes sense. It makes perfect sense. [inaudible] just saying is there some traits that you have that you feel like you've consciously tried to change over your life, that's what you're saying?"
