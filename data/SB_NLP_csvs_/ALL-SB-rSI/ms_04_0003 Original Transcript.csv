tmin,tmax,speaker,message
2.0,8.0,Interviewer,Okay. Let's try again. So how are things going for you lately?
8.0,11.0,Subject,"Good, mostly. It's going well."
11.0,16.0,Interviewer,Okay. And what about it is going well?
16.0,40.0,Subject,"Well, right now, I think that - I don't know - I'm happy where I am professionally. So I don't know. I think I'm satisfied with my profession and what I'm doing. And I think it's going mostly-- I think I like where I am."
40.0,43.0,Interviewer,And where is that?
43.0,57.0,Subject,It's in a very nice company. Yeah. And they have different things that they do that other places don't do. So I enjoy that very much.
57.0,59.0,Interviewer,What about it do you enjoy?
59.0,70.0,Subject,"Well, I like-- for instance, yesterday, they paid for us to go to a Broadway show, which was nice. It was my first Broadway show, so--"
70.0,71.0,Interviewer,That sounds fun.
71.0,88.0,Subject,I know [laughter]. It was good. It was nice. I enjoyed it. But I think that's the first time that - I don't know - a company would do that for their employees.
88.0,90.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What did you see?
90.0,92.0,Subject,Carole King.
92.0,93.0,Interviewer,Did you like it?
93.0,101.0,Subject,"I did. It was nice. I didn't know about her story, but now I do. So it was good."
101.0,106.0,Interviewer,What about it do you think spoke to you?
106.0,126.0,Subject,I think the fact that in the music industry that you don't really understand what goes behind the scene because she was mainly a play writer and not a performer. So I think that was very revealing for me.
126.0,127.0,Interviewer,Revealing?
127.0,128.0,Subject,Yeah.
128.0,129.0,Interviewer,In what way?
129.0,149.0,Subject,Things are not always what you think they are. There's always a deeper behind everything that-- even the things that we use every day might have a deeper-- something that you're not truly aware of.
149.0,152.0,Interviewer,A deeper meaning?
152.0,174.0,Subject,I don't know if I'm using the right words. There is things that-- every single thing in this world might have something that you're not aware of. There's always something to learn.
174.0,175.0,Interviewer,Something to learn?
175.0,182.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. And I don't know if that makes sense.
182.0,190.0,Interviewer,"What kinds of things-- you said everything in the world, there's something to learn about. What other kinds of things do you think there's a deeper meaning to?"
190.0,204.0,Subject,"For instance, this Kleenex right? It's just a Kleenex, but there's more behind it than just tissue. There's people behind this simple tissue."
204.0,205.0,Interviewer,People?
205.0,211.0,Subject,Yes [laughter]. It sounds weird. But there's people working to make that tissue.
211.0,220.0,Interviewer,"Oh, I see. Huh. Do you often think about those kinds of stories behind things?"
220.0,260.0,Subject,"Not until yesterday, no. Not until after I saw-- I might have thought about it before. I know there's a lot to learn. But yesterday, seeing how most of the songs that she wrote, I only knew about the performer not her. And it made me realize that there's always something to learn. For everything, there might be-- there might not be, but for most things, there is a deeper story, something behind it."
260.0,261.0,Interviewer,Very cool.
261.0,263.0,Subject,Yeah. Do you get what I mean?
263.0,270.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Can you give me more examples about what you've been thinking about in relation to your own life about it?
270.0,271.0,Subject,My own life?
271.0,274.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm.
274.0,338.0,Subject,"I don't know if it quite relates. Well, okay. I'll tell you how it relates to my own life. So I work at a publishing firm, right. So if you're looking at a website online, you would only see that website. But you don't know that I am-- there's me who's working day and night to make that website happen. And there's 50 people in my department working to make that website happen. That you just think there-- most of time, when I just read something online, I read it and forget about it. I don't think about the people behind what I've just read. That makes sense, right? So it does relate to my life a little bit. But I don't know if it does."
338.0,344.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So I'd love to hear more about your work.
344.0,346.0,Subject,My work?
346.0,347.0,Interviewer,Yep.
347.0,353.0,Subject,There's good and bad days.
353.0,354.0,Interviewer,Give me one of each.
354.0,368.0,Subject,"One of each? Yesterday was a good day because, like I told you, it's a fun place to work. In another instance, they had ice cream cake."
368.0,371.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] [laughter].
371.0,411.0,Subject,"Yeah. They had ice cream cake for everyone because every month they celebrate birthdays. And before going to that Broadway show, they ordered Mexican food [laughter]. I know. I know. I know. So that's why I'm very content with where I am. But at the same time, I think the good and bad day-- bad days will be the stressful day. Today, I messed something up. And I wouldn't mind messing it up, but I messed it up at the third level."
411.0,412.0,Interviewer,At the what level?
412.0,414.0,Subject,Third level. Like you know--
414.0,415.0,Interviewer,Third?
415.0,424.0,Subject,"Yeah, of editing. It was the last level to make sure that it was good, and I messed it up. I don't know if that makes sense."
424.0,426.0,Interviewer,The last level?
426.0,444.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yes. Yes. Well, what they do is that they double-check, triple-check everything that they produce, and I messed it up last level. So I think that--"
444.0,445.0,Interviewer,Messed it up?
445.0,451.0,Subject,"Yes. Yes. I didn't check something. And yeah, that was very stressful."
451.0,452.0,Interviewer,Didn't check something?
452.0,461.0,Subject,"Yes. There's something I needed to check, and I didn't check it. And it was at the last level. Yeah. So--"
461.0,463.0,Interviewer,How does that make you feel?
463.0,467.0,Subject,It was stressful. It was very stressful.
467.0,468.0,Interviewer,Did it work out in the end?
468.0,495.0,Subject,"It did. I work with this specific coworker, and for some reason, most times something goes wrong. I think it might be a pattern. I don't know if she's going to associate me with like, ""Something's going to go wrong. I'm going to have to back her up."" If you know what I mean?"
495.0,497.0,Interviewer,Associated with you?
497.0,498.0,Subject,Yeah.
498.0,499.0,Interviewer,Associate what?
499.0,502.0,Subject,Mistakes with me.
502.0,504.0,Interviewer,And you said back her up?
504.0,518.0,Subject,"Yeah, like she's going to have to fix my mistake. If you know what I mean?"
518.0,526.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm. So what kind of mistakes are kind of most common in what you do?
526.0,540.0,Subject,It's writing. So writing has to be perfect. So sometimes things related to that would come up.
540.0,546.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And you said you're very content now, is that different from before?"
546.0,556.0,Subject,I think so. I think so. Yeah. I think I enjoy it. It's a good place to work.
556.0,558.0,Interviewer,As opposed to what you were doing before?
558.0,560.0,Subject,Yes.
560.0,561.0,Interviewer,How so?
561.0,578.0,Subject,"I mean, the work, I did not quite enjoy it as much. I don't know. It was just the environment."
578.0,579.0,Interviewer,The environment?
579.0,588.0,Subject,"Yeah, the environment, like the people there. It was not as nice. The people were not as friendly."
588.0,589.0,Interviewer,"Oh, really?"
589.0,592.0,Subject,Uh-huh. Yeah. They were not as friendly.
592.0,594.0,Interviewer,In what ways?
594.0,630.0,Subject,"Okay. I'll give you a specific example. My manager, before, she-- if I were to say, ""Good morning"" to her, she would just give me the sad-eye [laughter]. I know. The, ""Who are you?"" But now, my manager, she goes out of her way. I think that she's-- I feel bad that I'm making her do extra work to make me feel comfortable."
630.0,631.0,Interviewer,Extra work?
631.0,640.0,Subject,"Yeah, because I feel like she tries to be nice to me but for some reason I can't let my guard down."
640.0,641.0,Interviewer,Your guard down?
641.0,643.0,Subject,Yeah.
643.0,644.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by that?
644.0,668.0,Subject,"I feel like sometimes she tries to be my friend or something, but I can't let that happen for some reason. I try, but since I'm-- I don't know if I try too hard too-- or if I try too hard or if I'm not trying enough. So I just don't. It's very complicated."
668.0,669.0,Interviewer,Trying of what?
669.0,679.0,Subject,"Trying to be friendly to her as well. But then, I don't know, sometimes I just don't try."
679.0,681.0,Interviewer,And why do you think that is?
681.0,692.0,Subject,I don't know. Because I'm probably overthinking it. But she's probably overthinking it [laughter].
692.0,693.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by overthinking?
693.0,710.0,Subject,"I don't know. Because she tries so-- I'm not saying she tries hard, but she's nice. And from my experiences before, I'm more accustomed to people just not caring. So it's different."
710.0,712.0,Interviewer,I see. Like from your past experiences?
712.0,721.75,Subject,"Yeah. And from what I know, it's different. So now I don't know how to handle it."
721.75,722.0,Interviewer,Hmm.
722.0,725.0,Subject,Yeah.
725.0,737.0,Interviewer,Do you think that you like this better than what you were doing before?
737.0,742.0,Subject,I think so. I think so. I think I like the culture. I like the work. And--
742.0,744.0,Interviewer,What's different about the work?
744.0,779.0,Subject,"The first one was more automatic. I don't know. It was the same thing over and over again, and I almost didn't have to use my brain to do it. That's how simple it was. But this one, even though I find that I want it to be perfect, but I still have to be present. And then when I let go is when I'm most likely to do something, then it crumbles."
779.0,781.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by let go?
781.0,820.0,Subject,"When you're trying to-- how can I explain it? When you're trying to-- when you do something everyday, and the first time you do it you're very concerned about it to be good. But with the 50th time you do it, then you're like,""It's probably going to be good because I've checked it 49 times."" But that 50th time that you just say, ""Okay. It'll be fine."" And then something bad happens because you were not as attentive. So that's what I mean."
820.0,829.0,Interviewer,Okay. Very cool. Okay. So do you feel like that's what happened today?
829.0,842.0,Subject,"Yeah [laughter], because I did not check-- it was a link. I did not check it. Every time I always check all the links. But that time, I didn't check it."
842.0,843.0,Interviewer,A link?
843.0,847.75,Subject,"Yeah, if we use link on what we do. Like links--"
847.75,848.0,Interviewer,Like a hyperlink?
848.0,851.0,Subject,"Yeah, hyperlink. And I did not check it."
851.0,858.0,Interviewer,So what do you check? Can you describe to me what you're checking and what you're doing?
858.0,879.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. I'm going to try and keep it as simple as-- like hyperlinks. There's hyperlinks that I need to check before it goes to another department and then the viewers get to see it. I had already sent it to that other department.
879.0,880.0,Interviewer,I see.
880.0,893.0,Subject,"So not only was my mistake known by my group, but it was also known by that other department. And I think that-- I don't know. I did not like that."
893.0,895.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
895.0,897.0,Subject,"I know, it's--"
897.0,900.0,Interviewer,But it seems like it turned out okay?
900.0,911.0,Subject,"Yes. But I feel like when the person thinks of me again, they might think of that one situation that happened and--"
911.0,912.0,Interviewer,Really?
912.0,938.0,Subject,"Yeah, because people tend to remember bad things. Because every week it's good, that one week it wasn't okay, then she might remember that more than all the weeks that they weren't. You don't think so? I think so. She might remember it more. No?"
938.0,947.0,Interviewer,"No. I think if you have so many positive experiences and only one bad one, it'll get overwritten in the future."
947.0,959.0,Subject,All right. All right. I'll let it go. I'll let it go. I did not like. It was tough. I was stressing about it.
959.0,972.0,Interviewer,No. I've gotten a good sense of how things have been recently. What do you see for the future?
972.0,1011.0,Subject,"Okay. So right now I'm not quite sure about the future because I'm trying to-- because in my work line, for me to go to the next level, I would need to go back and get a degree. Right? In that specific work line. But I have so many options that I find it hard-- it's just every single option has their advantages and disadvantages, so I don't know what to do. And--"
1011.0,1014.0,Interviewer,So what are the options?
1014.0,1056.0,Subject,"Oh, there's so many options. So I could either become a lawyer, which is that line that I'm telling you about. Or I could get a simple master's degree. Or I could get a business degree. Or I could just move up in the company and not try to get any degree at all. And every single one requires so much work and attention that I cannot just-- let's say today I decide to choose one of them, I have to commit to that one because to make it happen it takes a lot of work. You see what I mean?"
1056.0,1057.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm.
1057.0,1060.0,Subject,Yeah. So--
1060.0,1061.0,Interviewer,So a lot of work?
1061.0,1083.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. Every single option it takes a lot-- because I don't have that much time [laughter]. [inaudible]. I only have four hours every day to commit to that if I want to do something else.
1083.0,1095.0,Interviewer,So it seems like you've been thinking a lot about this. What made you pick these options? What makes those stand out to you?
1095.0,1151.0,Subject,"I think the pressure is to find something that align with what I've already done. Yeah. So it's just what has already been written out, I guess, for me. So I feel that if-- let's say I want to go to a totally different field, like an artist or something, I can't do that because I've been doing this specific work for this amount of time. And even to become an artist, then I feel like I would have to turn back to being like a five-year-old in order to-- it's just that from what I've done so far, those are my options."
1151.0,1153.0,Interviewer,Those are your options?
1153.0,1155.0,Subject,Yeah.
1155.0,1156.0,Interviewer,Does one in particular--
1156.0,1157.0,Subject,That appeals to me?
1157.0,1159.0,Interviewer,--speak to you?
1159.0,1205.0,Subject,"I think because-- I know that this will sound so weird. I've always been someone that I can do anything, I don't need to be passionate about it. I'll do it. It's just I get so jealous about being who have this one passion. And I get so jealous. I wish I had this passion and I'm dying for it. I don't have that because I feel like I can do anything. And I'm interested in so many things that-- I don't know. That's why I feel like I don't know what to do next."
1205.0,1208.0,Interviewer,So you see a difference between passion and interest?
1208.0,1214.0,Subject,"No, a difference between passion and work."
1214.0,1220.0,Interviewer,But you said you're interested in a lot of things. You don't think you're passionate about them?
1220.0,1235.0,Subject,"Mm-mm. I'm not passionate about it. I'll just do it and say, ""Oh, it's interesting,"" but I'm not passionate about anything."
1235.0,1237.0,Interviewer,So what do you feel is the difference?
1237.0,1247.0,Subject,"Interests is like a thought, something I can do. But passion is something I have--"
1247.0,1248.0,Interviewer,A thought?
1248.0,1296.0,Subject,"Yeah. Sorry. For instance, today I could be interested in fitness and tomorrow I could be interested in cooking. But I'm not passionate about fitness enough to become a fitness coach. Or I'm not passionate about cooking enough to be come the best chef of - I don't know - anything that you can think of. Yeah, so. It's just that I don't know. Right now-- I don't know. ""You see, you don't even know what you think because you seem confused."""
1296.0,1301.75,Interviewer,"No, I think I understand. I understand. It's interesting."
1301.75,1302.0,Subject,Do you think so?
1302.0,1320.0,Interviewer,Yeah [laughter]. So do you think you'll stay in your job very long? You seem content. What do you see in the short-term?
1320.0,1340.0,Subject,"I think in the short-term, my ideal situation would be that I don't have to worry about getting another degree. Then I would just stay there. But I don't think it's feasible for me to stay there."
1340.0,1341.0,Interviewer,Why not?
1341.0,1350.0,Subject,Because then I won't move up. I won't have a career. So it's just--
1350.0,1351.0,Interviewer,You won't have a career--
1351.0,1352.0,Subject,Mm-mm.
1352.0,1353.0,Interviewer,--if you stay?
1353.0,1373.0,Subject,"Yeah, because the next stop is you need to get a degree. Yeah. I can't be at the lower level forever, even though it seems like the best job. It's a good place to work. It's a good place to work."
1373.0,1375.0,Interviewer,And so you need one of those degrees?
1375.0,1389.0,Subject,"Yeah. Or I could just move to a different department and just do that. And in a different department, I could do Rotational Program."
1389.0,1390.0,Interviewer,A what?
1390.0,1445.0,Subject,"Rotational Program. It's when you-- so let's say in Human Resources, there's employee relations, there's payroll, payroll and-- there's so many other things, right? So you want to do a Rotational Program. So every month or every few weeks you sit with one of those branches and then you get an idea of what they're like. So it gives you a broader perspective of what's [inaudible] Human Resource for you. And let's say if you choose to do payroll or employee relations, then you know from experience."
1445.0,1449.0,Interviewer,So how does that work? They allow you to just kind of observe and then you can choose?
1449.0,1480.0,Subject,I'm not totally sure. But I know that you probably do some of the work. Let's say they will allow you to do one project or something and then you decide afterwards. I think in our department we had someone do a Rotational Program and he produced his own document.
1480.0,1481.0,Interviewer,Document?
1481.0,1493.0,Subject,"Yeah, we produce documents. And he was a-- [laughter] one document. So he got an idea of what we do."
1493.0,1494.0,Interviewer,So a document?
1494.0,1496.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah. A document.
1496.0,1498.0,Interviewer,What kind of document?
1498.0,1513.0,Subject,How can I explain it? Let's say an article. He was about to write one. Yeah. So that's what he did.
1513.0,1515.0,Interviewer,Okay. So these articles then go to the website?
1515.0,1520.0,Subject,Yeah. And then people read it.
1520.0,1523.0,Interviewer,So what kinds of articles are they?
1523.0,1534.0,Subject,"I don't know if I want to explain. It's about the field. It's about the field. And it's different topics. So, yeah."
1534.0,1536.0,Interviewer,Okay. Okay. Cool.
1536.0,1538.0,Subject,Yeah. We got--
1538.0,1544.0,Interviewer,So what do you think about this rotational process interests you?
1544.0,1548.75,Subject,You saw all the options that I gave you?
1548.75,1549.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm.
1549.0,1571.0,Subject,"So either get one of those degrees. Then if I don't get one of those degrees, then I would do Rotational Program in a different department that doesn't need a degree. Then I would be able to move up in that different department. Yeah. So that's the fourth option."
1571.0,1578.0,Interviewer,Okay. And so is there a particular department that interests you?
1578.0,1603.0,Subject,"No. No. No, not really. I have to take a look into it more. I have to look into it more. But I wish I could stay in that company though so I can eat more ice cream cake [laughter]."
1603.0,1609.0,Interviewer,"I feel you. That sounds so nice. Broadway shows, ice cream."
1609.0,1611.0,Subject,Yeah. It was good. It was good.
1611.0,1613.0,Interviewer,So it was your first Broadway show?
1613.0,1616.0,Subject,"Yeah, it was my first Broadway show."
1616.0,1619.0,Interviewer,Is that something you think you'll do again?
1619.0,1662.0,Subject,"I think so, but then I would have to pay for it. Yeah. Yeah. And then we got the best seats. We got orchestra. I know. I know. I know. That's why I like it. But then I don't know what to do next. It's hard. I wish I could stay there. I want to stay there but I don't know how. I feel like I would feel really bad if I were to go get a degree and then I can't come back to--"
1662.0,1665.0,Interviewer,Why do you think you wouldn't be able to go back?
1665.0,1690.0,Subject,"I don't know. I don't know why. Let's say if the timing-- jobs are all about timing. Yeah. It's the wrong timing. There's no position open and then I can't go back. It's probably would be another branch-- another tree too of choice. You know, so--"
1690.0,1697.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay. But do you think there's another company you could work at that's similar if you got a degree?
1697.0,1710.0,Subject,"Yeah, there probably is. There probably is but you just have to look for that."
1710.0,1719.0,Interviewer,And would you do the same work if you could? It seems like you're okay moving around in departments but is there--?
1719.0,1742.0,Subject,"You see. You see. That's what I was telling you, the difference between interests and passion. I could do anything, but can I find something that I'm passionate about. I feel like until I find something I'm really passionate about, then I will have many interests."
1742.0,1745.0,Interviewer,How do you think you'll find something you're passionate about?
1745.0,1749.0,Subject,I haven't found it. So--
1749.0,1751.0,Interviewer,But how do you think it's try?
1751.0,1752.0,Subject,You'd try to find one?
1752.0,1756.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How do you do that?
1756.0,1777.0,Subject,"I don't know. I don't know. I feel like it will come naturally. It's something that you feel. It will come naturally. Yeah, I don't think you can look for one. I don't think you can look for one."
1777.0,1779.0,Interviewer,Okay. Never thought of that.
1779.0,1783.0,Subject,You've never thought--? I think about that every day.
1783.0,1784.0,Interviewer,Interesting. Every day?
1784.0,1786.0,Subject,Every day.
1786.0,1801.0,Interviewer,That's so funny. I think that maybe you don't want to just kind of happen to pop up. You don't think you'll find one in graduate school or like getting a degree?
1801.0,1832.0,Subject,"Mm-mm. No. I don't think so. Mm-mm. No. Because I might have other interests. Oh, I know why. Because then you don't know the outcome of you're interests. You don't know. Let's say, if I-- I think I'm very worried about the outcome."
1832.0,1833.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by outcome?
1833.0,1864.0,Subject,"Will I be content, or happy, or--? I feel it's the fear of not-- what if I dedicate my time to that one thing and this thing doesn't give me the outcome that I was hoping for? And then when I get there, it's like, ""Oh, no. I should have done this other thing."" You get what I'm--?"
1864.0,1868.0,Interviewer,You can't just go try the other thing?
1868.0,1877.0,Subject,What about all the time? That's what I said. I would have to go back to being nine because I've already spent time.
1877.0,1892.0,Interviewer,So you don't feel like you could just try to join another field or do something different? You think you'd have to go back in time? You don't think you could just hop around? You're talking about going to a different department [laughter] [crosstalk].
1892.0,1915.0,Subject,"I mean, do I think I could just hop around? Okay. Okay. But then I won't be a specialist and I'll just be a beginner at so many things. I won't be really good at that thing and I won't be considered passionate."
1915.0,1917.0,Interviewer,"So being a specialist, is that something that you want?"
1917.0,1941.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Let's say when people think about me and they're like, ""Oh, Karen. She's good at this thing-- she's really good at this thing."" Because the people who are good-- let's say singer's like Beyonce. She's really good at singing. Right? Right?"
1941.0,1943.0,Interviewer,"Oh, yes."
1943.0,1952.0,Subject,"If you need a cook, you're not going to call Beyonce [laughter]. You see what I mean?"
1952.0,1960.0,Interviewer,Okay. So you really want to feel like there's something that you are particularly good at?
1960.0,1961.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
1961.0,1964.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that?
1964.0,1999.0,Subject,"I don't know. I haven't thought about it. Then it would be like-- it would be something to be-- I feel like I would be well-regarded if I'm good at this thing or maybe I'm good at many things. It's just that for me to get to that point, then I feel that I have to dedicate my attention to that one thing and then get rid of all the other things. But then I worry about choosing the right one."
1999.0,2001.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you mean get rid of all the other options?"
2001.0,2031.0,Subject,"Yes, choosing the right one. And then because I haven't chosen the right one, then I'm not doing anything. And then I'm just like, ""Okay. What do I do?"" So now I keep thinking about it, thinking about it every day. And I feel like time is passing by and I'm still thinking. And I haven't done anything. Well, I have done but I haven't done more to move me forward."
2031.0,2035.0,Interviewer,So moving forward is really your focus?
2035.0,2042.0,Subject,"Yes. And, yeah."
2042.0,2048.0,Interviewer,What do you think would happen if you just stayed where you are? You said before that you think you couldn't.
2048.0,2050.0,Subject,In what sense?
2050.0,2051.0,Interviewer,In your position now.
2051.0,2053.0,Subject,My current job?
2053.0,2056.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Why couldn't you just stay?
2056.0,2070.75,Subject,Because then how could you be one thing for-- I don't think I would be part of myself if I spend 10 years in one job.
2070.75,2071.0,Interviewer,Really?
2071.0,2074.0,Subject,Yes. I don't think--
2074.0,2077.0,Interviewer,Why?
2077.0,2095.0,Subject,Remember what I told you about the first job? Then it would definitely become that first job because I would be doing the same thing over and over again for 10 years. And I think I would just be unsatisfied with myself.
2095.0,2096.0,Interviewer,Unsatisfied with yourself?
2096.0,2115.0,Subject,"Yeah, unsatisfied. That feel of [laughter]-- yeah. That feeling of unsatisfaction. I think I want to. You see, I think about this every day."
2115.0,2116.0,Interviewer,Every day?
2116.0,2123.0,Subject,"Probably not every day, but a lot of those days."
2123.0,2125.0,Interviewer,So it's a big part of your life?
2125.0,2129.0,Subject,"Yes, it's like one big part."
2129.0,2132.0,Interviewer,"It's like when you go home at the end of the day, is it something you think about?"
2132.0,2138.75,Subject,"Yes, because then, I had told you, I have four hours. And--"
2138.75,2139.0,Interviewer,After work you mean?
2139.0,2161.0,Subject,"After work, yeah. I have four hours to dedicate to myself. I have to do everything and then that four hours is very precious for me. If I don't use those four hours wisely, which I haven't been--"
2161.0,2162.0,Interviewer,You haven't?
2162.0,2164.0,Subject,"No, I haven't been."
2164.0,2165.0,Interviewer,What do you mean?
2165.0,2186.0,Subject,"Because at this point, I haven't decided. So to not overthink it, then I just don't think about it. And then the next day, it's the same cycle over and over again."
2186.0,2197.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Well, I think I can stop the recording now. But it sounds like you have a lot of very good options and a lot of very good plans."
2197.0,2220.0,Subject,"Yes, but like I told you, it's difficult. I don't know. I don't know if you have the same thoughts."
