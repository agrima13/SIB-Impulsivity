1.0,23.0,Interviewer,"Okay, cool. So, we are recording. Like I said, the point of this is really informal, and I just sort of would like to know what it's like being you, being Irma. So, can you tell me, how are things going right now? What's it like?"
23.0,55.0,Subject,"Well, things are going okay. I'm excited because school is almost over, which means summer vacation. And I guess with me, what it's like being Irma, I like to read a lot, and I was recently talking about how I hadn't been to a lot of book discussions recently and I want to go back to start doing those. And also, I think last time I mentioned, how I like grammar and semantics and linguistics, so I want to start reading grammar books again."
55.0,57.0,Interviewer,"So, you haven't been reading as much as you'd like to?"
57.0,82.75,Subject,"Yes. Because I feel like with lesson plans and school, you just get tired and if you pick up a book, it's hard to retain anything. So, I want to do that, and I like the summer because I feel like the warmer weather makes my blood flow properly. So, I want to do that: a lot of beach days, because, actually, one of my favorite things to do is read by the beach."
82.75,83.0,Interviewer,Read by the beach?
83.0,84.0,Subject,Yes.
84.0,86.0,Interviewer,Wow.
86.0,102.0,Subject,"Anything else? I like listening to music. I have a lot of playlists set up on YouTube, so I'll do that as I'm walking. What else, what else? What else is there about me?"
102.0,106.75,Interviewer,"So, what are the-- So, you've done book clubs before, huh? Book discussion groups?"
106.75,107.0,Subject,Yes.
107.0,109.0,Interviewer,What are those like?
109.0,156.0,Subject,"Oh, those are fun because you get to hear people's different perspectives about the book. And they're really fun because in college, they give you-- especially if you're doing any kind of English literature class-- they'll say something like, ""Read chapters 15 to 20 and do a reading response."" And you'll have that, say for like 3 or 4 classes, and no one actually reads [laughter] chapters 15 to 20. So, it's kind of like you skim around the book. You've read the first half and maybe the last half and a sliver of the middle, but there's this whole point where you haven't read and you have to sit there when the professor's talking. It's like, ""Yeah, I remember where that happened,"" when you really have no idea."
156.0,157.0,Interviewer,You have to BS your way through that [laughter].
157.0,195.0,Subject,"You have to BS. So, I found that with the book discussions, when it came to some of the books I was actually assigned in college, I was like, ""Oh, that's what happened. That's the part of what they meant."" Because I remember before in school, because it was so much, it's-- do you know SparkNotes? You have to go with the synopsis and [laughter]-- No, SparkNotes was a lifesaver because they even have a section where they analyze the quotes. And you make sure you raise your hand, and I would always make sure I raised my hand early to get my participation in so you can't say [laughter] I didn't participate."
195.0,201.0,Interviewer,"So, the SparkNotes gave you even stuff to say in class for the analyzing stuff."
201.0,214.0,Subject,"But now, when you actually read, you get to read the book and do the reading that you didn't do. So, I think I may do that this summer: dig up some of those old books and do the reading I didn't do."
214.0,223.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So, why is it different from college? You have more time now? When you do the discussions."
223.0,284.0,Subject,"You have more time, and it's freer because you don't have to turn in a response. You're not being graded on it. Because even with the responses, you do what you can to get the best grade. So, if you know, for instance, that your professor has a certain slant, there's certain things you're not going to harp on. Because I remember we were reading ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" and I only remember it briefly, but I remember it was one part when I did a response to it. I guess it was a guy he had really bad character, but he did something good. And I said in my response, ""It's nice that he did something good, but doing something good doesn't change you. It doesn't change your overall character, and it doesn't absolve the bad that you've done."" And I remember my professor said, ""Well, that's not fair."" [laughter] So, it's things like that."
284.0,288.0,Interviewer,"So, the book clubs, there's not such harsh criticism to--"
288.0,296.0,Subject,"Yes. So, you can be open with your opinion because it's just your sharing. You don't have to worry about, ""I'm getting graded by a professor and--"""
296.0,302.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So, no one's really leading it. No one's in charge of you. It's just--"
302.0,330.0,Subject,"It's [inaudible]. Oh, and I mentioned my family and I, we might go to Disney World this summer because we have a lot of younger cousins and they want to go to the amusement parks and go on the roller coaster rides. I don't know about the roller coaster rides because that feeling of spinning in the air-- it's terrifying. So, I may skip the roller coaster rides, but I am excited about Disney World."
330.0,338.0,Interviewer,"So, you're excited about Disney World but a little apprehensive about having to go on the rides?"
338.0,342.0,Subject,"Well, yeah, the roller coaster rides. I love the water park."
342.0,345.0,Interviewer,What do you love about the water park?
345.0,380.0,Subject,"Oh, because we usually go in Orlando, Florida. It's a different kind of heat. I don't even know how to describe it. It's like literally, I guess, sitting inside of a volcano [laughter]. It gets that hot. It gets really, really, really hot. So, when you go there, you go through the water ride. And it's like a tugboat thing and it shifts a few times, and at a certain point, there's a stream of water that comes down on you and it's the most refreshing feeling ever."
380.0,389.0,Interviewer,Like pouring water onto someone covered in volcano lava or something.
389.0,399.0,Subject,And it's a part where they give you the history of Disney. You go on this long train ride. That was nice too.
399.0,401.0,Interviewer,"So, you've been to Disney before."
401.0,413.0,Subject,"Yes. I'm a walker. I like to walk a lot. I feel like walking is soothing to the soul, so I really enjoy walking."
413.0,416.0,Interviewer,Definitely. What do you mean?
416.0,477.0,Subject,"Oh, I feel like when you walk, your thoughts are freer. Everything flows like a stream, and you can just be. And now, there's this app. It's called Sweatcoin, and it's basically, they say they pay you for walking. It's kind of like their version of cryptocurrency. And it's for when you're walking, but it's only outside. Not if you're walking indoors, but whenever you're walking outside, you make sure you have the app running and it tracks your steps. And the way they have it at this point, the most you can earn is $20 per day and they have different incentives. And I guess the most appealing one is that once you get to 20,000 Sweatcoins, you can turn in your Sweatcoins for $1,000 PayPal Cash."
477.0,482.0,Interviewer,Wow. Sweatcoin. And it can turn into real money.
482.0,491.0,Subject,"You can turn it into real money. They have that. They have Amazon cards, Forever 21. They have different offers."
491.0,492.0,Interviewer,"Wow. So, you've been doing this?"
492.0,503.0,Subject,"Yeah. Because I figured, why not? I walk anyway, and I like that it's an app that I don't have to change my life to do. I'm like, ""Okay."""
503.0,505.0,Interviewer,Have you made very much money yet?
505.0,509.0,Subject,I think I made 700 and 7 something dollars.
509.0,511.0,Interviewer,Dollars? Not even the Sweatcoins? It's real money?
511.0,524.0,Subject,"Oh, no, no. It's in Sweatcoins. When you get to 20,000 Sweatcoins, you can convert it to real money, to the $1,000. But so far, I think I've made like 775 Sweatcoins [laughter]."
524.0,529.0,Interviewer,Wow. Cool. How long does that take?
529.0,538.0,Subject,"Well, what did they say? They said you can earn the 20,000 Sweatcoins in 18 months."
538.0,544.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So, that's been fun, even though you already like walking. It makes it even more fun, it sounds like."
544.0,613.0,Subject,"Yes. What else do I like to do? What do I think to do? It's so interesting when someone asks you, ""What do you do?"" Because it's funny, I remember when I majored in journalism, and I would write for the paper. And you'd have to have a certain way of interviewing because some people are naturally talkers, but then other people, it's like pulling teeth [laughter]. But then being on the other side, I get it now. It's like, ""What do I do? What is it about me?"" I like to read. I like to write. I like to listen to-- Oh, I like going to movies. And there's this thing, what is it? It's called Movie View, and it's where you can get these free movie screenings. And they had one-- I forget the name of the movie, but it's based on a James Baldwin novel. And I saw it recently, and it was at AMC Empire 25 on 42nd Street. And the thing about is-- well, besides it being a free movie-- you eat for free."
613.0,614.0,Interviewer,Really?
614.0,631.0,Subject,"So, all their stuff, and what do they have? They have pizza, Frank's Curly Fries, the popcorn, the pretzel bites, all that stuff. You can literally get as much as you want. So, say you wanted to get this whole table full of food, you could if you wanted to."
631.0,635.0,Interviewer,"Wow. That's fun. So, you've gone to that a couple of times?"
635.0,655.0,Subject,"Yeah. And I guess that's the great thing about New York is: there's always something to do during summer. So, between the concerts and the festivals, there's always something. What else, what else, what else? And I do go to the concerts in the park too."
655.0,657.0,Interviewer,Oh yeah? Concerts in the park? In Central Park?
657.0,697.0,Subject,"In Central Park. They have some in Brooklyn. They just built up the Amphitheater in Coney Island. Oh, and that's something. Well, Coney Island tends to be-- well, I would say, a yearly trip. Yearly versus whenever my family from North Carolina comes up because they always like to go to Luna Park. So, even though for the most part I eat healthy, I do use that time to kind of pig out on junk food. What I'll get, I'll go to Nathan's, and I'll get the two hot dogs with mustard and onions and all the fries with lots of ketchup and then a tall lemonade."
697.0,700.0,Interviewer,Oh yeah [laughter]. That's great.
700.0,702.0,Subject,It's a treat because I don't normally eat-- [laughter].
702.0,705.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So, when your family comes up, you usually go down there?"
705.0,732.0,Subject,"Yeah. We usually go because-- But I guess whenever they come up, my diet, the way I eat, goes off-kilter because typically, I like to eat stuff. I like to eat a lot of green juices. I like the veggie burgers and the quinoa burgers and the kale chips and broccoli florets and things of that nature. So then, that stuff is boring because they like to eat--"
732.0,735.0,Interviewer,"They're like, ""We just came up here for Luna Park to eat the garbage."" [laughter]"
735.0,766.0,Subject,"I know. So, I have to kind of suck it up [laughter] to a certain degree. But I've been working on them and trying to give them tips about-- for instance, I said the seltzer water with the flavors. No one likes that. So, I said, ""You can do juice, but pour water in it so that you can have the sweetness."" And they didn't like that either. So, I said, ""Fine. Just drink the regular juice."" And then, afterwards, just drink water."""
766.0,769.0,Interviewer,"So, they're a tough sell to get them to eat the healthy stuff, huh?"
769.0,783.0,Subject,"Yeah. I try to understand because I do like healthy eating, but I realize that everyone isn't as into it as I am. So, I try not to be a lecturer while I'm sharing my enthusiasm of it."
783.0,787.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Are you ever afraid that you might come off as being a lecturer?
787.0,830.0,Subject,"Sometimes, just because of how much I talk about it, but I only talk about it so much because-- I mentioned last time-- March made one year since I stopped taking over-the-counter medicines. And I used to take them all the time. And you think about the difference because if you go to, say, a pharmacy and you have the daytime and nighttime version, I think for the packets, like 9 or 10 dollars versus garlic is like 69 cents a bulb or ginger is a dollar and change for-- depending on which bunch you get because they charge by weight."
830.0,831.0,Interviewer,"So, they're less expensive, doing those."
831.0,846.0,Subject,"Yes. And it tastes good because I guess that was my thing about natural eating, my apprehension to it was at first. I didn't think that it was going to taste good, and I like my food to taste good."
846.0,851.0,Interviewer,"But you found a way to make it taste good, it sounds like. Or you just find that it tastes good naturally by itself?"
851.0,863.0,Subject,"Oh, no. I find that a lot of it tastes good naturally by itself. But that's the thing: I always say, I don't do natural and nasty. Even if it's good for me, if it doesn't taste good, I can't hang in there."
863.0,865.0,Interviewer,You don't do natural and nasty?
865.0,870.0,Subject,Yeah. Because the wheat grass shots are--
870.0,871.0,Interviewer,Wheat grass shots?
871.0,884.0,Subject,"Yes. The little shot and they say it's-- what do they say-- they say, ""One wheat grass shot is the equivalent of eating a whole bunch of fruits and vegetables."" But it tastes bad."
884.0,885.0,Interviewer,"Oh, a shot like a small amount."
885.0,902.0,Subject,"Yes. I can't do it. That tastes bad, the Noni juice tastes-- It's something. It's called Noni juice, and it comes in a bottle like the apple cider vinegar bottle. That tastes bad too."
902.0,917.0,Interviewer,"You try a lot of different healthy kind of things, huh? And some are nasty [laughter]. So, what else do you usually do when your family comes up to visit?"
917.0,944.0,Subject,"Some of them live in New York, so I'll go and visit some of the family I don't get to see that much. We have family that live out in Queens, but I rarely, rarely, rarely go out in Queens, so that'll be a treat. And they like to do barbecues. So, I will do that, but I always say, ""I'll bring the cups, the plates, the utensils,"" because I'm very culinarily challenged."
944.0,949.0,Interviewer,"Oh really? Oh, so you don't have to cook anything [laughter]. Is that what you mean?"
949.0,956.0,Subject,"Yes. Well, I'll bring like a fruit platter sometimes. They like fruit."
956.0,960.0,Interviewer,You could bring them some of the wheat grass shots [laughter]. They'll be like-- [laughter].
960.0,965.0,Subject,"I know, I know."
965.0,968.0,Interviewer,"So, what are the barbecues usually like? You've done them before?"
968.0,992.0,Subject,"Oh, yes. There's a whole bunch of the family, a family that we don't get to see that often. We come together. We eat. We hang out. We have a good time. We play cards. Someone will bring a jump rope, and I'll jump rope or I'll turn. And there'll be someone watching the kids. A lot of times, usually, that's me too."
992.0,993.0,Interviewer,Watching the kids?
993.0,1000.0,Subject,Just to make sure they don't go wander too far or we don't see them.
1000.0,1004.0,Interviewer,"So, they know you're the teacher and you must know how to watch the kids [laughter]?"
1004.0,1007.0,Subject,"I know. Well, it's a break for the parents, which I don't mind."
1007.0,1011.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So, it's fun watching the kids usually?"
1011.0,1054.0,Subject,"It is. They have very interesting-- because kids are very unfiltered, so they'll say what comes to their minds [laughter] as it comes to their minds. And you get to learn a lot of new stuff from them. Because I think it was from them how I learned about Doc McStuffins. Oh, she's the doctor, and she takes care of pets. I didn't know. My cousin said-- he sent a text out, like an invitation text, and it was an invitation to his daughter's party. And he said Doc McStuffins, so I had to text back, ""Doc McStuffins? Who's that?"" And he was trying to tell me, ""Oh, she's a doctor who takes care--"" [laughter] I know."
1054.0,1056.0,Interviewer,That was the theme of the party?
1056.0,1061.0,Subject,Yeah. I didn't know it was a person [laughter].
1061.0,1064.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, always learning new, interesting things from kids, huh?"
1064.0,1080.0,Subject,"I know. Because I think about their parallels in relation to the cartoons I had growing up. I remember Captain Planet, Inspector Gadget, The Flintstones, The Jetsons, [laughter]."
1080.0,1083.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Did you watch a lot of cartoons?
1083.0,1098.0,Subject,"I did. And I liked-- what was it-- it was Schoolhouse Rock because they taught about the different parts of speech, so I always remember: ""Conjunction junction, what's your function?"""
1098.0,1105.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I remember that too.
1105.0,1143.0,Subject,"So, yeah, I did. I watched cartoons, but when it came to what I wanted to watch, if I was over at my cousin's house, I had to be strategic and I had to sneak up and watch it early because I was the only girl and it was a bunch of boys. So, they liked GI Joe and all the army cartoons and all the fighting cartoons. And I wanted to watch Barbie and The Care Bears, but they wouldn't let me watch that. And sometimes, very rarely, I would get through a whole show, but they would come in and they would see what I was watching and just turn the channel."
1143.0,1145.0,Interviewer,Ugh. How rude [laughter].
1145.0,1151.0,Subject,I know.
1151.0,1154.0,Interviewer,"So, you had different tastes than them in cartoons, huh?"
1154.0,1164.0,Subject,"Yes. But after that, I started where I would just go and read a book or something."
1164.0,1165.0,Interviewer,"And you like to read on the beach, huh?"
1165.0,1237.0,Subject,"I like to read, and actually I'll go to the library and pick out a book and sit there and read. I think that actually the library is one of my favorite places. That's why I'm glad we still have it around, because I'm signed up to their email list and they were talking about how some of them were in danger of closing. So, if you like the library, sign a petition and let the senators and politicians know that you're interested. Because I feel like they have very underutilized resources. You can learn how to code in the library. You can take language lessons there. Yeah, it was at Countee Cullen Library in Harlem. There's a few years back, I think it was. I learned HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, and it's all for free. But they don't treat it like a free program. You get handouts and learning materials. You go over real-life examples. You go on the web and you look at real websites, and you look at the properties and you get to actually see the code and you break down what it means."
1237.0,1239.0,Interviewer,Wow. That's so fun.
1239.0,1272.0,Subject,"It was amazing. When I was learning French, I was learning it at the library. And it was good because it was immersion and the lady only spoke in French, but it helped. And they had it for all of them. What is it? Spanish, French, Korean, Italian, and a few other languages. They'll have it at beginner, intermediate, and advanced."
1272.0,1277.0,Interviewer,Wow. That's so many wonderful things at the library.
1277.0,1285.0,Subject,"They really do, and they have the book discussions and-- what is it? Just different computer programs you can learn."
1285.0,1289.0,Interviewer,"So, the book discussions you've done are at the library too. Cool."
1289.0,1302.0,Subject,"Some of them were at the library, and some of them also have been at the different Barnes and Nobles. I know the Barnes & Noble at Union Square does them a lot."
1302.0,1305.0,Interviewer,"So, it sounds like the library and Barnes & Noble are some of your favorite places."
1305.0,1325.0,Subject,"Yes. It's bad, but I've gone to Barnes & Noble and I've read like 200-page books in one sitting. But I do have the Barnes & Noble membership that I do use, so it's not just I'm coming there to read the books and then never contribute [laughter]. I do."
1325.0,1329.0,Interviewer,"That's funny. Because they do have nice sitting areas there, right?"
1329.0,1330.0,Subject,They do.
1330.0,1336.0,Interviewer,"And they don't want people to do that, then they shouldn't [laughter] have the sitting areas there."
1336.0,1344.0,Subject,"What else do I-- What else? Well, I don't know if there's--"
1344.0,1347.0,Interviewer,"So, what do you like to read?"
1347.0,1411.0,Subject,"I like to read a lot of the Sue Grafton books. I also like to read some of the Sue Grafton's, some of the James Patterson's. I like to read grammar books. I like to read books about etymology and linguistics. I like to read some psychology books. What else? I toyed with the idea of doing a blog, so I like to read some of those books. I like to read a lot of the health and nutrition books because I have a blender. So, it's about getting different smoothie and green juice recipes. I like to read a lot of inspirational books. Is that it? Oh, I also like a lot of natural remedies, so those books where they talk about essential oils. I'll read those books."
1411.0,1418.0,Interviewer,Natural remedies?
1418.0,1440.0,Subject,"Yeah, because I'm really into scent therapy because there are certain essential oils I'll keep around, like peppermint, lavender, ylang ylang-- is there anything else? I feel like-- oh, cinnamon, frankincense, neroli--"
1440.0,1444.0,Interviewer,"So, you like to keep their oils around?"
1444.0,1452.0,Subject,"And they have the essential oil diffuser, and you can put it on when you go to sleep."
1452.0,1454.0,Interviewer,That's nice.
1454.0,1465.0,Subject,"And I do. And I like it because a lot of times when the wintertime, if you're out in the cold too long, you can get congested. I'll put the peppermint one in there, and it just opens you up."
1465.0,1479.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. That's nice. Do the smells ever get in each other's way? Or do you have them all--"
1479.0,1502.0,Subject,"No, because I'm not too fond of mixing because I'll have them for certain things. For instance, if I feel congested, it'll be peppermint. For sleeping, I like lavender. For after cleaning, I like lemongrass. So, I'm not really too into mixing for that very reason."
1502.0,1508.0,Interviewer,You like to have just one diffusing at a time.
1508.0,1515.0,Subject,"And I feel like a lot of them, that they're cleansing too, cleaning the air and all that."
1515.0,1518.0,Interviewer,A lot of them you feel like clean the air sort of?
1518.0,1546.0,Subject,"Yeah, I found I do use a lot of natural stuff, now that I'm talking about it aloud, because for cleaning the mirrors, I'll use apple cider vinegar. And I'll use it with a newspaper instead of a sponge or a towel, so there are no streaks."
1546.0,1550.0,Interviewer,"Ah, interesting. So, a newspaper keeps the--"
1550.0,1566.0,Subject,"Just the streaks away. And I'll use baking soda. Baking soda is good for teeth whitening. Baking soda is good for cleaning the bathroom. Oh, I do like raw honey facials."
1566.0,1568.0,Interviewer,Oh wow. Raw honey facials.
1568.0,1577.0,Subject,It tones the skin and it gives it an even complexion and draws in moisture. It hydrates.
1577.0,1588.0,Interviewer,"Interesting. And it smells nice afterwards, right? And during, I suppose [laughter]."
1588.0,1593.0,Subject,Is that it? Is there anything else?
1593.0,1602.0,Interviewer,"So, you have a lot of ideas or a lot of different ways that you do natural stuff in your life."
1602.0,1616.0,Subject,Because I think it's important for our environment too. Because I feel like a lot of what we need is right here in nature.
1616.0,1621.0,Interviewer,"Seems like maybe our society has lost track of that or something, huh?"
1621.0,1657.0,Subject,"I do. I think so. Let's see. What else do I have? I would say I'm a moderate shopper when I go to the stores, but I do always say ""I'm happy that the clothes don't have ears."" Because if they could hear what I said about some of them, because I know sometimes I can go in the store and I'll be on the regular and I'll say, ""No, no, no."" [laughter]"
1657.0,1660.0,Interviewer,"Because if they did have ears, it would hurt their feelings [laughter]?"
1660.0,1705.0,Subject,"But I guess they say it's different for men and women in the way we shop because-- I know that literally, say for like a Macy's or whatever, just looking at stuff and trying stuff on, I literally can spend a whole day there. I remember-- what was it-- it was one time. I forget the name of the mall, but it's one mall in Florida. I went and it was like the whole day, I was just in one part of the Macy's, the clothes part. And I didn't even get to see the rest of the mall. But they say men, they just focus and they know what they're going to, like a shirt is a shirt. They don't really go to browse."
1705.0,1709.0,Interviewer,And you feel like that's true?
1709.0,1741.0,Subject,"I do. But I guess my process is: I'll go and I'll browse and I'll see stuff that I like. And I go to the dressing room and then I try it on. And if I don't like it, then it just goes back and that's it. But then if I like it, then I have to stand in the mirror and I have to look at it and then I have to think about where I would go in that outfit and how it would be. And I do that for each outfit. So, maybe that's where my time goes."
1741.0,1747.0,Interviewer,Yeah. If you have a bunch of different pieces and you're trying to put outfits together right there? Wow.
1747.0,1762.0,Subject,"And then I think about, so say, I was at the theater or I was at the mall or I was at the movies or I was at the restaurant, in that outfit. I picture myself in those places and I guess that takes up lots of time [laughter]."
1762.0,1767.0,Interviewer,"Have people told you that you take a long time, or you just feel like you do?"
1767.0,1805.0,Subject,"Well, if I go out with male friends and family members, they'll say I take a long time. But honestly, it's not just in the clothing store. I do that if I go to the supermarkets, like a Whole Foods or something. But you know why? Because I'm a big advocate of exploring your store and just seeing what's there. Because I feel that all stores are not created equally and you have to know what's in your store. So, if there is a time where you need to run out and get something quickly, you know where it is."
1805.0,1808.0,Interviewer,There you go. You got to know where stuff is.
1808.0,1814.0,Subject,And I just like being surrounded by the natural stuff too. I will admit that that's it.
1814.0,1819.0,Interviewer,"All right, well, I think we can go ahead and stop there."
1819.0,1822.0,Subject,Okay. I hope it was interesting for you.
