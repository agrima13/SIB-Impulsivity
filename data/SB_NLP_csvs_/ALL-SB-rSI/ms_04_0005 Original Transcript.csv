1.0,7.0,Interviewer,Okay. So we just want to know how things have been going for you lately.
7.0,46.75,Subject,"Like I was mentioning to you a little bit earlier, I just started Fountain House and it's nice. I like all the people there. Volunteer position, but they're teaching me a lot of life skills and things that I enjoy. So I'm happy about that and I've been kind of looking at the employment section of the website just because I don't have a job right now so finances have been a little difficult right now. My parents have been trying to find contractors and stuff because they're trying to fix up the house, and the airport's coming in soon, I think next year or maybe the following year, in maybe 2019."
46.75,47.0,Interviewer,Airport?
47.0,153.0,Subject,"La Guardia. I mean, well, the renovations should be done. It's already the parking lot and everything they have there, but it should be complete probably-- I would say mid-2019. So my parents have been calling contractors and looking for someone to take care of their cement in front of our house. Just so we've been kind of busy with trying to find someone. It's difficult because you have to find someone and then they have to be reliable and come back, [inaudible] kind of a manageable price. And then you have to kind of budget it. So unfortunately my dad's not working right now. He usually does taxes during the tax season. My mom, she's kind of semi-retired right now. She's happy with the decision because she's older. It was way too stressful for her so she's says, ""I need to just walk away from this."" So she's happy with that decision. Well, I think she's still happy with it now. I don't know. She may have some second thoughts about that now, but it was the best for her health. So I mean, she still is having some-- she had hip surgery and she still is having some issues with that, not just pain in her hip, but just pain in her shoulders and back. And so I was actually speaking to Dr. [inaudible], let's say, Wednesday-- Monday morning, actually, I was talking to him about that, and he recommended-- because I was saying it's been so bad that's she's thinking about actually driving out to the Mayo Clinic, one of the Mayo Clinics and see if she can get some attention there."
153.0,154.0,Interviewer,Wow.
154.0,209.0,Subject,"I don't know if she's still going to do that, but I mentioned to him New York Presbyterian and I think Dr. [inaudible] told me New York Presbyterian Hospital special surgery he recommended. And so I don't know. I mentioned it, so I don't know if she's going to consider that. But, yeah, so hopefully-- I mean, she has been taking her ant-inflammatory drugs that have been helping. She takes it usually, daily. But that's been kind of an issue. I mean, for me, my parents have been kind of-- probably a lot to do with the financial situation, have been arguing a lot. So--"
209.0,210.0,Interviewer,With you or with each other?
210.0,232.0,Subject,"No, with each other. Yeah. Not fighting with me, with each other. So everybody's a little tense. I mean, it's good that we went out yesterday and saw a movie and just hung out, just hung out and relaxed. She saw Mama Mia and we saw Mission Impossible, something like that. I don't know if I could do Mama Mia or anything. So--"
232.0,234.0,Interviewer,Different movies. Okay.
234.0,290.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, not [inaudible], but she's seen the first movie and the second movie, whatever, she'll try and [inaudible]. Naturally, I give her credit because when we saw Ant-Man, she didn't actually see the first one because I think I made-- I made her watch Deadpool. I think I made her watch Ant-Man too. I think she saw both of them. Okay. Yeah, so she is kind of up to speed, but recently-- because I hadn't seen the first Ant-Man either. So that's kind of-- it's been [inaudible]. But I'm happy that I found Fountain House so at least I can go out a few times over the week and kind of do something. Hopefully, they can find me some type of work so I can have something where I'm bringing some kind of money in just to kind of help around the house too. And I'd just like to myself. So that's kind of what's been going on."
290.0,294.0,Interviewer,You mentioned Fountain House made you happy. What kinds of things are they're doing there that are making you happy?
294.0,392.0,Subject,"Well, I'm in the unit where it's like gardening and carpentry, so they basically, they deal with maintaining life and just making sure that the lights are all working above them, making sure that-- actually, the first day I went there actually, they actually-- it was really interesting because they have-- we went out and we had [inaudible] top floor, and there was [basil?] and some parsley. And they have the small tomatoes and some pepper-- yeah, some pepper, what I'm saying. I kind of pick them off and just put them in a little-- I guess like a little safe-- a safe little-- and [inaudible]. But it did the job. So and they made-- actually, yeah, one of the leaders there, Megan, she made a salsa with it. And it was not bad. It was really good. So, yeah, we had it downstairs and the area that we were in, they have a sink and they have a bathroom and stuff. So it's like-- but I've been doing just that there and the, like, mopping, just doing other handy things, like packing stuff that I'm sure there are people in the house that appreciate it. But then we have to get a vacuum cleaner. That's one thing we don't have. We have a Dust Buster, but not anything that [crosstalk]."
392.0,394.0,Interviewer,They're expensive now.
394.0,429.0,Subject,"Yeah. Exactly, yeah. And with all the other financial needs, that's not really a pressing issue right now. So that's kind of what's been going on. And I haven't really been as-- I've noticed I haven't been as anxious as I probably was maybe five or six months ago which is a weird thing. I mean, I'm still, in social settings, still kind of anxious. But--"
429.0,432.0,Interviewer,What do you think makes you anxious?
432.0,483.0,Subject,"With me it's always just going out and just how people will view me, how people will view what I say or interpret what I say. Nobody'll understand that if I'm-- I don't want to say understand, but I guess I should say-- understand kind of, but appreciate the fact that I'm really just the most kind of laid back, I'm kind of a fun guy. And some people just look at that as they don't appreciate it, and they maybe take it for weakness. And it's like I don't know. So I mean, it's not like it is with-- I mean, I don't know if it's the same-- if it's usually that way with girls, but I don't know. With guys, I feel like sometimes that's the case. But so that's--"
483.0,486.0,Interviewer,I don't think it happens with girls.
486.0,529.75,Subject,"Not all the time, but so that's kind of what's been going on with me. I'm a little bit frustrated with kind of just looking for work by myself just because-- kind of where to look and how to network and stuff and find LinkedIn, and all that stuff. So that's kind of a-- feel kind of stuck in that regard. I been to job agencies and registered and stuff, and my only-- I actually didn't want it. I think [inaudible] first one and see what it is."
529.75,530.0,Interviewer,What's that?
530.0,606.0,Subject,"It's like they help with finding employment. So like say you're interested maybe in clerical work or you're interested-- whatever, maybe they'll kind of place you-- job place you. So hopefully, that'll help. Unfortunately, they're not really too many around my neighborhood so it's like I kind of have to kind of go out and travel out there. But so just trying to say busy whether it's Fountain House, hanging out. I mean, I should be more anxious. I usually do get-- I mean, I usually do get anxious when I'm not working. But the fact that I am going to Fountain House-- and this is technically like work because I'm interacting with people, I'm working with different [inaudible], so I guess that's-- I'm not reaping the financial benefits of it. But it's [inaudible] in other areas. You never who maybe could recommend something. I look at it like that, networking always this."
606.0,607.0,Interviewer,There you go.
607.0,610.0,Subject,"Yeah. So anyway you can network, that's good. So--"
610.0,614.0,Interviewer,So what kind of people are you meeting?
614.0,651.0,Subject,"Electricians, what's-- well, one that I met today, the one I was working on a light fixture with, he was actually an electrician. But the other people, I'm not really sure what they do. Like one lady, Michelle, she actually has her own business. I didn't really ask what type of business was. I don't know how people about that. I mean--"
651.0,653.0,Interviewer,"Well, I think curiosity is good."
653.0,670.0,Subject,"Yeah, I probably could just ask and say I'm looking for work. But I mean, I haven't seen her today. So maybe if I see her, I might just-- and then there's a couple other people I talk to. They seem like nice people so I'll see."
670.0,671.0,Interviewer,That's awesome.
671.0,676.0,Subject,And see if maybe they could recommend something. That'd be great. So--
676.0,683.0,Interviewer,What do you think you'd do if you could have anything fall into your lap?
683.0,695.0,Subject,"Anything? Like, anything, you mean money? Or just like--?"
695.0,699.0,Interviewer,"No, no, no. What job do you think would make you the happiest?"
699.0,754.0,Subject,"Oh, the happiest, well, actually, that's the thing. For me, I've always, I've worked in retail. I'm okay with that. It's not really where my interest is. I really just, for the most part, I like to-- I'm a creative person so I like to write. I like to listen to music. And I'm not doing none of that so it's hard to stay kind of motivated. [inaudible]. But that's always been thing with me just of-- and I think it applies to a lot of different areas in my life, just the fear of rejection was always a problem that kind of prevents me from doing what I want to do, ultimately, or maybe reaching out to people more than I currently do."
754.0,761.0,Interviewer,"This fear of rejection, you think that stems from something, or is it just something you've always had?"
761.0,784.0,Subject,"I think this is always something I've kind of had. But I haven't [inaudible]-- but I think that as I've gotten a little bit older, by me kind of not really addressing it as I should kind of makes it worse."
784.0,785.0,Interviewer,Addressing it?
785.0,832.75,Subject,"I mean, addressing meaning I never really been open about it. I've kind of laid it-- not laid it. See, I kind of knew it is an issue and a problem, but I just never really spoke about it. I just keep it just quiet. I just kind of [inaudible], but I would hang out people and interact with people that I overcome it. And I'm better. I still, I can talk to people. That's not really an issue. But it's just ultimately kind of getting more than that. Like maintaining more friendships or more relationships and--"
832.75,833.0,Interviewer,Maintaining them?
833.0,925.0,Subject,"Yes, maintaining, not just meeting someone and talking for a day or two. It's beyond that, I mean. So that's kind of been a challenge for me. And that's kind of always been a challenge for me, this kind of how to, once I find a good friend, not knowing how to hold on to them, ever since elementary school, actually. I actually hurt a really good friend of mine when I was in elementary school, we [inaudible]. He got left back, actually, and I kind of stopped talking to him, and I wasn't really kind of there for him and didn't really be good friend. And he kind of needed someone to talk to, confide in. And I kind of just moved on. I think it was like, 8th grade then, and at the time, I [inaudible] couple of people we were hanging out with and kind of just ignore him. And then I went, so I think about a year later, I went back to town, and I talked to him. And it was a thing where it was like he was upset. And he was like-- he wasn't nasty or anything. But he just wasn't like-- it wasn't the same. We had invited him to actually-- my dad actually invited him and said he had Yankee tickets, and he was like, ""Yeah, come along [inaudible]."" [inaudible] he came, and he was just like, ""Yeah, yeah."" And then just kind of fell through. So--"
925.0,926.0,Interviewer,"Oh, no."
926.0,959.0,Subject,"The good news is with social media and everything, Facebook, I did reach out to him. And I listed him as a friend and he added me. And we talked a little, and explained my situation, what was going on, for a long time, dealing with depression, even right now. I was just didn't- when I was younger, I was going through a lot, so I was really just kind of angry, angry at everyone, angry."
959.0,960.0,Interviewer,Angry?
960.0,1020.0,Subject,"Just angry at my parents, myself for letting that happen. I'd have outbursts where I would just curse, redirect my anger onto this kind of-- to many people, my family, my [inaudible]. My parents didn't understand why. Just they knew I kind of was-- I mean, I don't know if they knew that I was that unhappy because I never really talk that much. I never really tell them about it, and so there hasn't really been a real positive way of knowing. I mean, I did try out for the basketball team when I first went to high school, and I didn't make it. And I just kind of gave up after that instead of just trying again and staying with it. And then I got issues with the basketball team. And it was--"
1020.0,1022.0,Interviewer,"Issues, like what?"
1022.0,1104.0,Subject,"Like physical [inaudible], and it was just, once I left that school, I still had issues. And I thought high school was a really difficult time for me because I always just felt like-- and maybe due to the fact that I went to an all-boys school, high school. So there was always guys flexing and stuff. I mean, there would have been problems probably at a co-ed school as well. But I don't know as much though. I mean, I think they would have been more focused on the opposite sex than to really be into all of that. And you know what? My brother actually went to a co-ed high school, and I mean, he doesn't tell me that he had any issues with that. But he was on the football team. He made the football team. And he was close with the football team. I mean, they were maybe other issues as far as-- I mean, him being black and just African American. So there were kind of some underlying racial tension there a little bit. I know my parents kind of felt when they went to a football game to watch his football games."
1104.0,1106.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1106.0,1299.0,Subject,"But he never really talked about it. He just kind of-- he just kind of, I guess, went with it and I don't know, did well with it, played on the football. He seemed happy. Unfortunately, he tore his ACL. So he said, ""I don't know if football's really--"" because that's a really bad injury. So he said he's not-- but I mean, it wasn't worth pursuing after that. But he got friends at college, and actually, a couple of the kids that he went to high school were playing in his college. And I was in Queens College then too. And [inaudible] few months, I have to say. I mean, seemed like we were, at first, going to try and kind of maintain a relationship, but there was always that kind of distance, and they eventually did their own thing and kind of on their own. And [inaudible], my brother had me at the time, until I stopped. And then he had other friends there that he'd made at [inaudible] High School. So it was kind of [inaudible] that. So graduated, and it was big, big fun. But me, I'm still like-- I have some issues. So just this, like I'm saying, maintaining friendships, and then just-- I've always had-- being able to focus and concentrate is difficult for me. So when I get a job, I think that's a big reason why I seeked out Fountain House because they kind of understand my limitations and they have a great-- they have different types of employment there, which are transitional. Then they have, I think, supported, and then I think just regular employment. So basically, I'm not positive what is the difference between supported and transition. I know transitional is, I think that over a period of time-- and I think that's the difference between that and supported. What I think it's-- they kind of guide you for a six-month period if it's transitional employment. But I think with supported, it's maybe a shorter period of time. So it may be like, maybe half of that time, so maybe a few months. Which is still, I mean, [inaudible]. So I mean, that's another thing that I was excited about going in. Because I would always have these problems where I would get a job, find a job, get a job. And then seems like everything's [inaudible], and then there's maybe some-- maybe I lose focus, or I just kind of don't care and-- I mean, I don't want to say I don't care, but it gets boring to me so I kind of lose interest in it quickly. And--"
1299.0,1302.0,Interviewer,So what kind of things have you found boring?
1302.0,1369.0,Subject,"Most of the jobs I've-- like clerical, like filing and copying and-- the first maybe couple of months are okay. Maybe for a little bit, and then it's like eh. I mean, after a while, I mean, [inaudible]-- I mean, it's just like-- I mean it's nice, but if you're not kind of doing something you're interested in, for the most part it's like eh. And I think that's kind of-- not even realizing that that's probably what's happening to me all the time. It's almost like I'm sabotaging myself. So it's like when, in school, I was pretty much the same [inaudible] just sitting down and being able to read a textbook, or sitting down and just be able to read my notes and just be focused. And just my mind is wondering. And I was on-- I've been on medication for a long time. But still, there's always kind of been that problem. So--"
1369.0,1375.0,Interviewer,"So what kinds of things did your mind wander to, or even now?"
1375.0,1413.0,Subject,"Just [crosstalk], but it was just-- I know. Maybe just wander towards-- not any specific profession, but just maybe towards maybe music or maybe towards a song I heard the previous day or something, just kind of wander. And it's always some kind of more towards, I guess, the creative side of my thinking and the creative side of my-- the creative side of me. So [crosstalk]--"
1413.0,1420.0,Interviewer,That's the second time you've brought up your creative side. What do you do with that creative side? Or what would you do?
1420.0,1442.0,Subject,"I mean, I think that I could seriously just start my own website and start writing and just go from there. And just--"
1442.0,1443.0,Interviewer,Writing what?
1443.0,1535.0,Subject,"I mean, I can start writing-- I write songs. I could start writing songs in there, and just make sure I just get everything copyrighten and everything. And just kind of, I guess, maybe, I mean-- yeah. I mean, I don't think there would be a problem with doing that. It's just like I was mentioning before, kind of that fear of rejection has always been there for me, but I mean-- now, I've had people say that I'm a good writer and stuff. So it [inaudible], but I need more. I need more. I mean, I don't want to sound like I'm creating attention, but I kind of am. But I guess it's because-- it's not like my parents didn't try and do everything they can for me, and kind of be there all the time. But there's always a-- I've always just felt like I kind of want to be recognized for something that I did that-- and I think everyone in every field wants that. Like there's something that they did well, where they finally do well, and they just want to be appreciated for it. I think that's just human nature, I think. And more so probably for me because I have been always going through constant rejection."
1535.0,1536.0,Interviewer,Hmm?
1536.0,1549.0,Subject,"I mean, I don't want to say-- I mean, I look at them kind of as that, just not being accepted. I shouldn't say, maybe, rejection, but well, maybe I am--"
1549.0,1550.0,Interviewer,"Well, you're [crosstalk]."
1550.0,1634.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, but and because of that maybe, maybe that's always the reason why I'm always kind of looking for just-- even from my close-knit friends, I'm always kind of, I mean, I'm always looking for kind of them to reach out to me, to text me and say, ""What's going on?"" And for them to be more close to me. But I have to realize, too, that I have to be open to reaching out to them as well, contacting them. And it's not like when I told you about my friend in elementary school. I mean, I didn't do it purposely. It's just like I just, because maybe I didn't have enough friends, I didn't really know how to be a good friend. So and that's still kind of an issue. I don't have a ton of friends. I don't [inaudible]. So it's all kind of new for me. Like how to just even, in a social setting, what to do. If I go to a bar or whatever, I usually talk to some people there, but--"
1634.0,1635.0,Interviewer,New people?
1635.0,1647.0,Subject,"Yeah, talking to people. But I always think, in the back of my mind, I'm always predicting a negative outcome. And--"
1647.0,1650.0,Interviewer,So you think this is related to your past. Okay.
1650.0,1663.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. I think because of the negative reaction that I've gotten in the past, that that kind of stays with me now. So--"
1663.0,1665.0,Interviewer,What kind of negative reaction?
1665.0,1736.0,Subject,"I mean like-- I shouldn't say negative reaction. I should say just not-- well, I looked at it negative just because if I'm not interacting with someone, maintaining a relationship with someone that I may be interested in, whether it's a guy or a girl, I kind of look at it as not really as a positive experience for me. I think that anyone that you kind of enjoy spending time with, they would kind of want to spend time with you. So if that doesn't kind of happen for me, it's like I look at it, and I'm a little-- and because of maybe that bad experience, it prevents me from kind of putting myself out there and developing new relationships, if that makes sense."
1736.0,1742.0,Interviewer,"Well, it seems like you have a close group of friends that you hang out with."
1742.0,1762.0,Subject,"I do, but I think my thing is I always now, I fall into a habit of kind of wanting people to be like me. And have some of the qualities that I have."
1762.0,1763.0,Interviewer,Which qualities?
1763.0,1793.0,Subject,"And whether that's empathy or whether that's just being sincere and just being open to maybe what's going on with them at the time. And when I don't see that it kind of-- I mean, I don't think of them-- I mean, they're my friends, but I don't know if I can be as close to them as I want to be just because of that. And--"
1793.0,1799.0,Interviewer,So what makes those qualities so important to you?
1799.0,1883.0,Subject,"I think because I feel if you-- like empathy for one, I feel if you really care about someone, you help someone. Say maybe if someone got into a car accident. You pick up the phone and contact maybe whoever's close with them, maybe their roommate or maybe their parents, and say, ""Hey, what's going on? Is she okay, or be okay?"" Or maybe go to the hospital or not even go to the hospital. If you're afraid to go to the hospital, send a card. But if something like that doesn't happen, then to me, it's like ""Eh, you couldn't have--?"" And it's not going to take long to do something like that, things like that. And I mean, that's supposedly something I would do. Now along the lines of being kind of open and sincere, I realize that I can't, like I was saying earlier, I can't really expect people to be too open and disclose too much information when I kind of don't really disclose too much information for whatever my reason. But I know I shouldn't be, but it still bothers me. So I don't feel like I should always have to make the effort. I feel like sometimes people should make the effort."
1883.0,1885.0,Interviewer,That's fair.
1885.0,1894.0,Subject,"And it's just like, it's a little draining sometimes. It's like--"
1894.0,1896.0,Interviewer,Draining?
1896.0,1916.0,Subject,"I mean, just feeling like I have to make a good impression or I have to text someone, or I have to impress someone, or I have to put on a show when I go to a bar, to be the person that's confident and talking and drinking and hanging out. It's like--"
1916.0,1918.0,Interviewer,Exhausting.
1918.0,1933.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's like, ""Oh, man."" It's like I don't-- and I don't mind doing it sometimes. But sometimes it's like, wow. And that's kind of where my head is at with it."
