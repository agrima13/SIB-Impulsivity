1.0,9.0,Interviewer,Why don't we start with how things have been going for you lately?
9.0,24.0,Subject,"I want to say bad, but I want to say good, but it's not going too good so to speak, Yeah, So I'm not really a big talker"
24.0,34.0,Interviewer,Okay. What do you mean things haven't been going really good? Can you give me an example?
34.0,61.0,Subject,"Every time I would leave the house I would have these experiences which feels like there's all eyes on me. It makes me really uncomfortable because I don't know what to do. So that's why I don't really like leaving the house, per se, but if I have to do something important, then I have to push myself to go outside"
61.0,71.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What does the uncomfortable feeling-- what does it feel like?
71.0,99.0,Subject,"I don't know. It's like I just feel like people are just judging me for some reason or I don't know how I act in public, but I don't act out in public. I just try to get to point A and point B, but yet I just notice people get uncomfortable, and I don't know why. I don't know if it's something that I'm doing, but I don't know."
99.0,103.0,Interviewer,Why do you think they feel uncomfortable? What makes you think that?
103.0,141.0,Subject,"Because for one, it might be a coincidence but if I'm walking that way and then somebody's walking up the opposite way. it's like I would feel like somebody's looking at me so. When I get off my phone because I'm mostly on my phone in the [ar?]. It's like they would stare and then they would go on their phone, and as soon as I get walked past, they would get off their phone, or they would cross the street. And at first I thought it was a coincidence, but this is happening more than once. I don't know. So yeah."
141.0,150.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That is weird. What kinds of things do you do on your phone in those instances?
150.0,164.0,Subject,"Go on maps. Look at photos I guess, books, anything to just not see that [side of the world?]."
164.0,173.0,Interviewer,Do you have any favorites? Tell me a little bit about maps.
173.0,211.0,Subject,"I just guess in North America, the Central America [inaudible]. I like places where I would like to travel to see the landscapes and see different stuff that makes me happy so to speak, but recently it hasn't really been working so. I try to find different things to occupy my mind or places go on games or read books. But I just still feel uncomfortable so it hasn't been working out."
211.0,218.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I can understand that. You mentioned landscapes made you happy.
218.0,220.0,Subject,"Yeah, I would--"
220.0,221.0,Interviewer,Sorry?
221.0,222.0,Subject,I would say it makes me happy.
222.0,223.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
223.0,224.0,Subject,Yeah.
224.0,229.0,Interviewer,What do you think about [Atlantis?] makes you happy?
229.0,245.0,Subject,"I want to say how it came to be as in how it formed that way, why is it like that, and different people's perceptions of how it looks. Yeah."
245.0,253.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, for sure. Have you seen anything in person that's been like that?"
253.0,260.0,Subject,Not really but I would like to when I get better.
260.0,264.0,Interviewer,So what is on your list to see?
264.0,266.0,Subject,Just in general or?
266.0,267.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
267.0,285.0,Subject,"I want to go to Japan. I also want to go just random places, thinking about just getting a big map and just choosing a place and go. But I don't have the money and resources yet so this is all in my head."
285.0,290.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, for now. What draws you to Japan?"
290.0,315.0,Subject,"I don't know. I always liked it. I always had a-- yeah. I always liked it I guess. I watch a lot of anime since I was young so. I don't know. I guess the culture, the whole politeness, just like the whole sense of safety. I like it."
315.0,316.0,Interviewer,Safety?
316.0,328.0,Subject,Yeah. They have this thing like you have to be polite. It's like you can just leave a bag out in public and nobody will steal it. It's really nice.
328.0,331.0,Interviewer,That's awesome. I didn't know that about Japan.
331.0,347.0,Subject,"Yeah, and I want to go-- that's one of the main reasons I want to go. I also want to live there for a couple months, see if I could change my perception of the world."
347.0,352.0,Interviewer,How would you think Japan would change your perception?
352.0,357.0,Subject,"I guess the mountains, Mount Fuji and stuff, other places."
357.0,359.0,Interviewer,Mount Fuji. I've never heard of that.
359.0,376.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's a big mountain with cherry blossoms around. It's really nice, and I don't know. When I think of Japan, I just think calmness, just like my safety so to speak."
376.0,378.0,Interviewer,And you don't feel that way here?
378.0,396.0,Subject,"New York? No, not really. No. It's really hard to when there's a lot of people. Well, it's crowded in Japan too, but there's a lot of people here that makes me just feel uncomfortable so to speak. I guess it's how I was brought up but."
396.0,399.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by that?
399.0,417.0,Subject,"Well, I live in [Bed Stuy?] so in the 90s growing up it was really dangerous. So you always have to watch your back for anything and just mind your business unless you want something to happen to you. So, yeah."
417.0,419.0,Interviewer,Okay. So Japan is nothing like that?
419.0,422.0,Subject,Yeah. It's really safe.
422.0,434.0,Interviewer,Cool. Cool. So you've seen or read a lot of anime?
434.0,436.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
436.0,443.0,Interviewer,Can you tell me about your favorites? I've never actually encountered anime so.
443.0,491.0,Subject,"Okay. I like this one called One Piece. It's about a whole voyage of they're trying to find the-- a treasure. All the pirates are trying to find a treasure. but it's really hard to find. There's a lot of foreshadowing and small details that if you miss it, it's gonna bring up-- pop up again in the future. And it makes you think, ""Oh wow. I've noticed this before."" That's about the only thing I watch. I guess Naruto is good. I like animes that make you think, makes you change your perception on a lot of things, make you see-- think outside the box so."
491.0,493.0,Interviewer,Outside the box?
493.0,512.0,Subject,"Yeah. She sees something normal. Yeah. They'll seem normal, but if you see somebody do an action and the first instance you think, ""Oh, he did that action."" But not why he did it or how he's feeling in that type of situation. And would you do the same?"
512.0,521.0,Interviewer,"Cool. Cool. So do you read any anime, or is it mostly watching?"
521.0,521.75,Subject,I read it too.
521.75,522.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
522.0,530.0,Subject,"Yeah. I used to read one piece also, but I read different genres and stuff."
530.0,533.0,Interviewer,Are they different at all?
533.0,545.0,Subject,"Kind of but they still have the same premise, but all in all, it's kind of different -different stories, different character development, and stuff."
545.0,552.0,Interviewer,It sounds like you're very knowledgeable about character development. Those are terms for experts.
552.0,569.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah.When I see a character [or anybody?], you start thinking their story. What happened in the past that made them be that person that they are today? It's just what I used to do. I still do."
569.0,570.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
570.0,571.0,Subject,Yeah.
571.0,575.0,Interviewer,What have you been thinking about in terms of your own life like that?
575.0,576.0,Subject,My own life?
576.0,582.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How do you think your past points to your here and now?
582.0,623.0,Subject,"Well, I guess I wouldn't say I had a good childhood. but there were sometimes when I was happy. But I guess I was a sickly child since I was really young. So I never really had a childhood growing up, and I've never really been sociable because I never really got the point of socializing. I see people socializing, and I'm just like, ""Do we really need to socialize?"" And that really shaped me today because I guess I wouldn't say I'm having trouble socializing, but just I try to avoid it because it makes me uncomfortable. So that's about the main thing."
623.0,631.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So as a kid, did you also not like to socialize?"
631.0,641.0,Subject,"Yeah. I never really did, but somehow people would still talk to me, still try to be my friend in a way and--"
641.0,642.0,Interviewer,Really?
642.0,659.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's really weird, and it happened in high school too. Well, I try to keep to myself but yet still people would just come up and try to talk to me and, yeah. Colleges not so much, but, yeah."
659.0,664.0,Interviewer,So do you like it better?
664.0,684.75,Subject,"I guess because when you have friends, you get leave-- well, for me, I get to leave my comfort zone and like try some new things and try to talk because I'm not really a big person at socializing talk. I've never really been that way, but I guess it's nice."
684.75,685.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
685.0,687.0,Subject,Yeah.
687.0,689.0,Interviewer,What's nice about it?
689.0,709.0,Subject,I don't know. I guess it's nice about people actually wanting to see you or talk to you and not being so secluded all the time. And I guess it's nice you can talk to somebody about your feelings or what's going on. Yeah. That's what I like about it the most.
709.0,713.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what kinds of things do you tell people?
713.0,753.0,Subject,"Well, I just tell them what I'm thinking most of the time because I just-- I think a lot and these random thoughts too, but when I have weird thoughts of just do you think aliens exist or stuff like that. Then I always try to talk to them and see their opinion on it and see how they see it. Or I see a sign and just like it could be a word, I would see how they would see it on the sign, what it means to them stuff like that."
753.0,758.0,Interviewer,Cool. So can you give me an example of something you talked to someone about recently?
758.0,792.0,Subject,"Oh, well, there's this word like awge, it's like A-W-G-E, Yeah. It's something I guess in with the rap scene and people-- nobody really knows what the meaning of it is because that's what they tell you. The first rule is not to discuss what it means so try to see it. I talked to my friend about what he thinks it means. Why it means that, and why so secretive?"
792.0,795.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Why do you think it's so secretive?
795.0,800.0,Subject,"I don't know. I guess it's just you have to know to know, I guess."
800.0,802.0,Interviewer,You have to be an insider?
802.0,804.0,Subject,"Yeah, basically."
804.0,808.0,Interviewer,Do you have any hypothesis?
808.0,847.0,Subject,"I don't know. I guess it means in a way be yourself so to speak because do we have-- they would say the word. It's like they would do something and then they would say it. Do we have a little freestyle and at the end, they would say it. And in the freestyle they would just talk about themselves, I guess and just talk about the experiences and I'm guessing it's about what shaped them, the experiences of their past and what made them to this point today so to speak so."
847.0,856.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I'll keep that in mind. Is the rap scene something that you follow closely?
856.0,857.0,Subject,Yeah. I like rap music.
857.0,859.0,Interviewer,Yeah? What about it?
859.0,893.0,Subject,"I don't know. I guess the beats, the instrumentals. Sometimes they can be repetitive and kind of violent. but I tend to stay away towards most of that and just hear about their story. Because what I kind of noticed is you wouldn't want to release a song that you wouldn't feel comfortable with. So they have to feel comfortable with something or there has to be hidden messages in the song for them to actually understand it so."
893.0,894.0,Interviewer,Hidden messages?
894.0,916.0,Subject,"Yeah. For instance, somebody could be like-- have a really nice song, a really hype song, but throughout the messages it could be a hidden one that's desperation or a call out for help in a way. I noticed that in a couple of songs [crosstalk]."
916.0,918.0,Interviewer,Which ones?
918.0,919.0,Subject,You ever heard of Lil Peep?
919.0,920.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
920.0,928.0,Subject,"Yeah, some of his songs. Somebody named [Wifi Shrew?]. A lot of rappers like that."
928.0,932.0,Interviewer,So what are these messages? What are they saying?
932.0,950.0,Subject,"It's like a I guess a cry out for help, but they're-- I guess they're too afraid to actually be like, ""Hey, I need help."" So I guess people try to pick up on that or they wish people would pick up on that to, I guess, help reach out to them. That's what I noticed."
950.0,959.0,Interviewer,What kinds of words do they use to ask for help? What are you hearing that--
959.0,988.0,Subject,"Grim. Somebody like a rapper said like ""Tell my momma that Grim got my back."" People would think that it's [inaudible]. You don't really [inclem?] I guess, that word. You associate it with darkness and dark times, and he would say that has his back then somethings honestly wrong so. Stuff like that"
988.0,991.0,Interviewer,I guess if darkness has your back you're--
991.0,991.75,Subject,--you're not--
991.75,992.0,Interviewer,--in trouble.
992.0,994.0,Subject,Yeah.
994.0,1011.0,Interviewer,Huh. Interesting. It seems like you're interested in how people's pasts affect their current situations. What do you think-- is there a reason you think that's true?
1011.0,1041.0,Subject,"Not really a reason just that based on my understanding, me growing up, I don't really know who I am as a person. So it just nice to see people and their personalities and see why they are that certain way. And if we have similar experiences, why am I acting this way and they're acting completely different? And, yeah."
1041.0,1044.0,Interviewer,So you think you don't know who you are as a person?
1044.0,1086.0,Subject,"I don't know. I want to do a lot of things but coming from a person who's like, ""Do I like this? Do I like that?"" I don't really know who I am because I never really got a chance to actually sit down and think because I've been in and out of the hospital since I was young. And to be honest, I thought I was going to die at a really young age. So when I passed that age, it's like what's next? I don't really know what to do so. I just been living life I guess just like in a street way I guess, stuff handed to me, other stuff like that. So I don't--"
1086.0,1087.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
1087.0,1127.75,Subject,"For instance, colleges,college-- the college that I'm at right now I didn't really I guess want to go, but that was the only college at the time that wanted me. So I just went and I took it. Same thing with high school. I didn't get sent to the high school I wanted so I just went with it. They asked me if I wanted to join a wrestling team.I didn't really think about it. I just went with it. I just been going with a lot of stuff, and I guess that also makes me become a yes man. You know what i mean? It's really hard for me to say no even when I say no, I just feel bad for some reason. It makes me feel guilty."
1127.75,1128.0,Interviewer,Guilty?
1128.0,1145.0,Subject,"Yeah. This is me. I can't really say no. It's been like that for a while. So I've been just trying to get out of my comfort zone and say no more, but I still feel kind of bad. So I just leave it alone."
1145.0,1149.0,Interviewer,Has there been something recently that you said no to that you feel bad about?
1149.0,1177.75,Subject,"My friend went to go to a concert and I was just like I didn't want to go because there was too many people and too many people still makes me uncomfortable. So I said, ""No."" And they say they're fine and it's all good, but sometimes I think. ""Is it really good? Is it really fine?"" And it makes me feel bad because I guess I notice their whole demeanor changed, their whole personality just--"
1177.75,1178.0,Interviewer,Really?
1178.0,1189.0,Subject,"Yeah. And it's happening to a lot-- well, I noticed that. I've been really good at picking up hints."
1189.0,1190.0,Interviewer,Really?
1190.0,1224.75,Subject,"Yeah. In a way my friend, if he wanted to do something and I was said, ""No. I want to go home."" He just start to change, be quiet and just won't really talk as much. And then if I say, ""Okay. Fine. I'll do it."" Then their whole like-- start to talk a lot and feel better. And that's really getting to me because, yeah, I guess sometimes I feel like I get used a lot too."
1224.75,1225.0,Interviewer,You get what?
1225.0,1239.0,Subject,"I get used a lot just because they see that I say yes to a lot of things and they go with it. They take advantage of that. So I guess, yeah."
1239.0,1243.0,Interviewer,Take advantage and ask you to do things that you don't want to do?
1243.0,1245.0,Subject,"Yeah, and, yeah."
1245.0,1247.0,Interviewer,What kinds of things?
1247.0,1322.0,Subject,"For instance, a couple weeks ago I was at my friend's house and I guess he wanted me to sleepover because his mom wasn't there. And I really didn't want to because I didn't want to be around that whole situation. Plus he had his friends coming over too. I don't want to deal with all that, but for some reason, I still said, ""Yeah."" And throughout that time I wanted to go home, and I was waiting to go home, and then he just kept on asking me to do things. And my first instinct is to always say, ""No, I really don't want to do it."" But yet. I still say, ""Yeah."" And we do one thing, then he do another thing. He make you do another thing. It was like that. So I ended up sleeping over, and it was just really awkward because his whole friends-- all his friends slept over too. And the one time I felt real uncomfortable because just I had that thing where I feel like everybody's watching me, and I really wanted to go home. He kept on trying to drag it to stay later and later, so stuff like that."
1322.0,1324.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] really uncomfy.
1324.0,1328.0,Subject,Yeah.
1328.0,1339.0,Interviewer,Can you remember a time when you said no more? You said yes less?
1339.0,1358.0,Subject,"No. I really can't remember. It also kind of takes me off on a way too because for as long as I can remember I've been like this, and it's not a good thing. It's not."
1358.0,1368.0,Interviewer,Do you have any ideas about why you might be like that?
1368.0,1395.0,Subject,"I don't know. I guess for people's approval. It makes it seem like I might belong there, but that's the only thing that comes to mind. Even recently, I don't want to be around people. That makes me think of myself be totally different, why I'm doing."
1395.0,1398.0,Interviewer,Sorry. What makes you think about?
1398.0,1421.0,Subject,"Even when I'm around people, it makes me feel like even why am I doing certain things? Why am I like this? Is it for approval, or is it just for something else? That's why I have this deep thing for thinking about people. Yeah."
1421.0,1427.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you do think really deeply about. Do you know when that started?
1427.0,1428.0,Subject,Since I was young.
1428.0,1429.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1429.0,1482.0,Subject,"Yeah. I didn't have nothing else to really do, and I noticed the most popular people in elementary school were the ones that were I want to say bullies but they were kind of bullies but they were still sociable, even the people that were getting picked on. If the bully talked to them in a good way, then they would be like, ""Okay. Cool. I guess he's cool."" And then they would kind of form a friendship in a way. And that would only make me think that you were bullied a week ago and all of a sudden you're friends. It makes me feel kind of weird. I guess the fakeness too because in high school people are really fake. They would say hi to you one day. Then the next day, they'd be talking a lot of crap about you, and I'd see that multiple times, and that happened to me too so."
1482.0,1483.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
1483.0,1486.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, just really made me want to shut off."
1486.0,1488.0,Interviewer,Right. I can imagine. What kind of things were they saying?
1488.0,1499.0,Subject,That I'm weird when I  talk to people I guess. I wouldn't say all the [inaudible] bully. They feel like I looked titled which I don't understand why so.
1499.0,1505.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. That's weird. Any ideas?
1505.0,1532.0,Subject,"No, not really. To be honest, I only had like four friends in high school so-- friends that I actually consider friends. So it's really weird to see how other people see me as a person who doesn't talk but only talks to my friends. I guess I expect people to come talk to me instead of me going out talking to other people. I guess that's how they would see it."
1532.0,1535.0,Interviewer,Do you feel like that's accurate?
1535.0,1549.0,Subject,"No, not really. I just simply I just don't want to see people. I just want to be alone, but yet they see me as sort of [inaudible] because when I'm with my friends they talk a lot."
1549.0,1551.0,Interviewer,So you do talk a lot with your friends?
1551.0,1556.0,Subject,"Yeah, just my thoughts, and I have a lot of raging thoughts. That's just talk."
1556.0,1558.0,Interviewer,Raging thoughts.
1558.0,1580.0,Subject,"Not anything bad, just other thoughts that comes out frequently. It's like random thoughts. When I share it I feel better because it gets really quiet. I only like quietness a lot so when I share it, it opens up a door for that conversation and we talk a lot so."
1580.0,1582.0,Interviewer,So that conversation makes you feel better?
1582.0,1583.0,Subject,Yeah.
1583.0,1589.0,Interviewer,Because it's not silent? You like the interaction or you like just kind of [inaudible]?
1589.0,1601.0,Subject,"Just advice, and I'm not really one for small talk. But if I have to talk about something, then I guess I'll do it so."
1601.0,1616.0,Interviewer,"Cool. So you do have a lot of-- I mean, you have friends from high school and stuff. Did they kind of help you through when you were sick? That sounds really scary."
1616.0,1640.0,Subject,"Yeah, but I was mostly beserk about I guess friends that I would tell it to. And they would offer me help, but there's so much you can do with just talking. You could talk about it, but the problem would still be there so. That's how I would say."
1640.0,1645.0,Interviewer,So did you feel like talking helped you that time or not at all?
1645.0,1668.0,Subject,"No. It made me feel worse because, yeah, because when you tell your friends, they're like-- you didn't expect to live so long. What could you say? They look at these things. Well, but you did a good job or what-- it was just like that kind of thing, just was really weird."
1668.0,1669.0,Interviewer,Talking about that at all?
1669.0,1671.0,Subject,Yeah.
1671.0,1672.0,Interviewer,Okay. We don't have to talk about it.
1672.0,1675.0,Subject,No. That's fine.
1675.0,1688.0,Interviewer,"So you made it past this point. You mentioned that it was a little bit odd because you didn't think you'd be here this long. But during that time, how did it feel?"
1688.0,1708.0,Subject,"Weird because after that you get a sense of what's next. You try different things, and you still don't know yourself in a way because people see it. My whole personality changed from before, but I don't see it at all."
1708.0,1710.0,Interviewer,"Well, what do they say?"
1710.0,1730.0,Subject,"I used to be outgoing and fun, I guess, but now I'm just always below me. And I was always like this so I don't know what they were talking about. Yeah. I would have funny moments or fun moments, but even with all that I was still feeling like crap and--"
1730.0,1732.0,Interviewer,Physically or emotionally?
1732.0,1748.0,Subject,"Just both. It's more an emotional thing, and when these thing-- then they'd tell me, ""You kind of changed."" It makes me feel like did I really change? Or why did I change? Stuff like that."
1748.0,1753.0,Interviewer,So you don't feel like you've changed really at all?
1753.0,1778.0,Subject,"No. I've been the same person for a while, and I guess that's kind of making me feel uncomfortable because, yeah, I was going through all those problems before and I was really upset, but things were supposed to get better. I got surgery. Everything was supposed to be fine. Yet I'm still going through all these problems, and it's like what more can I do?"
1778.0,1782.0,Interviewer,So what are the problems you feel like you're still having even after the surgery?
1782.0,1830.0,Subject,"Just it's not a physical thing, just a mental thing. Even sometimes I never really-- I always felt like I was weird, not like call you weird you're doing that for yourself, you're weird. Just I would notice stuff. Even when people were to talk or have answers or something, I would think of something totally different. You see the color blue you would think sadness or whatever, but I would sometimes think I guess happiness in a way because the sky, just other stuff like that, and that's what makes me-- it used to make me question myself too. Why am I so weird?"
1830.0,1832.0,Interviewer,Like why are your answers so bad?
1832.0,1848.0,Subject,"Yeah. And it's been going like that for a while. That's why I can't really, I guess, socialize [inaudible] because I don't want to say anything wrong or say the wrong thing and it makes me feel like-- or make them think that I'm coming off as a creep."
1848.0,1849.0,Interviewer,A creep?
1849.0,1862.0,Subject,"Yeah, just like stuff like [inaudible] is what I think about. I don't want to make people feel uncomfortable or make them feel like I'm a creep or some kind of weirdo because of my answers."
1862.0,1869.0,Interviewer,"That's an interesting word. Instead of odd creep, what do you think would make them think you're a creep?"
1869.0,1898.0,Subject,"I don't know. I just think the answers, but I guess the way how if there were like perception tests-- it's really hard for me to explain really. It's like have you seen 13 Reasons Why?"
1898.0,1901.0,Interviewer,No. Do you recommend it?
1901.0,1940.0,Subject,"It's kind of depressing, but I guess it's fine in a sense you get to see outside your perception or inside perception of people's minds and what they're going through and how people can see them as one person, but they're actually a different person. But I won't release [inaudible] but, yeah. It's like a situation in there where [inaudible] does something. People think you're a creep for doing it, but he has actually another reason for doing it, and it was actually a pretty nice one so."
1940.0,1942.0,Interviewer,Interesting.
1942.0,1943.0,Subject,Yeah.
1943.0,1946.0,Interviewer,So you identify with that?
1946.0,1953.0,Subject,"Not really, but it was like an example, but stuff like that made me like that."
