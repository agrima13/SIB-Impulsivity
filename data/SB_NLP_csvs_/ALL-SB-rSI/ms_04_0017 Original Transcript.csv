0.0,6.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So [inaudible] I just want to ask you, how have things been going for you lately?"
6.0,16.0,Subject,"It has been good and everything is pretty good. From the last time I came, from the first time, it's pretty better now. Yeah."
16.0,20.0,Interviewer,"Oh, great. And what makes it better?"
20.0,25.0,Subject,"So actually, should I start from the latest talk?"
25.0,26.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
26.0,84.0,Subject,"Okay. So I got my master's from West Virginia, Marshall University West Virginia. Okay, so it's like in the movie We Are Marshall, it's based on that university. Yeah. And then I came-- after I got my master's, I came to New York to search for jobs and, obviously, other paperwork and stuff, sponsorship. And then I was struggling for a while. Then I got a job. It was a good experience. Then I got another job, which was much better. And I also got sponsorship. And this is the third job. So it's really good. I'm doing this from January 2019. I mean, everything is pretty much on the right side of things. So, yeah."
84.0,88.0,Interviewer,So what are you doing exactly?
88.0,152.0,Subject,"So I basically got my master's in safety technology. It's a very broad field, as you can see, in here. And I'm a geologist by profession with emphasis on engineering geology, so it's the geotechnical side of engineering, the civil side. So I worked as a civil engineering in New York for, let's say, one and a half years. And then I switched to safety. And I find it much easier in a lot of ways, better, in demand and stuff. And then I got also sponsorship process. So these were the goals I had in my mind, and I'm just-- so that's it."
152.0,153.0,Interviewer,So what is sponsorship?
153.0,174.0,Subject,"Sponsorship is when you came from another country and you have a student visa, then you have to apply for sponsorship. Somebody has to sponsor you, either through employment and through other means. I'm getting it through employment, which is a very good thing. I'm really proud of it."
174.0,175.0,Interviewer,That's great.
175.0,182.0,Subject,Yes. Not many people can achieve this. So it's a competitive environment.
182.0,183.0,Interviewer,"Oh, congratulations."
183.0,185.0,Subject,Yeah. Thank you.
185.0,188.0,Interviewer,That sounds really stressful to navigate before you got it.
188.0,194.0,Subject,"Well, initially it was. And now it's just the opposite. Stress-free. Yeah."
194.0,196.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I guess that makes sense.
196.0,198.0,Subject,I'm too much stress-free here [laughter].
198.0,199.0,Interviewer,Too much?
199.0,200.0,Subject,Yeah. Very.
200.0,202.0,Interviewer,What do you mean?
202.0,292.0,Subject,"I mean, there is no such thing as 9:00 to 5:00 or 7:00 to 3:30. And there is no such thing for me as going to job every day. It's just freedom. Freedom and nobody can tell me, ""Okay, can take this project. Don't take this project."" It's I, who decide my clients and work with them according to what I want. Okay. So this is a license. I get a license from the city department of buildings. They have three kind of licenses to operate as a safety practitioner for construction. So I have the construction superintendent's license. They have certain rules. For example, you have to fill in logs every day. And you have to make sure everything is according to compliance. For example, everybody is safe and the procedures are maintained. For example, if they are using a ladder, it's should be in a certain way. Or are they wearing harnesses while they are more than six feet, and different things."
292.0,293.0,Interviewer,It's a lot to keep track of.
293.0,328.0,Subject,"Well, so this is the thing. I assigned company persons, which is an official designation. I assign them on a paper, [inaudible] to whom it may concern. So every site has a competent person. And if anything goes wrong, they just call me. Apart from that, they are OSHA trained professionals. They must be. So they actually look for the site when I'm not there. So I have multiple sites, up to 10 sites. "
328.0,329.0,Interviewer,10?
329.0,404.0,Subject,"Yeah. So it's kind of managing compliance and also making sure that the building is being made according to the approved plans from the department of building. So I mean, these are the things. Once the project starts off, there is just regular work, fill in logs. So there are three components of building. One is an engineer of record, then architect of record, then the superintendent of record. I'm the superintendent. So I also maintain daily logs for-- I guess, it's just one paper. Okay. What's been done? How many people are there? What's the environment like? The weather like? These kind of things. And what were the problems? It's good, easy. Sometimes I think I should learn more at this age. But I mean, it will come."
404.0,410.0,Interviewer,What kind of things would you be interested in learning?
410.0,495.0,Subject,"Sorry. I don't know. So look, when you come from Marshall's background, it's all 600 level, 500 level courses, more research-based assignments and these kind of things, so-- and then you end up in construction. Okay. You are on top of it pretty much, not top, top. And then you think that, ""Okay, I'm not learning from anybody who I'm working with regularly."" So for example, if I don't stay at a job, if I go there, I check and accompanying person says, ""Okay, everything is good. Nothing has been happening,"" I just sign the log and leave. So, okay, it's management but there is so many other things to learn. And safety is so broad, it's not just construction. It's process safety management and industrial and industry hygiene, quality assurance. It's not just construction. So I'm just looking forward to getting my certified safety professional certification and switching to industrial level because it's more challenging."
495.0,500.0,Interviewer,It's more challenging because it's kind of bigger scale?
500.0,525.0,Subject,"It's on a bigger scale. So this is the thing, for a construction superintendent, we have 10 projects. But they are small-scale projects, for example, ranging from zero up to nine floors. From nine floors and up, there is another person who is a coordinator. That's a different license altogether. And then, from 14 and up, there is a site safety manager."
525.0,527.0,Interviewer,"Oh, I see. Okay."
527.0,570.0,Subject,"Yeah. But they have one project each. They cannot do multiple projects. But again, I mean, once you are in a job where you are pretty much everything and you pretty much decide what time you go, what time you leave, you go or not go, then it's pretty hard to switch to the regular 7:00 to 5:00, 6:00 kind of jobs where you have to open and close your doors literally and be responsible for every aspect. So yeah, I can switch any time, but for now, it's good."
570.0,581.0,Interviewer,"Thanks. Do you remember what kind of made you want to do this, in the first place?"
581.0,652.0,Subject,"Yes. So when I got my graduation, bachelor's, I was doing nothing for five, six months, and then-- because I was trying to get into petroleum industry, oil and gas. My father is an electrical engineer and he works for a huge firm back in Pakistan. He told me that, ""Okay, it's too much. You have to work somewhere now. So let's go for engineering side of geology."" So he gave me an opportunity for interview in his company, and I got selected. I started working for dam-site investigation. It was an Australian firm and then a Pakistani firm merger. So the management consultants were Australian, and that guy said, ""Okay, we need a safety person for the site because it's hard."" And in Pakistan, there was no such concept as safety."
652.0,656.0,Interviewer,Bamboo [inaudible] bamboo scaffolding there.
656.0,751.0,Subject,"Correct. Correct. So I mean, then he said, ""Okay."" So my manager in field operations, he decided that I'll be the safety manager or safety officer for the left bank and [inaudible]. A dam had a left bank and a right bank. So when he was going to the right side, I'll be the safety for the left side and vice versa. And I used to fill in forms and stuff. And then I started being interested in safety. Then my father started business, and he said, ""Okay, I need you. And just come over."" And I said, ""Okay."" We started the business, and it just failed. And then I said, ""Okay, I'm not going back. I'm going outside for a master's."" And he said, ""Okay. Just apply."" And I was applying for Canada, Australia, UK, not US [laughter]. So one of my friends just in my neighborhood, he told me that, ""Okay, I'm applying for the United States. Do you want to go there?"" I said, ""Okay."" So he was applying in engineering management. I said, ""Okay, what else? What are other options?"" He said, ""Okay, there is safety technology."" I said, ""Okay, I'll go there."" So because I just had this in my mind and I thought it's pretty interesting. So I just got my [inaudible]."
751.0,752.0,Interviewer,That's great.
752.0,777.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I applied for petroleum industries here, but Marathon and oil refineries. So, yeah. But they are more security orientated than safety oriented. So if you are not a citizen, it's kind of hard to get in."
777.0,778.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I can imagine.
778.0,780.0,Subject,Yeah. It is. Yeah.
780.0,785.0,Interviewer,"And you said before you were doing this, you had picked geology to study."
785.0,786.0,Subject,Yes.
786.0,790.0,Interviewer,What made you pick geology?
790.0,850.0,Subject,"Because my two cousins that were seniors, let's say, eight to ten years, and they got there through physics from Pakistan. And then they started jobs and earning a lot of money. Okay, money is also important, but they were also having 28-28 days' rotation. So 28 days, they would be on the field, and for 28 days they would just do nothing or just do random things. They would return, they come home and do nothing. So, I don't know, my immediate sister, she is a doctor. My father was telling me, ""Okay, just go become a doctor and--"" I don't know, my cousin told me it's a real diamond field and I want to go there, geology. I want to become a geologist. It's more real-time. And then I just became a geologist."
850.0,856.0,Interviewer,It sounds like you get a lot of advice from your father.
856.0,884.0,Subject,"Yes. Yes. Because I was even-- the friend who came with me, he was kind of a friend from Pakistan, he changed his majors from engineering management to technology management, which is easier to get a job because IT is so much dominated by India and sometimes Pakistan."
884.0,885.0,Interviewer,South Asia.
885.0,902.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. South Asia. So my father said, ""Okay, just keep in safety, just please, get your master's in safety, and you don't need to go."" I said, ""Okay."" All this thing. I mean, it paid off. It's good."
902.0,909.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Seems like it [laughter]. So are you and your father close?
909.0,911.0,Subject,We talk regularly.
911.0,914.0,Interviewer,Okay. Only about work?
914.0,990.0,Subject,"About everything. General, okay, my sister has a son. And so he talks about him. He talks about how he's walking regularly and I should too, which I sometimes do and sometimes-- now things are pretty good. But when I started everything, and from West Virginia, when I came to New York, it was like hell. I mean, it was crazy, literally. I didn't know how would I survive. The housing was difficult. Everything was so expensive. It was crazy, literally. And I just kept working and just kept doing whatever. One of my friends was here with me. He was also in the same, and now he's very well [sided?] too. He has his own business. I mean, things just got so much better in the last two, three years. Yes [laughter]. Yeah. Hard work paid off [laughter]."
990.0,991.0,Interviewer,As it should.
991.0,992.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah."
992.0,1001.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's awesome. So it seems like you're really invested in your work. What do you do outside work?
1001.0,1077.0,Subject,"So I mean, it really depends upon-- I'm not the program or the vacation schedule, program maker of my group. The other friend that is in Connecticut, he generally makes the program and I just stick to it [laughter]. So for example, last week, he said, ""We're going to West Virginia, [inaudible] University."" One of my friends is also a research coordinator in Marshall Health. So we just visit there on weekends. I just came back. And similarly, we do fishing, boating. I went boating and like nature and like skiing and these kind of things. Not very regularly, since everybody is very busy if I'm not. But I mean, we try to do as much as possible. For example, I'm planning to go to a concert in ADC on the 17th. I didn't know. My friend just bought a ticket and he said, ""Okay, just come over."" I said, ""Okay."""
1077.0,1078.0,Interviewer,Nice.
1078.0,1103.0,Subject,"Yeah. So these kind of things. And also different kind of things. Some of my friends, for example, they are juniors in Marshall. They just come to New York. They contact me. I try to help them out for jobs, for housing, if they need car, these kind of things."
1103.0,1115.0,Interviewer,"That's really sweet. And when you go home at the end of the day, what do you like to do, just on a day to day?"
1115.0,1138.0,Subject,"What I like to do, I would imagine to go to gym for three hours. But I don't do it. I have a cycle. Where I'm sitting on my recliner, I have a cycle, an exercise cycle next to me. And I would imagine just doing it for two hours. I did it at one time but I--"
1138.0,1140.0,Interviewer,You don't have time? You don't want to?
1140.0,1141.0,Subject, I have so much time [laughter].
1141.0,1142.0,Interviewer,You do?
1142.0,1144.0,Subject,Yeah.
1144.0,1147.0,Interviewer,And why do think you don't then?
1147.0,1157.0,Subject,I don't know. I try to. I would. I will [laughter]. Fingers crossed.
1157.0,1160.0,Interviewer,So why cycling?
1160.0,1192.0,Subject,"Okay, I used to run for three-- I used to run. And I lost a lot of weight. I was, let's say, 40 pounds lighter than I am now. But then I thought that if I run at this weight, I may damage my knees in the long run. So I just went with the cycle."
1192.0,1196.0,Interviewer,Is exercise something that makes you feel better?
1196.0,1205.0,Subject,"Yes. It does. [inaudible] if I do it, I feel really okay."
1205.0,1207.0,Interviewer,Probably getting started is the hard part.
1207.0,1210.0,Subject,I get started. I'm not consistent.
1210.0,1211.0,Interviewer,I see. Yeah.
1211.0,1218.0,Subject,I can start and I'll do that for one week. Even I have a gym membership [laughter]. I would go there for one week and then I just don't.
1218.0,1220.0,Interviewer,So what do you do instead?
1220.0,1228.0,Subject,Watch TV. Play Xbox.
1228.0,1229.0,Interviewer,What are your favorites?
1229.0,1237.0,Subject,"Currently, I just finished the Assassin's Creed. But I think it's amazing."
1237.0,1238.0,Interviewer,Amazing?
1238.0,1259.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. It's so real-time. The graphics are great. GTA 5 was good. I mean, it's pretty old but I still have the CD and sometimes-- Tekken 7 and these kind of games. FIFA sometimes with my room-mate."
1259.0,1261.0,Interviewer,Fun. 
1261.0,1264.0,Subject,"I mean, I-- sorry."
1264.0,1265.0,Interviewer,"No, no. Not at all."
1265.0,1276.0,Subject,"I also take my car and just visit a friend, have dinner with him or these kind of things."
1276.0,1280.0,Interviewer,Friends. And so it seems like you have a lot of friends too.
1280.0,1311.0,Subject,"I have a lot of social circle. Yeah. Because through the university, those guys, I don't know everybody from the start. But, for example, one of my friends from university would call me, ""Okay, there is a guy who wants to come to New York."" Can I help? And okay, they just come up and then we start going out. I don't know."
1311.0,1315.0,Interviewer,So it seems like you make friends very easily.
1315.0,1332.0,Subject,"When you're helpful to them, then it's easier to get. I mean, friends, yes. But I have a specific other friend circle, and then there's a social circle when you have to attend to."
1332.0,1338.0,Interviewer,So how do you-- do you see yourself as different with those two groups?
1338.0,1339.0,Subject,Yes.
1339.0,1341.0,Interviewer,How so?
1341.0,1373.0,Subject,"I mean, I am much more compromising, much more easy-going myself with the guys I helped or the guys who helped me in the first place when I came here. Because, of course, there was somebody here who helped me in the start. It was a hell, but still, they did whatever they could in the best possible way. And I'm doing the same things pretty much."
1373.0,1382.0,Interviewer,"So this is the second time that it's come up that it was so difficult to come, especially to New York. How?"
1382.0,1490.0,Subject,"So this is the thing. When I came from Pakistan, I landed in New York. My friend was waiting for me. He was my class fellow back in geology. He still lives in Long Island, Dix Hills. He picked me up. I went to his house. It was wonderful. He already got a ticket for me. I visited New York, different places, [inaudible]. And then I went to West Virginia. So I didn't have the real sense of how difficult it is to survive in New York. And then, when you go to West Virginia-- when I went to West Virginia, one of the friends who was in Pakistan with me, he came earlier because he had cousins and he just came to Maryland. So when I came, he already got an apartment. I just went there and I just went to the apartment, really. He sent me there. I just went there. And on the same day, I got a job. There was a career fair in the university and just got a job. And then I didn't wanted-- I never needed a car. My friend had a car when I needed. But I didn't need the car because I had to just walk to the university and walk to my work which was actually the university. So the two years was so easy, I mean, and so much fun. I was elected the president of [inaudible] association, which was a great honor. I mean, these kind of good things happened. I was a GA for the department of geology, which was pretty good. I had an office."
1490.0,1491.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1491.0,1494.0,Subject,"And so yeah, it was pretty good. Like this, pretty much."
1494.0,1499.0,Interviewer,"Great. But then, when you came back here--"
1499.0,1671.0,Subject,"Then, when I came back here, I contacted one of my friends who was living in Long Island. And he actually shifted from Marshall to MIT on the merit of his degree. So he just shifted credit hours. And he was living in Long Island. And it was a nice place. I was initially going to Houston. But I had some picture in my mind that I wouldn't go to New York. But I somehow ended up here. And then, I mean, I came here. Then he referred me to my other friend who was living in Brooklyn and working in Manhattan. He told me, ""Okay, just come here, and we'll do something."" He helped me a lot. A lot. Period. But I mean, it was tough, living in basement, which is illegal [laughter]. It's illegal, yes. Not having good job. And then the job market was so tough. I mean, I didn't have experience for US. Then, after trying a lot, I mean, trying to call people, I got a job. And then it was internship. So they weren't paying me any money, just for the experience. But in two, three months, I got a job where they were paying and it was based on my geotechnical side, civil engineering side.  So from that, I worked on 217 West, the Nordstrom Towers, the biggest [inaudible]. Yeah. Then the Manhattan, they had so amazing projects, all external development projects and the best ones. So I got a really good idea how the construction industry is. I stayed there for about one year. One year, yes. And then, when I got my license-- I got my license immediately, within four, five months of joining that company because I knew this is where I want to be. Because it was highly paid and pretty much doing all the management stuff, not the technical stuff. So I got the license. And then after four, five months I really switched to work, using my license."
1671.0,1681.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And did you find it hard being away from your family?
1681.0,1684.0,Subject,Yes. 
1684.0,1690.0,Interviewer,And what kind of-- in what way did you feel that?
1690.0,1806.0,Subject,"I mean, I grew up with not much problems, no real problems. So my father was an electrical engineer and he was working in one of the best firms. He would work on the big dams projects pretty much and he would-- it was all the time travel, servants, cars, big houses, these kind of things. And then we were good from my family too, from back. We had lands and everything. So there was a very respectable environment I grew in, very good environment. No problems. Everything good, good, good. And then, in West Virginia, everything was good. Then when I came to New York, I felt so crazy. The people were rude [laughter]. Yes. Yes. And I don't know, it was challenging. I didn't knew. There were no guidance. There were not many Indian and Pakistanis in safety. So who was going to guide you? You don't know anybody. So I had to call people while I was working. I had to call different organizations, and they would say, ""Okay, you need this license for this project. You need this license for this position."" When I go to sites, I would talk to the safety people, the company persons, the engineers and stuff.  And I was telling them, ""Okay, these are my credentials. What should I do?"" So I made pretty much my way."
1806.0,1809.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It sounds like you did make your way. You're doing very well now.
1809.0,1814.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. It's really nice. Yeah. I enjoy it, every moment of it."
