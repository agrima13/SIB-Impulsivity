1.0,9.0,Interviewer,Okay. So why don't we start with just how things have been going for you?
9.0,50.0,Subject,"Pretty good. We're doing midterms right now, so. I haven't been stressed. I feel like I was anticipating school to be a lot more stressful than it has been. And I wasn't homesick until this week. And I'm not emotionally homesick. I'm just excited to go home. I'm not sad that I'm not home if that makes sense. But I don't know. I've been okay. I feel like my emotions have been flat for a pretty long time. And--"
50.0,51.0,Interviewer,Flat?
51.0,67.0,Subject,"Yeah. Just like when everyone else is excited, I'm just not as excited. But I'm not like, ""Oh, I'm sad."" I'll just not even pretend that I'm happy, but I just don't have any feelings about what's going on around me, in a way."
67.0,70.0,Interviewer,So what kinds of things are people excited about?
70.0,135.0,Subject,"Well, okay. So for example, yesterday I got concert tickets with two of my friends. And I'm excited, but they're more excited. And I feel like me - what? - maybe two years ago would be really excited. But I'm just not jumping out of my seat to get-- anticipating it. I don't know. It's kind of hard to explain because I'm still going. It's not stopping me from going. But it's just not something I'm like, ""Oh my God, I'm going to go to--"" On the inside at least. I told my mom. I was like, ""I'm going to this concert."" But I don't feel so elated that I'm going. Also, with sad things that happens too. When people are really, really devastated about something, I just don't feel as personally devastated."
135.0,136.0,Interviewer,Personally? Like--
136.0,146.0,Subject,Yeah. I just don't feel sad about the things that other people get sad about.
146.0,152.0,Interviewer,So what kinds of things do you think they're getting sad about?
152.0,184.75,Subject,"I mean, being away from home has really affected everyone because it's all our first times moving and stuff, being away from our families. And I've just not been upset about it. And a lot of my friends have gone through crying and just being upset. I just haven't. But that's just one thing. There's like a million things that-- it's just kind of like everything that everyone has an emotion about, I feel blank, in a way--"
184.75,185.0,Interviewer,Blank.
185.0,215.0,Subject,"--towards the situation. And it's not even like, ""Oh, I just don't relate,"" or-- because I know me two years ago or me a year ago would maybe have a different feeling about it just because I felt really excited about things two years ago. And I don't know what that time span means or anything. I just know that two years ago, I would've been excited about-- I was excited about things and like--"
215.0,216.0,Interviewer,So--
216.0,217.0,Subject,It's really hard to explain. Sorry [laughter].
217.0,222.0,Interviewer,"No. No, no, no. What kind of things would you get excited about before?"
222.0,289.75,Subject,"Well, let's see. Friends, going to see friends or going to parties was really exciting for me. But now I just don't really care. I used to party a lot, a lot, a lot. And since I've moved here, I just haven't gone out. And every time I've gone out, it's just not been exciting and fun for me. And I still go, but I would rather stay in my room or something. Or I used to go to music festivals a lot. And those would be super fun. I would look forward to them. And then the last one I went to was in July, and I just don't even remember any of it because I just remember being there and just feeling like, ""This is the least fun thing that I could be doing right now [laughter]."" And it used to be one of the favorite things that I would do with my friends. And it didn't make me excited, in a way, of like, ""I'm having the best time [laughter]."" And I just haven't had the best time doing anything as of lately."
289.75,290.0,Interviewer,Anything?
290.0,300.0,Subject,"Yeah. But I don't feel sad about it, at the same time. I'm not like, ""Aw, I used to have so much doing this."" I'm just like, ""Okay. I'm just not having any [laughter]--"" Yeah."
300.0,309.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think made you excited about something like a music festival before?
309.0,387.0,Subject,"I don't know. I mean, for one, you're just out with your friends all day for multiple days. Usually, you travel to another city to it. You're away from home at night as well. And there's just an adrenaline you get going to each set, and you get to dress up, and you get to see a lot of people. And we would take drugs, but that didn't make or break my experience. There would days that I wouldn't want to do it just because it's like three or four days that you're just constantly inebriated. It's not really [laughter]-- so yeah. There would be days where in the morning time, I just wouldn't want to do anything. And it wouldn't make my experience any less, but that definitely added to the excitement. And yeah. So I think definitely just the people that I would get to interact with and just going to see the different artists. And being in the crowd is definitely a whole experience in itself. So just stuff like that would make me excited to go."
387.0,393.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So being in the crowd. Can you describe that experience?
393.0,438.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, when I really found this stuff on [laughter], it sort of just like-- everyone around you is having a different perspective of the same person. And it's like you all listen to the same music, and you can just jump around, and it feels like just a huge mass around you, and you're just enveloped in it. And I don't know. It's just feeling everyone's energy around you is really-- it's kind of a rush. It's like, ""Oh my God. Look at everyone else."" But there's definitely times that I've been in the crowd where I'm just like-- everyone else is super excited, and I'm not excited at all [laughter]."
438.0,439.0,Interviewer,Now?
439.0,465.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's really hard to describe what it's like to be in the crowd. But, I mean, when the artist first comes on, usually is this huge-- because the bass is through the floor. So it's just sort of like physically you feel everyone around you, and then you get excited yourself, but."
465.0,471.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Of course. So this concert you're going to in a few days or weeks?
471.0,474.0,Subject,Yeah. It's on the 30th.
474.0,477.0,Interviewer,You don't anticipate having any of that kind of excitement?
477.0,551.0,Subject,"Yeah. Because, I mean, I don't really know what to anticipate now because I went to a concert in the beginning of the semester with my friend who's the same friend I'm going to this concert with, and it was her roommate's birthday. And I wasn't close to them yet because it was one of the first weeks of school. But we went to a concert. And they cried. They had this whole experience. And I kind of just felt like I was there. And it's an artist that I like a lot. And it was last minute, exciting. And I just kind of felt like I was just standing there and not having the same experience as everyone else. So I don't know what to anticipate for the one I'm going to because I am closer to one of the girls now - I'm going with two other people - but when we were buying the tickets, I was kind of like, ""I hope I'm not spending more money to feel like I'm just at a venue."" Yeah. But also, I don't want to not go and then just feel like a shitty friend [laughter]."
551.0,552.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]. Yeah.
552.0,560.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't even be upset about missing out. I think it's sort of like I don't want her to think I don't want to do stuff that she wants to do."
560.0,568.0,Interviewer,That's a really nice [inaudible] [laughter] friend. Do you think she would feel that way if you didn't go?
568.0,595.0,Subject,"I don't think she'd be upset, but she definitely-- and not upset at me, but. Could just be me wanting to please my friend. I don't think she'd be upset. I think she would be sad that I wouldn't be going with her, but I don't think she would unfriend me [laughter]. Hopefully not [laughter]."
595.0,602.0,Interviewer,I doubt it. Okay. And so have you guys been friends for long?
602.0,608.0,Subject,We just became friends in the beginning of the semester. So like two and a half months.
608.0,609.0,Interviewer,Okay. That's--
609.0,613.0,Subject,"And we got here in August, middle of August."
613.0,614.0,Interviewer,Right. For orientation?
614.0,615.0,Subject,Yeah.
615.0,617.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Did you guys meet at orientation?
617.0,619.0,Subject,Yes. We did.
619.0,625.0,Interviewer,And were you instant friends?
625.0,728.0,Subject,"It was kind of a weird situation. So we have the same name, and it's spelled the same. And I met her through-- I was friends with this other kid, and she's French as well. And so when she introduced herself at orientation, she was like, ""My name is Maya. I'm from France."" And then I turned to my friend at the time, and we were like, ""Oh my God. It's us as a person."" And then we kind of just went up to her and started talking to her. And then the three of us started hanging out the next few days. And I definitely felt like they got closer because they both speak French. And I don't know. I feel like they just related to each other more. And I wasn't upset about it. I was like, ""It's the first week of school. Everyone's making new friends."" And so the three of us would hang out, but they definitely would have their own moments while we were hanging out. But it didn't make me upset at all. I was just like, ""Cool. That's awesome."" And then we kind of branched away from the original friend. And then her and I just kind of clicked. We hung out one day. We weren't even that close yet. It was like the fourth day of knowing each other. And I just went up to her room for eight hours and did homework [laughter]. And then after that, we've hung out every single day. We've spent every single day together since I hung out in her room. And I don't really have any other close friends. I know people at school, but she's the only person I actually hang out with. And a lot of people don't think I have friends [laughter] because her name is Maya too, so they think I made her up, and they're like, ""Oh, you're hanging out with Maya again [laughter]?"" And I'm like, ""Yeah."""
728.0,730.0,Interviewer,They think you made her up [laughter]?
730.0,803.0,Subject,"Yeah. And for her as well. People think that she made someone up named Maya because no one ever sees us apart. So when we're in class, we have different classes. We're not with each other. But other than that, we're always together. But people that don't see us outside of class, they're like-- it's mostly people in our classes that are like, ""Do you actually have a friend [laughter]?"" And I'm like, ""Yeah. I do. She's one friend."" But she's the only friend that I consider my good friend at school. But we get along pretty well. We have some similarities that are kind of odd, in a way. I'm from San Francisco, and she was born in Tokyo, but she moved [laughter]-- yeah. She's all over the place. But she moved to San Francisco for a few years when we were like five or six. And when she was facetiming her dad, we're talking, and we ended up finding out she lived in a house that was right next to my school, my elementary school. And he was like, ""You guys probably saw each other."" Because they even considered the school for her."
803.0,804.0,Interviewer,That's crazy.
804.0,838.0,Subject,"And it's a small, small private school. So not a lot of kids were in that [inaudible]. And so we probably interacted. And then we ended up finding out we had one mutual friend. She was an international student from Tokyo, but Maya was friends with her in Paris. And then I was friends with her in San Francisco. And so it was all these weird things. We're like, ""Maybe we are meant to be friends or something."" Yeah. We get along really well. And yeah [laughter]."
838.0,844.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That sounds great. And so you guys aren't taking the same classes?
844.0,846.0,Subject,No. We don't have any classes together.
846.0,850.0,Interviewer,Okay. So what do you do when you're together?
850.0,869.0,Subject,"Okay. So we go to the same-- we got a gym membership. So we go to the gym together. And they have classes. So we'll either just work out during the-- we'll work out during the week, and then on Fridays, they have anti-gravity yoga [laughter]."
869.0,870.0,Interviewer,Wow. What is that?
870.0,944.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's on a hammock. There's hammocks hanging from the ceiling, and then you just use the hammocks to stretch and do inversions, hang upside down and stuff. Yeah. We had never done it before. So we thought it would be kind of funny to go. And then we ended up really liking it. So we go every Friday for that. And we do our homework together usually in her room because I don't like my suitemates that much [laughter]. I don't like to hang out in my room a lot. So I usually hang out in her room. And so we'll do homework. Or we watch a lot of Netflix and YouTube videos because she used to party a lot too, but since we moved here, we both just kind of stopped. And our moms didn't believe us either. Because we were like, ""Yeah. We go to sleep at like 10:30."" They're like, ""No, you don't [laughter]. You guys are going out clubbing."" And we're like, ""We're really not."" And it's kind of funny because it's just like we both used to be really into it, and now-- I don't think she feels sad about it or that she-- because she does want to go out sometimes, but we definitely just stay in a lot at nights and just watch stuff. Or we'll run errands together like grocery shopping and get meals [laughter]."
944.0,950.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's nice. So you live in a suite. Do you have a kitchen to cook in?"
950.0,953.0,Subject,Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
953.0,955.0,Interviewer,But you don't like staying there.
955.0,974.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I'm not really there a lot, to be honest, because I'm usually in her room or I'm out. But yeah. I cook there. I used to cook there a lot more in the beginning of the semester, but now I'm just not really there anymore [laughter]."
974.0,977.0,Interviewer,Is there something in particular about your suitemates that's bothering you?
977.0,1150.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I really like my roommate. We're not really friends in that we don't ever see each other or hang out outside of our room. We literally only see each other [laughter] in our room. She kind of only exists for me in that room, which is really weird, because we sleep in the same room [laughter]. So we get along really well. But our suitemates, in particular, it started with the smell of their room. Yeah. I'm really sensitive to smells. And I just can't [laughter]-- and their room just started smelling really moldy. Really moldy. I thought there was literally a dead body in there. Not even exaggerating [laughter]. And so I emailed our RA, and I was like, ""Could we have a little--"" I don't want to hurt their feelings and say, ""Hey, your room smells bad."" But at a certain point, it's like something really serious is going on in there. So that is the constant thing. And they just don't notice, I guess. Because they also have friends over a lot, a lot of friends over, and they play the music super loud at 2:00 in the morning. And they just have a lot of things that are just opposite of me. They never clean our suite. And I like everything to be very clean. And at first, I was really upset about it. But then I was like, ""Everyone's coming from different backgrounds. And living with people is hard. Whatever."" So I was kind of okay with it. I was like, ""If they're not going to clean, I'll clean. Whatever."" But any time I bring anything up to them, they're like, ""Yeah. Yeah. We'll do it. We'll do it."" It's kind of just like they're all talk, and they never really do anything. And she even asked me to my face. She was like, ""Do you like living with me?"" But all her friends were in the room, so I wasn't going to be like, ""No. You are horrible to live with [laughter]."" So I was just like, ""Yeah. Yeah."" And she's like, ""You can be honest."" And I was like, ""No. That's just not me to call you out in front of all your friends."" If it was just one-on-one, I'd be like, ""Maybe [laughter] you can clean up once in a while [laughter]. Take out the trash."" But I was just like, ""Yeah. It's fine."" But yeah. So it's mostly just their cleaning habits and having 1,000 friends over [laughter]. And you can have friends, whatever, but if it's 2:00 in the morning, maybe don't play music super loud [laughter]. So it's just stuff like that. And apparently, I'm never home for this, but my roommate tells me that one of them has been having sex in the bathroom, which is like, ""Please. We all have to share a bathroom [laughter]."" I don't--"
1150.0,1153.0,Interviewer,Does it never get cleaned by the maintenance crew?
1153.0,1154.0,Subject,No. It's up to us.
1154.0,1155.0,Interviewer,No. It is all you.
1155.0,1161.0,Subject,"Yeah. If no one cleaned, no bathroom would be clean. They come in, and they'll fix things."
1161.0,1162.0,Interviewer,Of course. [crosstalk].
1162.0,1185.0,Subject,"Hair got stuck in the drain. They came in and cleared it. Because that's the other thing. They don't clear the hair. And they dye their hair and cut their hair a lot. Almost every other week. So there's always hair dye all over the bathroom. Our shower curtain is three different colors. Our toilet seat has dye on it. And there's always, always, always hair, just like chopped hair or stray hair [laughter]. [It sucks?]."
1185.0,1187.0,Interviewer,How much hair do they have that [laughter] [crosstalk]?
1187.0,1200.0,Subject,"I know. I'm like, ""Who is cutting your hair like every other week?"" And she started cutting her friend's hair. So I'm just like, ""Okay."" And they put the bleach stuff on the counter where food goes."
1200.0,1201.0,Interviewer,"Oh, like hair bleach."
1201.0,1212.0,Subject,"Yeah. They'll mix the bleach in the little pot thing and then leave it on the counter. And I'm like, ""Maybe don't,"" so."
1212.0,1213.0,Interviewer,I'm not blaming you for [inaudible] [laughter] anymore.
1213.0,1249.0,Subject,"Yeah. So yeah. That's why I'm never really there [laughter]. And I feel bad because I'm going abroad next semester, and I have to leave my roommate. And she's this really small girl and does not like confrontation. It's like she doesn't even want me to confront them about her having sex in the bathroom because she's embarrassed about it, that she heard it. And I was like, ""You don't have to be embarrassed. We use the bathroom too."" But she doesn't want me to do it, so. So yeah. I feel kind of sad leaving her with them."
1249.0,1252.0,Interviewer,Yeah. But you're going abroad?
1252.0,1255.0,Subject,Yes. I am. To Costa Rica.
1255.0,1259.0,Interviewer,Wow. For what [laughter]?
1259.0,1335.0,Subject,"So Eugene Lang is social-justice-based everything. So the program in particular is-- it's based around a social justice internship you would be placed into in Costa Rica. So the first six weeks-- it's for the whole semester. So the first six weeks, we're going to school with everyone else in the program. I think there's like 15 other people from our school. And so we're going to go to school, just do regular school in Costa Rica at a university there. And then we get placed into an internship, and then we all get separated. So we're only going to be-- we have host families, and you might have to switch your host family between the six week and the eight week period. But the eight week period, you literally have no friends that you know unless you make new friends. But you just have your host family and your internship. And you're just on your own for eight weeks. And the people from the program, they're like, ""We're going to come check in on you once for like three minutes just to make sure you're alive."" Because their whole thing is that we're going to really struggle, and it's going to be really hard, and we have to figure it out."
1335.0,1336.0,Interviewer,Struggle?
1336.0,1394.0,Subject,"Yeah. Because the Spanish competency and the whole group is different. Some people are fluent. Some people rated themselves like 1 out of 10. So if you don't-- for example, a big concern was dietary needs. And obviously, in Central American countries, food is love, and if you refuse food-- and the family dynamic. And so someone asked about that. They're like, ""Are we going to get any help on communicating that we don't like certain foods and that we have to have a certain lifestyle?"" And they're like, ""No. That's completely up to you to figure out how to communicate that."" And that's a really big struggle. Because this is the people you have to live with, so you don't want to be disrespectful, obviously. And also, just like not having Wi-Fi. And [laughter] if you're not really good at Spanish, it's going to be really hard to get around probably. So that's one of the struggles. They're like, ""You're going to have to just get through it on your own and figure it out."""
1394.0,1400.0,Interviewer,So it seems like-- I guess in college we called it an immersion. An immersion [inaudible].
1400.0,1407.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I don't know why I didn't say immersion [laughter] in the first place.
1407.0,1410.0,Interviewer,"No, but that sounds really intense."
1410.0,1433.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm kind of terrified. But, I mean, I know when I'm around the language, when everyone-- it gets easier. The first week is really hard when you travel and no one speaks your language. But when you're around it for maybe a-- I feel like the month. Once you get over the hump, it's kind of okay. And I've gotten over the hump in multiple countries, so I'm not that--"
1433.0,1435.0,Interviewer,Wow. So you've already been to other countries [crosstalk].
1435.0,1439.75,Subject,I've never been to Costa Rica. But yeah. I go to Cuba for dance.
1439.75,1440.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. So tell me more about that [laughter]."
1440.0,1524.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. So I actually was a dancer up until like a year ago. Yeah. So I went to a conservatory kind of high school. It was not really a real school. We just had academics in the morning for like two hours, three hours. And then the whole day was training. And I just trained in dance my whole life anyway, but for high school, middle school years was just like training all day. I didn't see my parents a lot. I lived at home. It wasn't a boarding school type of thing. It was just like you're in the studio all day. So the people I was friends with were more people that I was kind of just forced to be friends with, in a way. I didn't have friends outside of dance. I didn't have friend groups outside of dance. It was just like these are my friends, and these are the people I spend 16 hours a day with. So yeah. That's all I've done my whole life. So when I moved here-- or I took a gap year after high school. And then that was sort of a break because I don't know how to do anything else. I've never had a job. I mean, dance was my job. I got paid. But I never--"
1524.0,1525.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you got paid. Wow."
1525.0,1554.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. I've never actually had a job job. So in my gap year, I traveled, and I worked at a golf course. And it was my family's golf course. It was not really [laughter] counting as [laughter] a job because I didn't have to apply for it. That was the one thing I wanted to do in my gap year was not get a job that I had connections for, but all the jobs I got that year were through connections. But then that's life."
1554.0,1557.0,Interviewer,"I promise [laughter], everyone else has the same--"
1557.0,1587.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I was like, ""I want to apply for a job and earn it,"" but then, whatever, it didn't work [laughter]. Yeah. So I took a gap year to just stop training because by the end of my dance life, I was just going because it was my job and I had all these old people to impress. And I wasn't going because I wanted to go anymore. So I wanted to get that feeling back. And--"
1587.0,1595.0,Interviewer,So why do you think you stopped wanting to go?
1595.0,1639.0,Subject,"Because, I mean, when you do something for like 12 to 16-ish hours every day-- and you have to have that mentality of even the days that you would rather do anything else than go, you just have to go, and you have to just pull yourself there. And even if you're in the pits of having a bad day, you still have to go and leave it at the door. Because in the studio, they don't care what your day has been like. They don't care if you had a shitty night or if your mom is fighting with you or if your parents are fighting. If your boyfriend broke up with you, they're like, ""You leave it at the door, and you're here to dance."" So it's really emotionally draining."
1639.0,1641.0,Interviewer,That's a lot of pressure for [crosstalk].
1641.0,1780.0,Subject,"Yeah. Especially, they don't really consider-- I mean, they do consider. But you kind of forget that we're all like 13, 14. And we see friends that we've had in middle school or elementary school on social media too. You see your friends going to parties and your friends having boyfriends and going to dances and going to rallies and regular school events. And you're just like in the studio [laughter]. And then you eat dinner in the car. And then you go to sleep [laughter]. So emotionally, it's really, really tough. I mean, I gained so much from it, but by the end, it's just like-- because you still have all these people that are evaluating you and telling you everything that's wrong just for like six hours straight. And you're in front of a mirror all day, which is tough [laughter]. And your friends also are your competition. So even though they're your friends, another part is they're your only friends, so you can't go off and decompress, basically, with other people because you don't have any other friends. But then at the same time, these are the competitions for the jobs and competition for performances. So it's a really weird dynamic to live in for a really long time. So by the end of it, I was like, ""I don't enjoy coming to the studio anymore because I'm not doing stuff that I want to do."" I love just going to the studio and putting music on and doing my own thing, but especially with ballet, there's just too many rules and too many things to think about that you don't even want to do. So yeah. It was just sort of that whole world I just wanted to not be a part of anymore [laughter]. So that's kind of where I was like, ""I have a choice now because I'm taking a gap year. And I don't have to do this anymore. It's not a burden to anyone else. I'm done."""
1780.0,1785.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And what made you go into that initially?
1785.0,1795.75,Subject,"I mean, I started when I was three. So I didn't quite have [laughter] big choice. I mean, when you're three, you kind of just like--"
1795.75,1796.0,Interviewer,Do it. Yeah.
1796.0,1834.0,Subject,"Yeah [laughter]. And that was sort of what I wanted to gain again was like-- it's so exciting when you're like three and seven, and you're going, and you just get to run around and express yourself. But by the end, it's just rules and standards. Because then you also have like-- we had these things called evals or evaluations where it's twice in a semester block of you just sit with all your teachers, your ballet teacher, your Gyrotonic teacher, your stretch teacher, your--"
1834.0,1835.0,Interviewer,Gyro what?
1835.0,1924.0,Subject,"Gyrotonic. They're machines for dancers. It's kind of like pilates, stretching, and weights. And they're just like machines that-- for example, one of them is you lie on your back, and your legs have straps on them, and there's weights behind you, and there are cables, and it stretches your legs. So it's just like strengthening, but for a dancer body. Yeah. It's like gym, basically [laughter]. So it's all your teachers and your director and your artistic director. And literally, it was a horrible setup. It was in a conference room. And they'd all sit on one side of the table, and you have to sit on the other side. And they would just tell you all of the corrections that you need. And they get personal with it because it's supposed to be-- the whole idea is to evaluate your progress and leave you with set goals for the future. It's supposed to be helpful, but they really attack personally and like, ""You're a really negative cloud."" They told this girl she was a very negative cloud in the studio. And they told another girl, ""Your thighs are really stubby, and you need to get them straightened and lean."" And they just tell you stuff physically, emotionally, how you handle yourself, your etiquette. It's just all these adults just telling you all this stuff [laughter] that you may not even know was an issue, really is not a real-life problem [laughter]."
1924.0,1926.0,Interviewer,How does that feel?
1926.0,1941.0,Subject,"A lot of people cried. And they literally would bring tissues. They would provide tissues. And it's just like if you know we're going to cry, why put us through that when this is literally all we do all day?"
1941.0,1944.0,Interviewer,Did you end up crying from one of them?
1944.0,2035.0,Subject,"I would cry after because I don't like crying in front of people [laughter]. Because you can talk or you don't have to talk if you don't want to. I was pretty lucky in my first half of my whole experience there in that I was kind of a favorite, in a way. Because it was a lot of politics of a lot of kissing up to the director, and she loved getting kissed up to. And I was in her little circle of favorites. So I got really nice ones in the beginning. And then I would hear about really bad ones. And then I slowly started getting negative ones. But by that time, I was in that state of, ""I don't have to do this anymore. This is one of my last years."" It was like the second to last year I was kind of over it [laughter]. So I didn't really let it get to me. But when I would hear about other people-- when I would hear about other people's experiences in their evals, I would be at stress before them even knowing I would have a good one. And then I would hear about other people's, and I would just be like, ""That sucks [laughter]."" But so the evals didn't necessarily affect me negatively until like the end, but it was more of the stuff in the studio, if you just hear a meeting about you."
2035.0,2036.0,Interviewer,About what?
2036.0,2075.0,Subject,"Just about your progress or like, ""Oh, she's gaining weight and--"" Because we would get weighed and measured. And when you're getting fitted for stuff, all your costumes are one size, obviously, because that's your measurements. And then if your measurements change-- if you go in for a fitting and it's like, ""Oh, your leotard is fitting different. We're going to have to do some alterations,"" and it's just so embarrassing. All the other girls are in the room, and you're just like, ""Okay. Cool [laughter]."" So it's that whole world was just something I wanted to-- that was a really long explanation of why I left [laughter]."
2075.0,2077.0,Interviewer,I don't blame you [laughter].
2077.0,2097.0,Subject,"But yeah. So the whole year off, I just took to just do my own thing. There would be days where I just sat in my room. And I didn't want to take a gap year either. It was my parents, actually, that were like, ""You're taking a gap year."""
2097.0,2100.0,Interviewer,Interesting. Why do you think they did that?
2100.0,2180.0,Subject,"I think because they had an outside perspective of my life. Because on the inside, I just like to get things done. I hate wasting time. I hate fluff, dillydally. I'm just like, ""Let's just get this done."" And also, all my friends were getting ready to go to school. And my gap year was up in the air because my parents were like, ""We want it to be your decision."" But it was not [laughter]. But it ended up being the best decision. I'm so happy that I took a year off because I didn't realize how tired I was and how emotionally drained I was and how little experience I had in real life because my whole life was in the studio. Because you think you have a lot of experience from your life because you get to tour and you get to see a bunch of cool things and meet people, go to events and stuff. But it's like you really don't have-- that was a very bubbled world that I was in. But yeah. Seeing my friends go and getting ready for school, I felt left out, but I also was just like, ""They're all going to be so ahead of me in life because I'm taking this gap year. And I'm going to be so behind. I'm already behind."" And then--"
2180.0,2181.0,Interviewer,Do you feel that way now?
2181.0,2313.0,Subject,"No. I feel actually like the gap year was the best possible thing I could've done because I got to travel and I got to learn about myself in a way that I hadn't before. And I don't know. I just feel like there was a whole world that I didn't know about, which is literally real life [laughter], that everyone else has been experiencing. So I'm really happy that I took it. I recommend it to anyone that's considering it because I feel like there's just such-- especially in San Francisco, the schools and everyone's really, really competitive when it comes to school and who has the most extracurriculars and who is on those clubs. It's such a huge competition on who's just accomplished the most. So coming from that was-- even applying to a city college, no one in my immediate group would-- they refused to apply to city colleges. And my brother went to the biggest popular school in San Francisco. And their whole situation, no one even spoke of city college or state schools. And they're just like, ""That's so stupid."" And I hated that I had that mentality too because I was like, ""School is school. We're lucky to even get Ivy as a consideration for us. But to be so ignorant towards school, like, what?"" So I think the whole competition and egos and stuff, I realized none of that matters. And I was so wrapped up in it. So in that year off, I really realized none of it matters. You go where you let yourself go, and everyone's on their own. I'm still kind of dealing with everyone's on their own journey, accepting that."
2313.0,2315.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk] doing?
2315.0,2356.0,Subject,"Sort of letting go of comparing what I've done and what I plan on doing or my confusion on what I want to do to other people and knowing what they want to do. Sort of just comparing my progress with other people's. I've definitely gotten a lot better. Because in dance, your progress is [laughter] your only comparison to everyone else. So I've been working on it doesn't matter what they're up to. They're going to do their own thing, and I just have to do my own thing. So that's just something I've been working on when I say dealing with, just like, ""It's okay. They're going to do their own thing."""
2356.0,2361.75,Interviewer,So you said you had some confusion about whether--
2361.75,2362.0,Subject,What I want to do?
2362.0,2363.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
2363.0,2561.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I was really set on law. A lot of my family members are DAs, so I got to spent a lot of-- spent. Got to spend a lot of [laughter] time in specifically LA because that's the closest to San Francisco where my aunt is the DA. So I got to hang out and just be in her work life a lot. And I really, really liked it. And I think my main motivation was money because, also, another thing, I hate it, but I'm aware of it that I'm very, very motivated by money. And, again, with the San Francisco elite kid competition, it's just like, ""Who can make the most money today?"" Because I grew up media-free like the first seven years of my life. I didn't know what celebrities were. I didn't know that there were famous people. Or I didn't know that money-- the concept of money I didn't know. I didn't get to just watch TV, listen to recorded music. It was just symphony. Live San Francisco Symphony was all I got to listen to. Commercialized toys, I just got wooden toys [laughter]. And it had to do with the school I attended. I went to a Waldorf school. And that was just part of the rules is no media. So whatever, whatever, I just didn't have that. And then once I discovered it when I moved to a public school, I discovered famous people, and I discovered social hierarchies, and I discovered money and capitalism, I fell in love. I was like, ""Oh my God. This is amazing."" And I don't know. I was literally like seven, and I was like, ""Money. Capitalism. Yes."" And I just was so driven by it. So that's what kind of led into law because it was like a joke. I found out my aunt and all her colleagues, they make like $500 an hour. And I was like, ""Okay, guys. Yes [laughter]. This is what I want to do."" And so yeah. They were like, ""Yeah. Come and work with us, and you can see what it's like."" And they were like, ""We're going to be honest with you. If you want to make a lot of money and you want to hate your life, this is the job. But if you don't want to make that much money and kind of like your life, you got to do something else."" And I was like, ""Okay. I'm ready to hate my life [laughter]."" And my mom was like, ""What's going on with you?"" I was like, ""I don't know why I'm so okay with that."" So that was sort of my focus. And literally until my gap year is when I was like, ""Yeah. I'm going to law school. And I'm going to capitalize, unfortunately, but that's from--"" And then I was like, ""Yeah. And I'll move my family out once I make money, and we're not going to be in America."" Because the other half of me just does not like America at all [laughter]. It's a very weird combination happening here. So--"
2561.0,2562.0,Interviewer,Why do you-- oh. Go ahead.
2562.0,2729.0,Subject,"It's okay. That was where I was headed. And I was very set on that. And then my gap year, when I got to travel recreationally and not for work and not for dance, I just got to travel for me by myself and with my older brother, I realized there's so many social justice issues that are wrong with the world, and I got to see them. Because I didn't go on like a Eurotrip. Literally all my friends were on a Eurotrip. Everyone's seen it already. Why are we going here still? I went to Thailand, and I went to Cuba, and I went to Dubai, and I went to Australia. But I went to the really underdeveloped places. And not to be the American coming in and being like, ""Hey, guys."" I just went, and I just stood to the side, stayed out of the way, and I just saw all these things that I was like, ""This is crazy. This is going on at the same time that I'm over here across the world scheming [laughter]."" So my mindset just completely flipped. I still want money, but [laughter] it flipped of I would rather put my energy-- because I had this whole revelation of I'm only here for an unguaranteed amount of time, so why would I waste it doing what all these white men have been doing? And why don't I just do something that could possibly help someone? And I would get to travel, because I really love traveling. That's one of the things that still makes me really happy. And so I was like, ""Why am I doing that when I could do this and help people? Because I'm existing, and that's very high-- the chances of existence, very thin. So I got the chance to exist, so why not spend my time doing something that's actually good and getting to travel?"" So now I'm kind of veering towards bringing social justice. And I have access and resource. And using that to bring it to people that don't have it. And that's kind of where I'm at. But I'm very confused on how I'm going to do that, which is my confusion. Because I can't say like, ""Oh yeah. I'm studying psychology."" I say right now I'm studying social justice. But hopefully, this abroad trip will help me figure out more what I want to do specifically."
2729.0,2733.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Good. You could also do the law, right?"
2733.0,2746.0,Subject,Yes. So law school could still be a thing. And then I could just take that and then bring it to other places. But that's where I'm confused. That's where the confusion is.
2746.0,2747.0,Interviewer,"But you're a first year, right?"
2747.0,2748.0,Subject,Yeah [laughter].
2748.0,2753.0,Interviewer,"[inaudible]. Your exploration time, right? Yeah."
2753.0,2774.0,Subject,"Yes. That's what I'm kind of like-- I'm not putting all of that pressure on the abroad experience, but I'm putting a lot of my stress about it, like, ""It's okay. You're going to go and do international politics for a little. So you can figure that out then."" So I'm like, ""Okay. That's fine."""
2774.0,2776.0,Interviewer,So you have an internship when you go abroad. Do you know what kind of?
2776.0,2903.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, they're all separated by our Spanish competency, to begin with. So if are fluent, you're going to get this group of internships. But they're all social-justice-based. So they've only told us about like two or three of them. One of them is specifically working with women and girls and their rights, which is what I'm interested in because I also belong to a feminist organization that was all about that. So I'm really interested in that one. But I think they also do ones with coffee plantations that they have there because they produce a lot of coffee. So if you don't-- they said this is more for people that don't speak a lot of Spanish because you're just working in the farm and working the production of the coffee. But it's still a social justice issue of ethical production means and stuff. So it's stuff like that. So it's either physically working in the field or working with an organization. I know one of the students that did the program last year. His internship was with the schools. So it was a mobile school organization where they have this little truck, and it goes to neighborhoods that don't have schools nearby, and it just like teaches the kids. And then one of the things he had to deal with was a lot of the kids had really poor home lives, and they would run away from home, and he would be called to go find them. And he was up to like 2:00 in the morning looking for a kid one time. And he's like, ""That's one of the struggles. You might be sent out to the craziest part of Costa Rica to find a kid [laughter] at 2:00 in the morning."" He's like, ""But that only happened to me because I have high--"" He's fluent in Spanish. So he's like, ""That won't happen to you if you're like a 2 out of 10 [laughter], so don't be worried about that. But those are the stuff you're going to have to deal with."" But those are the internship spectrum, I guess. But all social justice, which is what I'm excited about."
