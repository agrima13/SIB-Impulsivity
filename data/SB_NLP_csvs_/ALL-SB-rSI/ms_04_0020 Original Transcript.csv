0.0,5.0,Interviewer,Okay. So the first I'll just ask you is how things are going for you lately.
5.0,52.0,Subject,"Things have been going pretty well. Sorry [laughter]. I'm trying to figure out what to say. Things have been going well. My job has been okay. Work has been a little bit stressful, but now we've hit most of our deadlines. And it feels weird to be boring actually [laughter]. Because now I feel odd to be working without the pressure of tons of deadlines and the boss breathing down the back of my neck. But I'm probably going to just start looking for a new job too. Because I feel like I'm probably not very well paid to do the work I'm doing. So I'm probably going to be heading out and trying to find a new job as a developer elsewhere or try to build up my portfolio a little bit, so I can sort of be [progged?] to a different job."
52.0,55.0,Interviewer,So what do you do now?
55.0,102.0,Subject,"I'm a web developer for a company that does jewelry e-commerce. So they're building [inaudible] custom engagement rings, etc. Me and about four other engineers have been working to build their new website, because the old website was kind of terrible [laughter]. And so we're more or less done with that. We have a couple of new features to implement. But beyond that, it's pretty much good. So now I'm in a position where I feel like I wouldn't feel guilty about leaving the project half done. It's nice. I'm also about to move over to a new back end. I on the front end design side. But I used to do with front end and back end. And we're in the process of moving over to a new back end later that I don't have a lot of knowledge about. And so that forced me to be [sharing?] the front end, which doesn't sound like a lot of fun, so."
102.0,104.0,Interviewer,So what is front end and back end?
104.0,124.0,Subject,"The front end is the user-facing stuff, like the actual website, like the graphics, that sort of thing. And back end is the foundations behind the site, like figuring out how the database is going to work, figuring out how exactly the pages relate to each other, that sort of thing."
124.0,132.0,Interviewer,"Got it. So we have a database here. But what is the database used for a website? You don't store much, do you?"
132.0,190.0,Subject,"You'd be surprised, actually. For example, all of our products are stored in the database. All of our users are stored in the database. And a user isn't necessarily a made when a user creates an account. Whenever someone actually goes to the website, it creates a session for them. And that has to be stored in the users. You have to store each order individually. You have to store each person's customizations to those orders, that sort of thing. But it starts off pretty simple and very easily become a very complicated and a very large project, which is kind of new, in my opinion. I think it's new. Technology-wise, it's pretty easy to handle a lot of the time. But of course, every company has its quirks. And so that's sort of where my [inaudible] iron them out. We have them mostly ironed out now. But in general, it's [laughter]-- yeah, well, you can't actually see me shrugging [laughter]."
190.0,197.0,Interviewer,But you said maybe front end only isn't something you want to do. You do want to be connected to the back end.
197.0,221.0,Subject,"Yes. Because that's a little bit more rewarding in my opinion. Because front end is a lot of styling. It's a lot of getting designs from our design team and implementing them, which is kind of boring to me. And in general, it's a lot nicer to just not have to worry about all of that and just having to worry about the efficiency of how fast their website is, that sort of thing."
221.0,226.0,Interviewer,Very cool. And what brought you to this?
226.0,228.0,Subject,To the study or to work [laughter]?
228.0,231.0,Interviewer,"To work. Both, either, whatever you want."
231.0,238.0,Subject,I guess part of it was that used to work as a research assistant for a natural language processing lab.
238.0,239.0,Interviewer,Whoa.
239.0,252.0,Subject,"Yeah [laughter]. So this is a lot of these-- I didn't do the actual interviews or the transcribing. I got the transcripts. I was the psychologist person on the staff, because I had a psych BA. And so since--"
252.0,254.0,Interviewer,Me too [laughter].
254.0,258.0,Subject,"Hey, high five. Okay. I got to stay still. I got to stay still so [inaudible] high five me. Sorry [laughter]."
258.0,268.0,Interviewer,Okay. I'm sorry. Yeah. So it is a bit of a leap from psych to NLP.
268.0,345.0,Subject,"Well, I kind of have to talk to you in the first place. You got to have a minor in computer science as a psych major and comp-sci minor. And so what happened was that this professor guy, I really liked his classes. He was going a class in natural language processing that I was really interested in. So I took it, and we really liked each other. And he mentioned that his old psychologist kind of left. And so I was like, ""Hey, I'm a psychologist or I will be, technically,"" in a sort of half-assed way, ""at the end of this year when I graduate."" And so after I graduated, I worked there for a year. And that's mostly [inaudible] experimental design and also looking at the transcripts. Because the whole thing was that he wanted to create a therapy box, which were essentially these large [inaudible] so they can have reflexive conversations with elderly people or people who didn't get to talk very much. And so these people would essentially be able to talk to these AIs and sort of have the AI ask, ""So I understand that you went to visit your grandson. How did that make you feel,"" etc. And then they would say, ""Well, it was nice seeing him."" And he was like, ""Oh, so it sounds like it was nice seeing your grandson. Was that a good experience for you,"" something like that. I'm having a hard time actually coming with a random conversation."
345.0,348.0,Interviewer,No [laughter]. It's validation and then next question. Yeah.
348.0,367.0,Subject,"Yeah, basically. And so my job was to look at the transcripts of actual therapy sessions with the de-identified ones, obviously, and to assign various behavioral [quotes?] to them so it would be easier to classify using NLP."
367.0,372.0,Interviewer,So did you do this computationally or was it qualitative first?
372.0,407.0,Subject,It was qualitative first. And then I'd double-check the computational ones. I would do a transcript. Our AI would look at the transcript and do its best. I'd go through it and give it about-- I can't remember the word for it. It's been a long time since I did an NLP stop. But I would go through and check it to-- it was a reinforcement learning AI. So I'd go through and check it using my own transcripts against its.
407.0,412.0,Interviewer,Right. I see. So you were trying to make it smarter. 
412.0,413.0,Subject,"Yeah, basically."
413.0,415.0,Interviewer,Very cool. Did it work?
415.0,429.0,Subject,"Kind of. I left before we got superfine to it, because it was still a pretty new project. But I think he was definitely getting somewhere. He also just got tenure last year. So that was cool."
429.0,442.0,Interviewer,"That is really cool, actually. Tenure is hard to come by these days. So what made you switch out of this more psych research background to web design stuff?"
442.0,467.0,Subject,"Well, for one thing, web development pays a lot more [laughter]. For another thing, I was in Texas. And it was nice. I was living with a bunch of my friends. It was cool. But I felt like I was sort of getting very static. And I feel like I could have just stayed there for a pretty long time, not doing a lot to grow and change or anything. So I kind of wanted to change a little bit, so I didn't get too complacent. So I didn't get to ask what I've become, how my life was going."
467.0,469.0,Interviewer,Who's satisfied?
469.0,495.0,Subject,"You [inaudible] on me. You don't want this sort of not quite-- I felt like I wasn't really growing as person that much when I was staying there. Because it was two years after graduation. I haven't really changed my circumstances very much. I felt like, ""Oh, no. What if I got too happy like this?"" And so I decided to move to New York, try out something completely different. And so I'll just - I don't know - do that. And things worked out."
495.0,503.0,Interviewer,Okay. It sounds like it's worked out. Do you think you're too happy here now?
503.0,534.0,Subject,"No. I'm at least pretty constantly challenged. I've made a different group of friends. I miss my old friends, but I still talk to them a lot. And I visited a couple of times. I feel like in general, it's been like I know that I'm not just going to be satisfied and get stuck in a rut for the next 20 years or something, doing the same thing over and over again. Well, at the very least, it doesn't seem like that now. It seemed like that might be at risk in Texas [laughter]."
534.0,543.0,Interviewer,"It's interesting, this idea of being too happy or satisfied and things being easy. Do those always have to go together? "
543.0,569.0,Subject,"No. But it feels kind of disappointing if I'm not being challenged in some degree. I think that, personally speaking, if I go too long without feeling like, ""Whoa. This is kind of interesting or hard--"" I guess I tend to complete difficulty with-- what's the noun form of interesting [laughter]?"
569.0,570.0,Interviewer,Interest.
570.0,597.0,Subject,"Yeah. Interest isn't' quite the word I'm gunning for. But it seems kind of like difficulty of a subject being interesting, where I’m learning something new. I can't quite get it at first and to find out-- a little more enjoyable than learning something new instantly, understand it. No. I guess it's probably why, plus, I didn't [keep?] on learning lots of new things, so."
597.0,601.0,Interviewer,Nice.
601.0,602.0,Subject,I guess I'm just novelty seeking.
602.0,610.0,Interviewer,"Yes. That's a good way to do that. I mean, it brings you a lot of new stuff, right? But you said you might be looking for another job."
610.0,745.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's partially because there's not a whole lot of novelty in this current job, which would be okay if not for the fact that, also, we don't have a senior dev. So all of us are working at about the same level of skill, which means that there's no real way to know like, ""Are we doing this the right way? Are we doing this just like the way that we sort of be the [pawn?], because we're just not all that experienced yet?"" Because we've all been working in the industry for less than 2 years. And so it would be nice to go somewhere where there are some senior leaderships that could know where exactly I'm messing up and where exactly I'm doing it correctly or working somewhere where it feels like-- also, it's a very small company. So it's basically the dev team and then our CTO and then our CEO. And also, I sit, literally, one table away from our CEO, so I make awkward eye contact a lot. But he doesn't really talk to me over 9 months of me being there. We got a lot of annoying announcements from up top. Because we don't really have any analysis. We don’t really have very much analytics. And the analytics guy we do have isn't really listened to. Well, she doesn’t listen to him. And it feels like a lot of her suggestions and a lot of her data that she has collected, over who likes her once he doesn't, is just ignored based on [inaudible] of it feels it's right. And so it feels like we also get a lot of just arbitrative announcements from up high based that sort of thing. And this is kind of an annoying situation I'd rather not have to deal with. I could deal with, I guess, somewhere where we'd make changes based on what works instead of what feels kind of correct to someone in charge, who doesn't have that experience. Because he basically inherited the company too. So he doesn't really have that much actual business experience."
745.0,746.0,Interviewer,Interesting.
746.0,766.0,Subject,"He's kind of the large adult son of his [laughter]-- that's probably a little bit more mean than I needed to be. But he's also kind of a jerk. But he's kind of the large adult son of his family, so. Because I'm just like, ""Oh, no. It's the microphone."""
766.0,779.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]. Is he more on the actual jewelry company side? And so he's not listening to things that the website--
779.0,826.0,Subject,"Yeah. He was a gemologist. So he knows a lot about the jewelry itself. He knows a lot about how it's built, that sort of thing. It's very respectable. But he doesn't need to know a whole lot about how the jewelry business works, which is a little bit strange. Because we have a woman who knows a lot about how that works, a lot about who exactly is accessing our site, what pages they like more and less, etc. And she's just ignored a lot of the time in favor of his opinions, which is, I guess, his prerogative. But it feels like it's also a wasteful prerogative, I guess."
826.0,832.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Let's see. So how long has he been in this position?
832.0,852.0,Subject,"He's been the CEO for, I think, four years, long before I got there. But Molly, who's the analytics lady, has been working there for 6 years or something like that. But [Barry?], the old CEO, was kind of terrible too. So who knows?"
852.0,853.0,Interviewer,His father? Okay.
853.0,868.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I think that his father is a member of the board, but I think the old CEO was not in the family. But I think that it could definitely be qualified as a family business."
868.0,874.0,Interviewer,And do you like their products? Do you use your own [jewelry?]?
874.0,900.0,Subject,"I'm really not a jewelry person. I'm not going to lie. The first thing that came to mind for diamonds for me, before I got there was, ""Oh, blood diamonds [laughter]."" I actually asked a question during the interview, and my interviewer was the CTO. He was like, ""No, no, no, we don’t do blood diamonds. I promise."" I'm like, ""I'm not sure if I believe you, but all right [laughter]. I feel like you wouldn't tell me if we used blood diamonds."""
900.0,914.0,Interviewer,So it sounds like you have a really nice trajectory. What do you see yourself doing further down the line with this in general?
914.0,962.0,Subject,"Me going back to grad school. I did really like psychology. And I really feel like it would be nice to move back in that direction. But I also really like tech. So I feel like I need to figure out some way to sort of integrate the two. I'm not sure how exactly. And I'm not sure if I exactly even want to go for a grad degree and probably more on psych. Because I feel like computer science is a lot easier to teach yourself. I feel like in psychology [inaudible] values and that's kind of [inaudible] experience. And I feel like with tech, a lot of the value is in just learning the technology. It's definitely easier to learn the technology by yourself instead of trying to go out and hurrying people into psychological interviews off the street [laughter]. "
962.0,970.0,Interviewer,"Well, I try not to hurry anybody on the street. But what do you think interested you the most about psychology?"
970.0,991.0,Subject,"A couple of things. I really liked the neurology class I took and psychophysiology class I took. Those were really fun. And I feel like I would have liked my abnormal psych class if it was taught by a more interesting person. [inaudible] humanly possible, but I still liked it."
991.0,993.0,Interviewer,And weren't you using DSM [laughter]?
993.0,1022.0,Subject,"Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, the DSM, we learned it. But it looked like that. But I guess I really liked theories of mind. And I really liked the biological underpinnings of how the brain works and how we figure out how our thoughts work, etc. I feel this is just wild. And I feel like I'd like just to learn more about this."
1022.0,1023.0,Interviewer,Cool.
1023.0,1028.0,Subject,I don't think I would want to be a psychiatrist or therapist.
1028.0,1030.0,Interviewer,Why not?
1030.0,1066.0,Subject,"It seems like a really tough profession. Because one of my friends, she was also a psychology major. And then she went to grad school. She became a crisis counselor. That's a really tough job for her. Because she just happens to deal with a lot of just people in very bad positions, etc. I know that not all therapy is like that. But she [inaudible] coming home, feeling a little bit exhausted. Even if it was a good day for her, it was a tough day. I feel like I probably couldn't do that."
1066.0,1081.0,Interviewer,"I understand that. Because it's management, it's also a very high-stakes game right now. So how do you fill in your day after work? What do you do?"
1081.0,1114.0,Subject,"A lot of the times, I go with my coworkers. It's weird. We're just walking around New York City a lot. So that's kind of nice. I go home and read, play video games. I've gotten into rock climbing a little bit more, which is nice. I really want to get back into fencing, because I did that in high school and college. But I have no clue where all my equipment is [laughter]. Frankly, the thought of buying it for staring over again sounds really tiring. But it would be nice."
1114.0,1116.0,Interviewer,Do you rock climb at the gym?
1116.0,1121.0,Subject,Yeah. I go to The Cliffs at Long Island City.
1121.0,1123.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. That's far."
1123.0,1144.0,Subject,Kind of. I live in Bushwick. I live in Midtown. So I just need to take the NQRW up to Long-- and not all of those lines. I don't remember which one [inaudible] go to Long Island City. But at least two of them do. Or I just take the M. It also goes back to Bushwick.
1144.0,1148.0,Interviewer,What do you like about rock climbing?
1148.0,1174.0,Subject,"It's fun. I like feeling my body work, I guess. And I develop a muscle pretty naturally like, ""Okay. After wall climbing, I'm tired."" Because I'm fairly tall. And bouldering is challenging, because being tall isn't much of an advantage. So if I want something easy, I can just rock climb on the actual tall walls. And if I want it to be a little bit more difficult, I can try bouldering and probably fall off the wall a lot [laughter]."
1174.0,1179.0,Interviewer,So what is the difference between bouldering and rock climbing?
1179.0,1220.0,Subject,"Rock climbing is a lot more you have a different path to go up a very high wall. You have to be belayed. You have to have the rope attached. You have someone holding onto the rope at the bottom. It's a pulley system. So it's pretty safe. And I've never actually seen someone fall off the wall and get hurt or whatever. You need to use the belay. But bouldering is more free-climbing. The walls are a lot shorter. But they're also a lot stranger, strange rock configurations, that sort of thing. So it's a lot more about trying to find you way up the wall by yourself instead of climbing up the wall in a very linear way."
1220.0,1222.0,Interviewer,Challenging.
1222.0,1225.0,Subject,Yes. It's cool.
1225.0,1228.0,Interviewer,And how did you find rock climbing?
1228.0,1242.0,Subject,One my friends mentioned it. I went with him a few times. And it was pretty fun. And so now we go probably about half the time together and half the time just whenever we feel like it.
1242.0,1246.0,Interviewer,So you walk around New York. What kinds of things do you like to do?
1246.0,1282.0,Subject,"We went to that god-awful, shawarma-looking thing the other day. The sort of honeycomb-looking-- I can't remember what it's called. It's on 34th Street. You've probably seen in some news article about it at some point. It's like it's literally all stairwells going up three stories, and then you sort of just do nothing there."
1282.0,1285.0,Interviewer,Never heard of it.
1285.0,1311.0,Subject,"No? It's an interesting architectural feature, I guess. It's kind of new. I can't tell what exactly it's called. Anyways, we went to that. We work near the Empire State Building. So that's kind of cool. Trying to urban explore a little bit, trying to see what exactly is around us, this is fun. Sorry. It's really bothering me that I forgot what it's called. The Vessel."
1311.0,1312.0,Interviewer,"The Vessel, I don't know that."
1312.0,1315.0,Subject,No? Okay [laughter].
1315.0,1319.0,Interviewer,How long have you been in New York?
1319.0,1325.0,Subject,"About two years, actually. About two years."
1325.0,1328.0,Interviewer,And do you enjoy it? Is it a big a change?
1328.0,1382.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's a big change, not a huge change. Mostly, I just miss my car. But I don't know. I feel like New York might not be my forever city. I'd like to be here for a couple more years, work here a little bit, and make some more money. And then probably move - I don't know - even somewhere like Chicago would be nice in terms of being able to take my own car to come places, not having to rely on public transport, being a little bit more spread out, a little bit less cramped than New York City is. Because New York is just very, very tight, not tight-knit, but definitely not [pennyworth?]. But I won't say cramped, because it sounds so negative. But it definitely very much feels like you're trying to pack eight million people in a not eight-million-people-size space."
1382.0,1391.0,Interviewer,That's fair [laughter]. What do you think appeals to you about starting out?
1391.0,1405.0,Subject,"Partially the esthetic, partially just the feeling like I'm not constantly surrounded by people. Also being able to buy a cheaper and larger apartment, that would be very nice."
1405.0,1414.0,Interviewer,"So not being surrounded by people, why is that something that is appealing to you? What do you think?"
1414.0,1449.0,Subject,"I think there's nothing quite like getting on the subway at 6:30, going back home, and just having to stand up and contort myself just to grab the pole and not be run over by some random person with a bike is just-- I don't know. There's nothing that I can really use to describe that sort of feeling that's happening every day. It's a little bit unbearable."
1449.0,1457.0,Interviewer,Interesting. Do you think [starting?] out would ever be lonely?
1457.0,1490.0,Subject,"I mean, I could still meet people. It just wouldn't ever be just-- I don't really think so, no. I wasn't lonely in Texas, and there was a lot more room there. Although I was living in a house with seven of my friends, a very generously-sized house though [laughter]. And I was also paying $450 for rent. So no, I don't really think so. Oh, God, I really miss $450 [laughter]."
1490.0,1495.0,Interviewer,"And the rent, is this pretty high? Is Texas where you grew up?"
1495.0,1498.0,Subject,Kind of. I grew up in Texas and Oklahoma.
1498.0,1507.0,Interviewer,Okay. So that is a pretty [laughter] big change. What do you miss most about it besides the space?
1507.0,1535.0,Subject,"The people I knew. There's not really that much to miss about Texas in itself. I know that people are always like, ""Don't mess with Texas,"" sort of. But I feel like, ""Honestly, we have planes. We have gas stations. We have cows [laughter]."" But Texas does not have a lot that's unique about Texas. Oh, yeah. I miss the Tex-Mex a lot. But I feel like New York has enough interesting foods to make up for it."
1535.0,1536.0,Interviewer,"Oh, I see."
1536.0,1596.0,Subject,"Yeah. But that's about it. I don't miss the weather. The summers were awful. The winters were meh. But I don't think I might really miss anything else. Even Dallas was nice. But it felt like the entire city was a suburb. Do you know what I mean? Central Dallas was probably 5 miles of high-rises. And then the surrounding Dallas areas were about 50 miles of suburbs. So I'm very much okay of not having that to deal with anymore. And I have been in Dallas traffic. Even here, it does take 50 minutes to go six and a half miles as my trip here kind of grew. Yeah, it did take me also an hour and a half to get here for some reason."
1596.0,1597.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1597.0,1607.0,Subject,"Well, the M was out, which is what I normally take, and the J, which is is pretty convenient, also have a bunch of toys for some reason. It's an outlier but [inaudible] [laughter]."
1607.0,1620.0,Interviewer,"Well, thank you for coming. We're very glad to have you here. The last few of the answers, you already mentioned you miss the people. Do you find that the people here are different?"
1620.0,1655.0,Subject,"Probably not that different, to be honest. It's just harder to build lots of [connections?] in New York. Because frankly, I feel like after a long day in New York, you're pretty devoted to not having anyone else intrude on your time involuntarily. I guess New York is kind of different. Because you're surrounded by so many people that any impositions on your time becomes like, ""Why is this person trying to talk to me,"" instead of in a smaller place where I can sort of like, ""Oh, this person is trying to talk to me, how interesting."""
1655.0,1661.0,Interviewer,What do you think drives that feeling?
1661.0,1685.0,Subject,"Probably it's the scary number or people you're surrounded with all the time, this awful noise and bustle that you're surrounded with too. You have to block out a lot more in New York than you have to in Texas or anywhere else in the States probably, at least, even in LA."
1685.0,1688.0,Interviewer,So do you find that you feel less social here?
1688.0,1693.0,Subject,"I'd definitely say that, yes."
1693.0,1699.0,Interviewer,Interesting [laughter]. What do you--?
1699.0,1700.0,Subject,Seriously--
1700.0,1702.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Oh, go ahead."
1702.0,1729.0,Subject,"And just that in general, socializing feels like way more I have to make an effort to go out and talk to people than it did back in Texas, where it's sort of like, ""Oh, yes. It's quiet."" I have the privilege of meeting new and interesting fellas and people. Whereas now, it's like if I have to see one more person, I'll just crawl under my covers and stay there forever."
1729.0,1732.0,Interviewer,Wow. But were you in school in Texas?
1732.0,1734.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
1734.0,1738.0,Interviewer,Do you think maybe it's also a [tendency?] to working life?
1738.0,1753.0,Subject,"Probably that too. But even when I was working in Texas, it felt a lot less of a pain to sort of talk to people. I didn't see someone walking towards me and actively feel like, ""Oh, my God, I really hope they don't talk to me,"" like I do in New York."
1753.0,1760.0,Interviewer,"Interesting. Do you think the people are nicer, or it's just that you're tired of talking?"
1760.0,1786.0,Subject,"Probably tired of talking.
