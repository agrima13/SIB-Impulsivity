tmin,tmax,speaker,message
1.0,10.0,Interviewer,Okay. So I guess the first question is how things are going for you lately.
10.0,24.0,Subject,Well I would say some stress because my [visa?] is up in a few weeks and I still don't know where I'm going to be. So I've been dealing with some stress related as to I don't know where I'll be in January.
24.0,24.75,Interviewer,In January.
24.75,25.0,Subject,Yeah.
25.0,28.0,Interviewer,Okay. Do you have any ideas?
28.0,32.0,Subject,"No. No. No, because I don't know if I'll be staying here in New York City or what, so."
32.0,34.0,Interviewer,Oh. You could be moving.
34.0,45.0,Subject,"I mean, I guess, because I was here for my partner was studying in Columbia. So she finished one year, and it's over, so we'll see."
45.0,46.75,Interviewer,So she was studying at Columbia.
46.75,47.0,Subject,Yeah.
47.0,49.0,Interviewer,Where is she now?
49.0,51.0,Subject,Studying data journalism.
51.0,55.0,Interviewer,Oh. What is that [laughter]?
55.0,94.0,Subject,"Well they gather data from-- they do something, I've heard it's called scraping. They go to websites and databanks and they grab information and they make sure it's-- for example, they help a lot of journalists create charts. So a lot of what they do is-- the New York Times, they use fancy charts, so these data journalists, they are gathering this information and presenting it. It's like grabbing complex information and presenting it in very simple, intuitive ways."
94.0,101.0,Interviewer,That's great. [inaudible] accessible. So you came here with her.
101.0,102.0,Subject,Yeah.
102.0,103.0,Interviewer,Where were you before?
103.0,104.0,Subject,Puerto Rico.
104.0,105.0,Interviewer,Really?
105.0,106.0,Subject,Yeah.
106.0,108.0,Interviewer,How long have you been there?
108.0,113.0,Subject,Pretty much all my life except when I was in the military.
113.0,122.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So you were born there, spent much of your time there. And how was it when you joined the military when you moved?"
122.0,123.0,Subject,Excuse me?
123.0,126.0,Interviewer,How was it to move away after being there?
126.0,133.0,Subject,"I mean, it was interesting. It was an interesting thing to do. I mean, I was so young and I just wanted to do new things."
133.0,134.0,Interviewer,You were young.
134.0,137.0,Subject,Yeah. I was 19.
137.0,140.0,Interviewer,Wow. [inaudible]. So what kinds of new things did you do?
140.0,186.0,Subject,"Well I guess just the rigorous activity, the infantry, and also I guess it was new to me having to be with my people that worked with me, because sometimes I would get extremely drunk, and since I was the minor and I could not drink, they would call me, ""Oh, can you please drive me here. Drive me there."" So I guess that was an experience I hadn't had before, and that kind of thing, but besides that I was pretty-- I did my work. I went to eat, I went to my room, and--"
186.0,189.0,Interviewer,So what kind of work did you do?
189.0,256.0,Subject,"It's called opposition force. What we did was we were in a desert in California, and they have these mock towns as if they were Afghanistan or Iraq, and you would have a very-- you would be surprised how complex are these. You have a bunch of people who are pretending to be bad guys, and you also have subcontractors that are pretending to be interpreters, and but they really are interpreters. So they're paid, and you have this whole experience, and it really prepares soldiers before they would deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan, and they would go to the desert in California where it's very hot, very similar conditions to what they would experience, and they would start to learn about hydration. And just getting them ready-- so it's a three-weeks process cycle that soldiers go through before going to the theater of war."
256.0,258.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] to the what?
258.0,273.0,Subject,"To the theater of war. They call it a theater. The theater. Wherever the conflict is. And back then it was Iraq, and now it's Afghanistan."
273.0,275.0,Interviewer,Why do you think they call it a theater?
275.0,301.0,Subject,"It's very interesting but it's a word that's been used by many historians for centuries, the theater. It's interesting. [inaudible]. I guess the people that are fighting are in some ways actors, right, for the politicians that send them there, in some ways, right? So I guess in a way they are kind of like actors but they are playing with their lives in some ways."
301.0,304.0,Interviewer,What do you mean actors?
304.0,334.0,Subject,"Well a lot of them don't even know the countries that they're being sent to. I mean, most people don't know where Afghanistan is or Iraq or they said Somali in the '90s. They wouldn't know because of it. They just joined the military because they want some benefits maybe and work, and they get sent to places, and I guess [inaudible] a proxy."
334.0,341.0,Interviewer,Yeah. In a lot of ways that must be true. So why did you join the military?
341.0,358.0,Subject,"I didn't want to take the student loans. So I was very enticed by serving for a few years, and then be able to do my bachelor's degree without having to incur [inaudible] but I'm happy I did it that way."
358.0,359.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
359.0,389.0,Subject,"I am. I mean, I have friends that are not happy with the amount of debt that burden they took for law school. A lot of them are lawyers now, but owe $200,000 in student loan debts, and they're like they would say to me, ""If I could go back I would not go to law school."" They don't feel happy with how much they have to pay each month in loans, so."
389.0,396.0,Interviewer,So how many years did you do before you went and got [inaudible] degree?
396.0,398.0,Subject,Almost three.
398.0,399.0,Interviewer,And where were you?
399.0,400.0,Subject,It was in California.
400.0,401.0,Interviewer,Oh. So you--
401.0,418.75,Subject,"Yeah. It was in the one deployment, yeah. I mean, I just did the one tour or one contract, yeah. Because then I also had an injury, so training accident, and thanks to that I could not do my job anymore, so I was removed."
418.75,419.0,Interviewer,You were?
419.0,421.0,Subject,Yeah.
421.0,422.0,Interviewer,So what was that like?
422.0,423.0,Subject,What?
423.0,425.0,Interviewer,The injury and doing [inaudible].
425.0,460.0,Subject,"Well happy to be alive, certainly. I mean, I spent a lot of time in the hospital because of it, so I'm happy that I'm alive. I can walk and I can do things because when I was in the hospital I saw some very young guys with some very serious injuries. I mean, no legs, no hands. Very serious burns. So I was in a way-- I mean, just getting better, but I was also very wary of there's some people that they were really, really struggling with some serious issues."
460.0,465.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And that sounds serious if you got removed.
465.0,497.0,Subject,"No, absolutely. I mean, the vehicle, it ran over me. I had a vehicle run over me, and they had to put some rods, and they had to put an external fixator, some metal wires here and a bar to put my pelvis in place. So it was a process, but again, compared to having the other guys that had no legs and no arms, and they had bags coming out of their stomach, that kind of stuff, so at the end of the day I think I was lucky. Very lucky."
497.0,499.0,Interviewer,Oh. [inaudible].
499.0,509.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, there is difficult times in life [inaudible] you just have to go on with it."
509.0,514.0,Interviewer,"Go on, like how?"
514.0,528.0,Subject,"Well, in my case it was to get my leg the best it could be. Walking once again with normalization, and just going back to study and moving on with my life, so."
528.0,531.0,Interviewer,So you studied. What did you study?
531.0,533.0,Subject,Political science.
533.0,537.0,Interviewer,Okay. Well anything specific?
537.0,548.0,Subject,"Well within political science, [inaudible] courses I took on was political theory and public governance."
548.0,549.0,Interviewer,Public governance.
549.0,549.75,Subject,Yeah.
549.75,550.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
550.0,560.0,Subject,"Well, I mean, I suppose it's studying the structure of governments and how government functions."
560.0,563.0,Interviewer,How does it [laughter]?
563.0,588.0,Subject,"Well, I mean, in my case I pretty much studied the ones-- the government of Puerto Rico on a state level and the national level, the federal government level. So I was always very interested in that and also in political theory and to liberal [inaudible] that kind of stuff. That kind of [inaudible]."
588.0,590.0,Interviewer,What do you think drew you to this?
590.0,673.0,Subject,"Well it was always-- for some reason, I was always goaded into political thinking. I remember when I was very young, when I was in-- when was this? I was in elementary-- I don't know. I was in seventh grade. It was the year 2000 when the federal election of George Bush and Al Gore was being-- yeah, these big trials because it was so contested. It was by one vote. It was deciding our presidency. And I would come from school, and my dad would be like, ""Oh, come here and watch this with me."" And I was like, ""Oh, why do I have to watch these old people fighting? I don't really understand."" And my father would say, ""This is a very important election. They're going to talk about this election for the rest of the history and you can't miss this."" Ever since then I was very interested in what was going on in government and who are the judges and who are the senators, that kind of stuff. Since then, so I suppose it's almost 20 years now I've been very interested."
673.0,679.0,Interviewer,Interesting. So your father really kind of brought you to it.
679.0,683.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely."
683.0,691.0,Interviewer,Do you think he [inaudible] in other ways as well?
691.0,697.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, of course. I mean, he raised me, so I mean, I was [inaudible] all my life, so I suppose yeah."
697.0,701.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
701.0,758.0,Subject,"Well I suppose he influenced me in how I perceive the way to cohabit in the family because, I mean, at least in my family-- and it's something that I noticed later after I was an adult, how in some ways privileged I was to have been born and raised with my mom and my dad and have them together all their lives. So to me that was normal, but I never-- [inaudible] after I was an adult I realized as well, not many people have that, and it's very different life history. And so I suppose that did shape me and the way I think about things."
758.0,759.0,Interviewer,In what way?
759.0,782.0,Subject,"Well because I was raised in a certain stable household, and when you have a stable house you can worry about other things. You can afford the luxury of not having to see your parents fight and had to travel to see them and that kind of thing. So I think it would have been different if I had gone through a different experience."
782.0,785.0,Interviewer,How would you be different?
785.0,805.0,Subject,"Well that's interesting. I mean, I haven't really thought about it. Frankly, I've never thought about it, but I don't know [inaudible] but I don't think I'd be the same, frankly."
805.0,816.0,Interviewer,And do you think it's influenced you with your own family?
816.0,818.0,Subject,Yes. Yes. It has.
818.0,820.0,Interviewer,How so?
820.0,887.0,Subject,"Well because, to me, it's very important to try to be as much as I can-- because I have [biological and a?] stepson, and it's important to me. It's important to me that they see me-- for example, I picked the youngest at four and I'll take him to the library and we'll do-- he'll sit down and do his homework. I mean, just painting and that kind of thing. And then pick up the other one at six and I have this thing. I constantly ask them-- I'm always trying to reassure I guess myself in a way. I ask him, ""Who loves you?"" I mean, ""Who gives you love?"" And I want to here him say, ""You. [inaudible] Doritos [inaudible] you."" I want him to say that I'm [inaudible] I don't know why I do that but to me it's important that he feels loved, they feel loved."
887.0,902.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's really sweet. Excuse me. So you're the biological [inaudible] stepchild and when you see them both it sounds like every day you're very involved in their lives.
902.0,904.0,Subject,Yeah.
904.0,907.0,Interviewer,What is it like to have children?
907.0,1001.0,Subject,"Well I think it's-- I mean, I think-- and I guess going back to the question that you said how it influenced me or how could it make me feel different had I been raised in a different situation, I always said to myself, ""One day I'm going to be a father."" I said to myself-- I have a lot of friends, and I respect them really because they say, ""Oh, I don't like kids. I don't want kids. I'm not interested in that."" And I respect it because after becoming a father I do realize that it's really not for everyone [laughter] really. And so I always said to myself that I wanted-- and I'm happy that [inaudible] I'm still relatively young, because when I came here we noticed that a lot of the other parents are in their 50s or in their 40s now that they became parents when they were 42. Another one came when they were 45. So now they're like 50 or 45ish and around that area and they're like, ""Oh, I love being the dad, but the energy is just not there anymore."" So I'm happy that this is now and by the time in 43 I'll be done with it-- I mean, done with the getting them to adult part. So I'm happy about that because I have the energy now and--"
1001.0,1006.0,Interviewer,So it takes a lot of energy then. I don't have children [laughter].
1006.0,1146.0,Subject,"Well they give and you take. They give and you take. But frankly it does get better by the time they're four or-- I would say four because they can be-- for example, they love to watch a show on Netflix or on Amazon, so I would be like-- yesterday it was [inaudible] example. It was with the youngest in the library. We had a snack, then we picked the oldest school [inaudible] we've got-- we got him something to eat. Quick meal. We came back. I told the oldest one, ""Look, he already did one hour and something of homework. I want you to do some the same."" It was 7:00 so he did about 7:00 to 7:45. He was doing cursive, workbook, and some reading, and some math homework, and after he was done I would-- the other one was playing Legos by himself. And then when he was done I would watch 25 minute of show and quick shower and by 8:55 I had them in bed, which is late because usually I put them to bed at 8:00. But sometimes since we're getting back home at 7:00 I want to get them home and mainly just getting them to bed in one hour. So it is. And I do suppose how you do them because a lot of the other parents in my oldest son's school - he's seven - and he's with six year old and seven year olds, and they're already very troubled because their kids, they just want to be playing video games. They go home and they just want to play video games or just be watching TV. And I guess we did it differently because we want to put a balance-- they don't have video games and just very limited TV. And so I like to have them building and doing those kinds of things because it's very important I think to have them-- the technology away from it as much as you can."
1146.0,1150.0,Interviewer,Really. Why do you think that's important?
1150.0,1197.0,Subject,"Well I'm not sure how healthy it is for them to be spending so many hours with their neck going down because they're growing. I mean, they're growing every moment, and if they spend-- let's say they spend two or three hours a day with their neck in an unnatural position, just make-- if you take all those hours that they spend like that within 7 and 17 year olds, it's going to be months and months where their neck is in that position, and I'm afraid how that would affect them when they're older. I do think maybe their neck will be fine now, but what about when he's 40? He's going to be all messed up like a hunchback or something [laughter]."
1197.0,1204.0,Interviewer,Sorry. Interesting. And you said that you like to have them build.
1204.0,1205.0,Subject,Yeah.
1205.0,1208.0,Interviewer,What's the motivation behind that?
1208.0,1250.0,Subject,"Well they don't have the luxury I had. I had a big place where I could go out and run and run and run unimpeded and go up trees, and they don't. And since I don't want them in a video game I want them to be-- I get them Legos, and they're making things, and they have a lot of dinosaurs. [inaudible] some pictures, but they-- I do it because I want them-- I know that eventually they're going to take tests like the SAT and they need to start developing spatial abilities. How to put shapes and things together and I want them to develop that way."
1250.0,1254.0,Interviewer,Interesting. So spatial intelligence. [crosstalk].
1254.0,1256.0,Subject,Yeah. Absolutely. I think it's very important. Yeah.
1256.0,1259.0,Interviewer,Why is that?
1259.0,1280.0,Subject,"It's what you engage with in the world. I mean, you're out there, everything is shape. The street, everything is shapes, and if you're watching too much TV you're not developing how to see things, how to estimate distances, and how to just put things together."
1280.0,1287.0,Interviewer,Interesting. And so you said that in your childhood you had a lot of space to run around [crosstalk].
1287.0,1288.0,Subject,I did.
1288.0,1292.0,Interviewer,How do you think that affected you positively?
1292.0,1369.0,Subject,"Well maybe I had too much space. I mean, maybe I had-- because, frankly, my parents with me they would always give me a lot of leeway to do things. Ever since I was very young I could just go and go to my cousin's house nearby and just stay there and come back. [inaudible] but by early, but and then when I was in high school I could-- and I suppose it wasn't that good the way that I was given too much liberty because I could have done something bad. I could have done something risky. Especially during high school years. But thankfully nothing bad ever happened. But I did sometimes go to school on Friday and come back on Sunday. [inaudible] my mom would be like-- they wouldn't even ask. ""What are you doing?"" And I was not doing things bad things. I was just with friends and just hanging out at their houses and just doing my own thing, but I suppose it's not that good to have that much amount of liberty now that I look back at it."
1369.0,1371.0,Interviewer,It sounds like your very responsible.
1371.0,1376.0,Subject,"Oh, absolutely. I understand, but it could have led to something bad. It could have. It could have happened."
1376.0,1380.0,Interviewer,They must have known that you were responsible.
1380.0,1381.0,Subject,Yeah.
1381.0,1389.0,Interviewer,Do you think that they-- well do you think you won't do the same thing with your children?
1389.0,1393.0,Subject,Well I don't think-- I'm sorry.
1393.0,1395.0,Interviewer,"No, no, no. That's okay. I'm actually [inaudible]."
1395.0,1399.0,Subject,"I don't think that their mom would allow it [laughter], so."
1399.0,1402.0,Interviewer,Really? Is she stricter than your [inaudible]?
1402.0,1404.0,Subject,I think so.
1404.0,1412.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]. Stricter how?
1412.0,1415.0,Subject,"I mean, she's more systematic. She's more--"
1415.0,1416.0,Interviewer,Systematic.
1416.0,1418.0,Subject,Yeah.
1418.0,1420.0,Interviewer,What is systematic?
1420.0,1435.75,Subject,"I mean, she's just very thorough. I mean, she's just very-- in whatever she's done in life she's been very excellent at it. She would be freaking out about 98%. That kind of personality."
1435.75,1436.0,Interviewer,"Oh, like on a test."
1436.0,1469.0,Subject,"On a test. Yeah. Unlike me, she's a good tester. She could take that test that I took and she would do it with her eyes closed and gently. She would do it. She has those kind of skills. And also she's just, as I said, more thorough. And she believes in [inaudible] ""We're ready. I have to get them ready for college,"" and that kind of thing. She's like that. So I don't think she would be like, ""Well you can go and just stay the night."" I don't think she's going to be like that."
1469.0,1474.0,Interviewer,So do you think you guys are different in that way?
1474.0,1497.0,Subject,"No, no, no. I think that they will have plenty of time to do their own thing once they're adults, but time is so precious that I feel they have to put some amount of pressure to have them-- until they graduate from high school."
1497.0,1502.0,Interviewer,So what happens then?
1502.0,1528.0,Subject,"Well I don't know. I don't know what happens, but I tell them it's nice when they're finally doing college and doing that because you have more time for yourself and you're reaping what you sower, I guess. But so I don't know. My oldest one has the [inaudible] grade but I feel that the way I am, I'm going to be relieved I think."
1528.0,1530.0,Interviewer,Really. Relieved.
1530.0,1532.0,Subject,"I will. I think so, yeah."
1532.0,1534.0,Interviewer,About what?
1534.0,1561.0,Subject,"Well I suppose if they both graduate from high school and they go to the university, if that's what they want to do or not-- I think frankly whatever kind of thing they take I think their mom would be really, really, really inclined to have them go to college [inaudible] but I'm going to be let them decide by themselves and just be happy."
1561.0,1568.0,Interviewer,Okay. So what are your hopes and dreams for them?
1568.0,1599.0,Subject,"Just to be happy. I mean, my hopes and dreams is that they're always true to themselves first and to the world about who they are and what they believe in. I would hope that they have integrity, that they would do the right thing. I tell them do the right thing even when no one is looking. And I suppose if they're honest to themselves and have integrity, with that I would be pretty much please I think."
1599.0,1601.0,Interviewer,Sounds like a good goal.
1601.0,1609.0,Subject,Yeah. I think so. I think [inaudible] those things. You're in good shape to take on anything.
1609.0,1619.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And when they are off and you have all this time, what do you see yourself doing?"
1619.0,1621.0,Subject,"Well I want to get into politics. I mean, I want to--"
1621.0,1622.0,Interviewer,Really?
1622.0,1664.0,Subject,"Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, not as if me running for a position but working in a political environment, definitely. Definitely it's what I would like to do. And I'll be-- I won't be ancient, so I mean, but that's what I would like to do. Of course my partner, she's also very, very driven, and we are working with-- her brother's also working with politics, and I would love if she were to get a position like that. I would really support her as well."
1664.0,1668.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And what kind of politics are you interested in?
1668.0,1676.0,Subject,Like American politics. Like international politics.
1676.0,1679.0,Interviewer,But you don't want to run for office?
1679.0,1712.0,Subject,"No, no. I wouldn't like to because I'm not-- I mean, maybe you remember vaguely about the kind of answers I was giving you regarding the people and how I like to spend time with people. I'm not a people person. I don't like spending-- I don't like pretending I care about people. It has to be someone that cares or can pretend to care about other people, and I can't do that. But there's a lot of work for people in politics that don't have the interpersonal skills."
1712.0,1714.0,Interviewer,Like what?
1714.0,1726.0,Subject,Speech writing. Public relations. Lobbying. That kind of thing. Political advice. Political consultant.
1726.0,1731.0,Interviewer,So what does the political consultant do?
1731.0,1752.75,Subject,"They get paid to, for example, if you're consulting on polls-- so for example, there's people they just hire firms to conduct polls and you get that information and advice based on that information how are you going to talk about certain issues. It's just how to win an election--"
1752.75,1753.0,Interviewer,So like strategy.
1753.0,1762.0,Subject,Strategy. It's strategy. It's a strategy. It's just a matter of what the situation and let's fix it. [inaudible].
1762.0,1767.0,Interviewer,So what do you think draws you to that rather than the interpersonal side?
1767.0,1824.0,Subject,"Because I am interested in politics as power. I'm interested in power and how power is affected and how we will use power to crush your enemies and help your friends. Because at least here in the United States, that's the way it is. I mean, a presidency, you win or you lose. You have two candidates. One of them is going to win. One of them is going to lose. And in politics it's the same way. You're either winning or you're losing. And whoever is your political opponent, he's your enemy, right? Those words sound rough, but I use them strictly as a political word. It's not like I want to [laughter] dump him in a river or something. I just want to beat them in the election so I can get the power."
1824.0,1826.0,Interviewer,And so what's important about that power?
1826.0,1857.0,Subject,"Because you can do good things. You can help people with power. I mean, if you have-- if what the other person is offering you believe or the facts show that it could hurt people or not help them enough and you have an alternative that they can prove that can deliver to help people and make their lives better then that's why I want power because I want to be able to do the things that I want to do."
1857.0,1859.0,Interviewer,And that's primarily helping people.
1859.0,1875.0,Subject,"Primarily helping people. But of course, I mean, a politician-- yeah. We want to help people, but someone has to run. Someone has to win the election. And [inaudible] if you win the election then you can do all the other stuff, policies that can help other people. Yeah."
1875.0,1888.0,Interviewer,So what do you think if you were in office? What would be kind of-- or if you could help a candidate what do you think would be the most ideal?
1888.0,1892.0,Subject,In what kind of office? It just depends on what kind of office.
1892.0,1893.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk] that's true. That's--
1893.0,1986.0,Subject,"I mean, I don't know. I mean, I guess ensure that whatever you're doing, whatever dealings you have with financing and with money, it's well audited. The documents are very-- everything is clear so you don't have to be worrying about violations. I would say help people have better lives, better wages, better access to some healthcare, and there's people that are born that ever since they were born stats say they have no chance. A lot of people are born here in New York City and then-- okay, I can bet that someone was born 18 years ago and they haven't left this city. They haven't left this state, probably, and a lot of them will never because ever since they were born, they were born into difficult situations with their family, drugs, violence, so to help that kind of person. The person that is born and seemingly without their having any input on it they're just put into a very bad situation. How do you take care of that person? How do you make sure that he has an equal chance to get along in life?"
1986.0,1995.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And why do you think that's important to you?
1995.0,2025.0,Subject,"Well, I mean, I'm someone that believes that I just have one life. I mean, I don't believe in anything after death, and I suppose to me it's important-- I mean, how will I be remembered in a way? Were you someone that just took care of yourself or were you someone that wanted to help other people? And for me it's important to think in that way, and as someone who has studied history, I think I'd like to be remembered as someone that tried to help others."
