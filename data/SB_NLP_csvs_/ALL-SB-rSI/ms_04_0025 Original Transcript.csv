0.0,5.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So tell me, how have things been going for you lately?"
5.0,9.0,Subject,They've been going.
9.0,11.0,Interviewer,Okay.
11.0,16.0,Subject,"It's kind of a vague question, right?"
16.0,17.0,Interviewer,Yep.
17.0,22.0,Subject,"Everything's been all right, can't complain. I mean, I can, but who's really going to listen?"
22.0,26.0,Interviewer,Me.
26.0,30.0,Subject,"Yeah, everything's been going great for the most part."
30.0,32.0,Interviewer,What's great?
32.0,51.0,Subject,Great is you wake up another day. You have a job to go to. You have a roof over your head. That's great. Things can always get better. But it's all about how you look at it and how you deal with it.
51.0,57.0,Interviewer,So how do you look at it?
57.0,70.0,Subject,"I look at it as a blessing. I look at it as another day where-- it's a learning opportunity. Another day where you can go out and do something productive. If you don't, what's the point of going out and what's the point of waking up?"
70.0,74.0,Interviewer,"So, productive. What does that mean?"
74.0,100.0,Subject,Productive. To do something you had your mind set on to-- whether it even be to take a step in that direction. To find a solution to problems you were unable to resolve the day before. To learn something new. It's all productive.
100.0,109.0,Interviewer,Okay. And what do you do to be productive?
109.0,145.0,Subject,"Small steps. I set a goal in place which is attainable. My goals are broken down into a 24-hour span. So when I wake up in the morning or before the previous day has passed, I come up with a goal for the next day. There's no point in worrying about what's going to happen in 10 years. Let's worry about what's going to happen tomorrow. If you can control that, then you might be on the right path to go somewhere with yourself."
145.0,148.0,Interviewer,So what is today's goal?
148.0,164.0,Subject,Today's goal was to wake up and help as many as possible. Whether it be a research study. Whether it be a plate of food. Just help as many as possible.
164.0,173.0,Interviewer,"So you're succeeding at the research part, obviously. Okay. So tell me, what is a day in the life?"
173.0,177.0,Subject,A day in the life. A day in the life is what you make of it.
177.0,181.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So, yesterday?"
181.0,202.0,Subject,"Yesterday was a very eventful day. A lot of moving around. A lot of resolving situations, resolving what other people couldn't figure out. That's what my life consists of a lot. Figuring other people's problems out."
202.0,204.0,Interviewer,What kind of problem?
204.0,213.0,Subject,"Whether it be mechanical, whether it be advice, whatever it may be. Whatever's kind of tossed my way."
213.0,215.0,Interviewer,"So yesterday, a lot was tossed your way."
215.0,217.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. Do you mind if I throw this out?"
217.0,219.0,Interviewer,"No, go ahead."
219.0,282.0,Subject,"Yes, that it was. That it was. Let's see. Yesterday I had to wire-- all right. Yesterday I had to go to a job site, wire eight floors worth of wiring for an elevator because the individual wasn't too familiar with the nex galaxy boards. After that, I had to go to my uncle's house. Fix his washing machine, replace the motor. After that, I had to go to my grandma's house and replace her ceiling fan and remove the air conditioner. After that, I had to sit there with my cousin for about two and a half hours and listen to his problems, see what was going on with him. Because he seemed to be in a depressed state. A little stressed out. What else? Yeah. Literally, it's just little things as they come is what you do. As they say, you cross that bridge when you get there, right?"
282.0,290.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So it seems like you have a pretty-- you have a routine, almost."
290.0,299.0,Subject,"Yep. Routine establishes structure. Structure establishes strong foundations. Strong foundation, you can build anything on."
299.0,309.0,Interviewer,"So, structure is important to you. And your life seems structured. Has it always been structured?"
309.0,318.0,Subject,"Absolutely not. [laughter] Absolutely not. It's something I've been working on for, I want to say, the past seven years or so."
318.0,320.0,Interviewer,Oh. That's a long time.
320.0,328.0,Subject,"Yeah. I had some children, had to get on point."
328.0,329.0,Interviewer,So you have children?
329.0,337.0,Subject,"Yes. I don't get to see them often. But yes, I do have two children."
337.0,340.0,Interviewer,And when you do see them?
340.0,343.0,Subject,It's been over a year and a half.
343.0,344.0,Interviewer,I'm sorry.
344.0,348.0,Subject,It's all right. It's not your fault.
348.0,352.0,Interviewer,What do you do with them?
352.0,368.0,Subject,"Whatever they want. Last time I did see them, it was the Disney On Ice. So ice skating, because they wanted to skate like Disney On Ice. Mind you, I've never been ice skating a day in my life."
368.0,372.0,Interviewer,How did that go?
372.0,385.0,Subject,"Let's just say the kids skate better than me. But yeah, it was enjoyable. Memorable."
385.0,388.0,Interviewer,So before kids?
388.0,396.0,Subject,I was a hot mess. I was just figuring myself out.
396.0,399.0,Interviewer,Okay. What does that mean?
399.0,417.0,Subject,That means I didn't know what to do with myself. That means I was stuck in the middle of deciding whether I wanted to continue school. Whether I wanted to go get a trade. Whether I wanted to go be a part of the streets. A lot of indecisiveness.
417.0,422.0,Interviewer,And how did you make your decision?
422.0,461.0,Subject,"The decision was made for me. I was involved in a lot of difficult situations, per say, where one of my family members was like, ""Hey, I actually need you to help me move."" And I was like, ""Yeah, sure."" And I was kind of kidnapped after that. It was like, no, we're moving to the furthest place possible and I need you to at least finish school for me. And that's what kind of turned it around."
461.0,462.0,Interviewer,Turned it around?
462.0,476.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's what kind of put me on a path of, you know what, let me get this done. And then after I went to do school was when I actually had my first child and then-- yeah."
476.0,479.0,Interviewer,Okay. So things were different before this?
479.0,496.0,Subject,"Oh, yes. Before this it was me-- before this it was a very aggressive attitude. A very ignorant attitude."
496.0,497.0,Interviewer,Ignorant?
497.0,500.0,Subject,Yes.
500.0,510.0,Interviewer,What does ignorant mean in this context?
510.0,529.0,Subject,"I was a knucklehead. I really didn't sympathize for anybody. I didn't care how anyone felt. It wasn't about them. As unfortunate as it was, I was very inconsiderate."
529.0,543.0,Interviewer,"Inconsiderate. So you used words, aggressive and inconsiderate. What exactly do you mean?"
543.0,621.0,Subject,"Let's see if I can give you an example. Okay. Older gentleman, this was, I want to say 12 years ago, older gentleman's at the supermarket unable to pay for his groceries. I still remember it like it was yesterday because rather than me giving him a hand or whatever may be. Inconsiderate, I decided to lash out at him because he wasn't able to pay and just take all his stuff off of the belt while he was trying to - excuse me - figure out his situation with his payment method. I just took everything off the belt, threw it to the next one, like move out the way. That's when I kind of realized how much of a, excuse the language, how much of an asshole I really was. Yeah. I wasn't too very nice."
621.0,623.0,Interviewer,"That was something that happened regularly, then?"
623.0,625.0,Subject,Yes.
625.0,641.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And what do you think, if anything, was driving that?"
641.0,659.0,Subject,What was driving that? Insecurity. Lack of self-assurance. Me trying to figure myself out at the time.
659.0,663.0,Interviewer,Okay. Insecurity about anything in particular?
663.0,686.0,Subject,"About who I was. As we stated before, my parents died at an early age. Died when I was an early age. After they died, I was supposed to be taken in by my grandmother. Didn't work out too well. Got kicked out at 10."
686.0,687.0,Interviewer,Wow.
687.0,708.0,Subject,"It happens. I was a handful. So the blacktop is what raised me. The streets is what raised me, excuse me. So the way I view things is very different to how other people would."
708.0,724.0,Interviewer,What do you think is the most salient way that you view things differently?
724.0,739.0,Subject,I'm able to look at a situation from both perspectives without being biased. I'm able to actually take a step back and find a solution that everybody was blind to because of their focus and determination on being right in the situation.
739.0,741.0,Interviewer,So you've encountered a lot of that?
741.0,744.0,Subject,Yes.
744.0,748.0,Interviewer,Can you give me an example?
748.0,749.0,Subject,"Unfortunately, I can't."
749.0,758.0,Interviewer,Okay. Why is that?
758.0,762.0,Subject,"Only examples I really have are a bit self-incriminating, so--"
762.0,772.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. Gotcha. Okay, so 10 is really young. What was that like?"
772.0,776.0,Subject,"Well, remember, there's people out there a lot younger."
776.0,783.0,Interviewer,But this is your story. So what was that like?
783.0,788.0,Subject,"It was cold, hard, and a lot of adjusting."
788.0,797.0,Interviewer,Adjusting. Adjusting how?
797.0,828.0,Subject,"Well, when you're used to sleeping with your mother every day, holding onto your mother, you see her take her last breath. There goes your comfort zone. There goes your home, your structure, your foundation. So that takes a bit of a toll. So now you're out here in the street. Where is it you lay? Where is it you feel safe? Where is it you feel loved? You don't."
828.0,830.0,Interviewer,You didn't find that?
830.0,842.0,Subject,You don't find that outside. What you do is you distract yourself. You find other means to distract yourself. You find other means to survive.
842.0,844.0,Interviewer,How so?
844.0,853.0,Subject,"See, we were brought up in the generation where it was either you were brought up on love or you were brought up on survival. And that was just-- how old are you, if you don't mind me asking?"
853.0,855.0,Interviewer,23.
855.0,866.0,Subject,So you were just right outside of that generation. Yeah. We were either brought up on love or survival. There was no both. There was no such thing.
866.0,868.0,Interviewer,No both.
868.0,879.0,Subject,No. It can't be love but put in a position of survival at the same time. This isn't Titanic.
879.0,888.0,Interviewer,Okay. So you were forced into this survival?
888.0,898.0,Subject,"Well, you're never forced. Everything's a choice in life. I could have just kneeled over and just went with the flow, been one of those other individuals that's panhandling and I chose not to be."
898.0,899.0,Interviewer,Panhandling?
899.0,920.0,Subject,Yes. Beggar. I could have been one of those individuals. I could have went to the shelter. I could have went and been on government assistance. I could have went and did these things. There's always a choice. I chose not to. I chose to survive.
920.0,929.0,Interviewer,What went into that choice?
929.0,1008.0,Subject,"That was a-- wow, that was a good question. What went into that choice was my own little self-research. Every family I've noticed, every family I've met, every family I knew up until the time was on any form of government assistance, any form of welfare, anything of the type-- every family I've seen that was on this was never a happy family. Realistically. Were always struggling, always trying to make ends meet, always looking for a way to make it til tomorrow. Now we talk about the families that were well off, that lived further uptown in the Bronx. These families all seemed loving, all seemed to be there for each other, all seemed to want to be there for each other. So once I realized that myself, I refused to be one of these welfare families. I refused to be one of these dysfunctional families. I refused to have a family of my own one day and be a part of that."
1008.0,1026.0,Interviewer,Okay. So you've made these choices and now you have more structure. What do you see going forward?
1026.0,1027.0,Subject,"Remember, I don't think about anything--"
1027.0,1030.0,Interviewer,I know. That's why I'm asking.
1030.0,1033.0,Subject,I can only tell you what I see for tomorrow.
1033.0,1037.0,Interviewer,Okay. Tell me that.
1037.0,1045.0,Subject,"Tomorrow, just to wake up to another beautiful day. Be happy that one woke up. Be appreciate that one woke up."
1045.0,1046.0,Interviewer,Appreciative?
1046.0,1048.0,Subject,There's a lot of people that don't get the chance to wake up.
1048.0,1058.0,Interviewer,I know. So what is your appreciation towards? To what?
1058.0,1070.0,Subject,"Everything, whether it be the good, the bad, the struggle. Everything. Everything's a life experience. You have to take it for what it is."
1070.0,1084.0,Interviewer,"[inaudible] Okay. So, tomorrow. You wake up. You appreciate. What's next?"
1084.0,1093.0,Subject,Take the day as it comes. You can't predict the future. I can only tell you as it comes.
1093.0,1095.0,Interviewer,You can't predict?
1095.0,1099.0,Subject,Nope. All I can do is prepare.
1099.0,1102.0,Interviewer,"Well, how do you prepare?"
1102.0,1109.0,Subject,You prepare by being ready for everything. Anything that may be thrown your way.
1109.0,1110.0,Interviewer,That's a lot of preparation.
1110.0,1112.0,Subject,You think so?
1112.0,1114.0,Interviewer,"Well, what do you mean? For everything?"
1114.0,1123.0,Subject,Everything and anything. You give me a situation.
1123.0,1125.0,Interviewer,Let's say the situation you talked about before.
1125.0,1126.0,Subject,Such as?
1126.0,1128.0,Interviewer,With the older man at the checkout.
1128.0,1138.0,Subject,I've been placed in situations like that and I've spent my last dollar paying for their groceries.
1138.0,1143.0,Interviewer,"And something larger, like you've experienced way in the past?"
1143.0,1144.0,Subject,Such as?
1144.0,1148.0,Interviewer,Loss.
1148.0,1192.0,Subject,"I'm still not too good with loss. I kind of become emotionally detached. I'm more of a shell that's just present. Over the years, I've had issues showing emotion. Showing things like that. Just because those are the things that'll get you put in a very odd predicament. The way I grew up. So now is when I'm actually [trying?] to learn how to open up once again and relate with people and connect with people."
1192.0,1193.0,Interviewer,Learning?
1193.0,1203.0,Subject,"Yes, learning. Everything's a learning experience. I'm not going to say I know how to do it. I'm not a master at it. I don't have a degree in this. And even when you have a degree, everything's a learning experience."
1203.0,1207.0,Interviewer,Okay. So what goes into that learning?
1207.0,1222.0,Subject,Being open-minded. The only way to learn is to be open-minded. You have to be able to accept it for what it is. Not accept it for what you think it is.
1222.0,1226.0,Interviewer,The distinction there. How do you--?
1226.0,1231.0,Subject,We can't put a distinction to that because it's a very generalized statement.
1231.0,1240.0,Interviewer,"Well, what you think it is versus what it is. How can you know both?"
1240.0,1258.0,Subject,"You can't. If you sit there and try to analyze the situation, see, now you're looking at it for what you think it is. No. Just take it for what it is. Take it for what happened. This is what happened. Your opinion and everything like that is just that, an opinion. It's irrelevant to the situation."
1258.0,1259.0,Interviewer,Irrelevant?
1259.0,1266.0,Subject,"Absolutely. Because if you're going to take the situation for what it is, we're talking about the situation. We're not talking about how you feel about the situation."
1266.0,1269.0,Interviewer,Why not?
1269.0,1290.0,Subject,"Because what good does it do? I mean, unless we're talking about a situation where we're trying to overcome a problem, whatever it is, how you feel about it is irrelevant because the situation already transpired. So you can either move on or you can sit there and dwell on it and let it be-- give it this power over you. There's no point."
1290.0,1299.0,Interviewer,Power. [inaudible]
1299.0,1339.0,Subject,The same way if-- someone says something that upsets you. It's not that it upsets you. It's not what they said. It's the fact that you gave these words a power over you. Not a power as in a mythical-- or anything like that. But you gave them dominion over your thoughts. You gave them something where it's just going to bother you all day because you allowed that to happen.
1339.0,1343.0,Interviewer,"So, okay."
1343.0,1345.0,Subject,Please feel free. What is it you--
1345.0,1346.0,Interviewer,"No, this is your--"
1346.0,1356.0,Subject,"No, that's what I'm saying. I'm doing the majority of the talking, so you can-- what's going on?"
1356.0,1379.0,Interviewer,So other people say things and they're not supposed to bother you. It's your own reaction. Does that mean that you don't have a responsibility to act with kindness and knowing of other people's reactions?
1379.0,1386.0,Subject,Why would I have a responsibility? I have two children. I'm not responsible for anyone else.
1386.0,1389.0,Interviewer,"Well, to them, then."
1389.0,1429.0,Subject,"Well, with them it's a whole entirely different situation. Because with children, you have to establish an example. Even though you want them to be their own person, they still need a blueprint, per say. They still need the blueprint of the foundation. They still need to know what's a steady structure so that way they can build their own lives on it. You still have to give them basic rules and principles that are essential to surviving in this world we live in."
1429.0,1432.0,Interviewer,So what is the blueprint you give them?
1432.0,1459.0,Subject,"Unfortunately, I don't have one for them. I'm not in a position to really teach them anything. All I can do is wait. Wait until they're old enough where they want to come learn something. Unfortunately, I'm not in good standings with Mom."
1459.0,1483.0,Interviewer,Good standing.
1483.0,1490.0,Subject,Yeah. Not good standings.
1490.0,1494.0,Interviewer,"So with this blueprint, you've thought about it?"
1494.0,1499.0,Subject,Absolutely. You know how hard it is to come up with your own?
1499.0,1505.0,Interviewer,Vaguely. Can you tell me about yours?
1505.0,1530.0,Subject,"It was rough. How do you teach yourself how to be a good man? No, excuse me. How do you teach yourself how to be a good human? Every day is a life experience. It's trial and error. When you have no other way to do it, the only way to do it is to try it and see if it works."
1530.0,1538.0,Interviewer,So what works?
1538.0,1568.0,Subject,"Being conservative and humble works. Understanding that everybody has their own opinion. Whether you agree with it or not, it is their opinion and you have to be able to respect their opinion. Because not everybody thinks or has been in the same situation as you have. Not everyone can look through the same perspective that you can and you have to be able to understand that."
1568.0,1572.0,Interviewer,And understanding that gets you what?
1572.0,1615.0,Subject,"Gets you understanding. Understanding that brings you to the point where you can easily relate with people or you can easily persuade people without offending people. Because no one wants to hear why your opinion is more important. No. What everyone wants to hear is, hey, you make a very good point. But have you ever looked at it from this standpoint?"
1615.0,1618.0,Interviewer,And is this something that you find you use often?
1618.0,1620.0,Subject,Absolutely. Every day.
1620.0,1621.0,Interviewer,Every day.
1621.0,1632.0,Subject,You know how many people live in New York? You know how many different people you come into-- how many different people you encounter in a day?
1632.0,1635.0,Interviewer,Would you persuade them all?
1635.0,1642.0,Subject,Any individual that might need persuading. You don't just walk around persuading people.
1642.0,1645.0,Interviewer,So who needs persuading?
1645.0,1678.0,Subject,"Doesn't matter. Whether it be a taxi cab trying to figure out if he should go down Bruckner Boulevard or go around through Home Street up to 174, or a little old man who can't decide whether he wants to go to the bakery or Dunkin' Donuts. Doesn't really matter. All depends on the situation."
1678.0,1686.0,Interviewer,So your persuasion in those contexts-- why?
1686.0,1701.0,Subject,Why? Because everyone else seems to ignore those contacts. Everyone acts like there isn't somebody standing right in front of them that obviously needs help.
1701.0,1702.0,Interviewer,Needs help?
1702.0,1727.0,Subject,"Yeah. He wouldn't be there lost, trying to figure out what he wanted if he didn't need any help. If he knew what he wanted, he'd go get it. It takes two seconds to see somebody that needs help. Takes another two seconds to go help them or it takes two seconds to walk away. Everything can happen in two seconds."
1727.0,1732.0,Interviewer,"So every day, you see people who need help?"
1732.0,1743.0,Subject,"No, not every day. But if it happens, it happens. You don't turn away from it. Because if you turn away from it, just like everybody else."
1743.0,1745.0,Interviewer,Everybody?
1745.0,1755.0,Subject,"Well, I don't want to-- no, not everybody else. Excuse me. You're absolutely right. Not everybody else. Majority of the people will."
1755.0,1758.0,Interviewer,Majority? Okay.
1758.0,1773.0,Subject,"How often do you see somebody asking for a quarter in front of a train station? And how often do you somebody walk by them? Out of 10 people that you see walk by, how many people do you see reach into their pocket and give them a quarter?"
1773.0,1775.0,Interviewer,A few.
1775.0,1777.0,Subject,Very few.
1777.0,1779.0,Interviewer,Is that the only way to help?
1779.0,1787.0,Subject,No. Absolutely not. All depends on the situation.
1787.0,1789.0,Interviewer,But that's how you help?
1789.0,1794.0,Subject,I help however I can.
1794.0,1798.0,Interviewer,This does keep coming up. Why do you think that's so important?
1798.0,1811.0,Subject,Because no one helped me. So I know what it is to need help and have nobody there. I know what it is to ask for help and have people turn a cheek on you.
1811.0,1817.0,Interviewer,So you asked for help? Do you mind me asking from who?
