1.0,5.0,Interviewer,So the first question that I'll ask you is how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,21.0,Subject,I'm okay. I've just been working on my portfolio and applying the jobs and stuff.
21.0,25.0,Interviewer,Awesome. So what kind of portfolio are you putting together?
25.0,28.0,Subject,Graphic design.
28.0,35.0,Interviewer,"Oh, cool. Can you talk a little bit about what kind of work you're doing?"
35.0,49.0,Subject,"Just like posters and some logos and stuff like that, just making a bunch of logos for a book."
49.0,50.0,Interviewer,For a book?
50.0,70.0,Subject,"Yeah, just put logos from A to Z but like six different A's, and then for every letter, six different types of logos for each letter."
70.0,71.0,Interviewer,That's a lot of work.
71.0,77.0,Subject,"Yeah, but it's always good practice for me, I think."
77.0,81.0,Interviewer,So that's 6 times 26. That's a lot of logos.
81.0,83.0,Subject,"Yeah, 156."
83.0,89.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you know what exactly they're for?
89.0,96.0,Subject,"No. No, it's just like practice."
96.0,101.0,Interviewer,And how did you come to start that project?
101.0,126.0,Subject,"Well, I started just doing the first letter, and then after I did the first page, I was like, ""I should just do it for every letter,"" and then I just started doing that. I have S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z. That's all I have left, nine letters."
126.0,133.0,Interviewer,So you're pretty far along. And what made you start?
133.0,162.0,Subject,"Just thinking that I wanted to have a book that I can show to clients or people who want logos. I can show them something that I did, show them examples, and then they can look through it and then see if they like any, and then I can design a logo for them based off that."
162.0,172.0,Interviewer,Okay. So what kind of people generally look for a logo? Who would your clients be?
172.0,177.0,Subject,"Well, I don't know. I don't really have any, so."
177.0,179.0,Interviewer,But who are you targeting?
179.0,180.0,Subject,Like at anyone. Like corporations. Yeah.
180.0,192.0,Interviewer,Okay. Cool. And how did you get into graphic design?
192.0,242.0,Subject,"In middle school I started making stickers. Ever since then I was pretty much into it. Yeah. I was just into making graffiti stickers and stuff like that, but then I went to school for graphic design, and then they told me that I should do fine arts instead, but I still wanted to-- I still wanted to [create design?] for this. I don't know. I don't know. I just always liked it."
242.0,248.0,Interviewer,"Why do you think they told you to go for fine arts, then?"
248.0,255.0,Subject,I think it was because I just used paint stuff.
255.0,256.0,Interviewer,Paint?
256.0,262.0,Subject,"Yeah. I used to just paint even where I wasn't supposed to be painting, I guess."
262.0,264.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] a new thing.
264.0,270.0,Subject,"Just like anything I thought would be cool, I guess. Yeah."
270.0,273.0,Interviewer,And what's in the greatest hits?
273.0,287.0,Subject,I don't know. I don't really have any. I painted the pope.
287.0,288.0,Interviewer,Really?
288.0,291.0,Subject,Yeah.
291.0,301.0,Interviewer,That's cool. What inspired that painting?
301.0,320.0,Subject,"Someone was handing out one of those fake magazines that had conspiracies on it, and it had a picture of the pope doing something with his hands like this, and then I wanted to paint that."
320.0,334.0,Interviewer,So you always stuck with graphic design. Why do you think you're most drawn to that?
334.0,365.0,Subject,"I think it was-- I think it was because of a video game I played when I was younger. Yeah. That was about graffiti, and I really liked it, and then it got me into doing it, and then I started making stickers after that."
365.0,368.0,Interviewer,How do you make a sticker?
368.0,391.0,Subject,"I just design it on the computer and-- well, in middle school I used to just buy full-sheet labels, so it's like a paper like this, but it's like a giant label. And I could just print out rows of stickers and then just cut them out."
391.0,394.0,Interviewer,That's awesome. I didn't know they had that.
394.0,407.0,Subject,Yeah. But then I started just making the design and then ordering vinyl stickers online.
407.0,409.0,Interviewer,You order vinyl stickers?
409.0,415.75,Subject,"You're basically just like with regular stickers. I mean, I don't know [inaudible]."
415.75,416.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] sticker [inaudible].
416.0,425.0,Subject,"I have some here, actually. It's just like this-- it's just like this vinyl."
425.0,430.0,Interviewer,"That's awesome. Oh, they're so cool. Did you make that?"
430.0,431.0,Subject,Yeah.
431.0,445.0,Interviewer,"Very cool. And so do you have formal training, or are you kind of self-taught?"
445.0,451.0,Subject,"I guess I'm self-taught. I guess, yeah."
451.0,455.0,Interviewer,Have you ever taken any classes?
455.0,463.0,Subject,"Yeah. I went to college for graphic design, but I didn't graduate, though. I only went for like a year."
463.0,465.0,Interviewer,Did you like it?
465.0,467.0,Subject,"No, not really."
467.0,469.0,Interviewer,Why not?
469.0,480.0,Subject,"I don't think the teachers were good. I don't think I had any good teachers, I mean. But yeah. And it also got-- it was also too expensive."
480.0,490.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I bet. It sounds like a very expensive-- but it's probably a [inaudible] job market [inaudible]."
490.0,495.0,Subject,"Well, that's why I started working on my portfolio."
495.0,506.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What made you feel that the teachers weren't very good?
506.0,533.0,Subject,"Because I wasn't really learning stuff that I wanted to learn. I feel like if I was to stay in school then that's-- I mean, I feel like I should only go to school if I wanted to be a teacher, like a art teacher in the future or something, but I didn't necessarily need that for what I wanted to do."
533.0,534.0,Interviewer,Which is work for a private client?
534.0,547.0,Subject,"Yeah. The stuff I want to do, I can just learn. I can learn and teach myself."
547.0,550.0,Interviewer,"How do you learn, then?"
550.0,589.0,Subject,"Well, I can look online, and then sometimes I just look on E Tube and look for different techniques I can use that I didn't know about and explore the programs like Illustrator and stuff and see all the stuff I can do with it and then just play around with that, and then just learn all the fundamentals and the history on E Tube and stuff, basically anything that interests me."
589.0,596.0,Interviewer,Fine. Is there a lot of history?
596.0,625.0,Subject,"I guess so. I haven't found a good video about that, or I haven't found a good video about the history of it. But it's basically just comes from fine art and Russian--"
625.0,626.0,Interviewer,Fine art? What's that?
626.0,654.0,Subject,"Fine art like a few of those-- a few of those-- I forgot, but another word like the eras, fine art, like cubism and stuff and constructivism or something, stuff like that."
654.0,664.0,Interviewer,Cool. Graphic design itself must be a relatively new field. Is it? I don't know.
664.0,681.0,Subject,"I guess relatively new, but I think it's starting to-- during like a Russian revolution or something."
681.0,684.0,Interviewer,Really?
684.0,709.0,Subject,"Well, I feel like the most impacts [inaudible] movements, I guess, of modern design with the Russian posters. I forget what they're called. I think it's constructivism or something. I don't know. I forgot the word."
709.0,715.0,Interviewer,Was it from the [inaudible]?
715.0,729.0,Subject,"I'm not sure. I mean, possibly, because they all used it, all sides of the movement, I guess, and the workers and stuff."
729.0,734.0,Interviewer,That's so interesting.
734.0,748.0,Subject,"But their stuff was just like a lot of red, a lot of geometric shapes and stuff."
748.0,750.0,Interviewer,Is there a reason?
750.0,782.0,Subject,"I guess because it just stands out more, and I guess it's more simplified than regular painting and stuff. I guess yeah, it's easier to paint, I guess, because they didn't have computers and Illustrator and stuff, Photoshop."
782.0,792.0,Interviewer,And I guess it's more for the people than art. I guess people have always had family crests or something that are relatively like a logo crest.
792.0,794.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
794.0,802.0,Interviewer,"But those were probably commissioned, I guess, that I think [inaudible]."
802.0,804.0,Subject,"Oh, I don't know."
804.0,820.0,Interviewer,"That's awesome. So graphic design has always kind of been a thing, ever since middle school. What else do you find interesting? What do you like with your time?"
820.0,833.0,Subject,"Well, recently, that's what I've been focusing on, but in the past, I've done music."
833.0,838.0,Interviewer,What kind of music are you into?
838.0,865.0,Subject,"I like hip-hop, electronic music, all of this. I mean, I like punk music. I feel I've been into every type of music movement, but I haven't really been listening to music a lot recently. I've just been focusing on art."
865.0,867.0,Interviewer,They don't go together?
867.0,882.0,Subject,"Well, they do, but I haven't been musically inspired to actually work on a new project."
882.0,887.0,Interviewer,"So you didn't only listen to music. Do you play anything, or--?"
887.0,903.0,Subject,"I just had the-- I just play it with a keyboard, but I didn't know the piano or anything. I didn't have any lessons or anything."
903.0,907.0,Interviewer,How did you play around with it? Did you play anything?
907.0,919.0,Subject,"Yeah, I mean, I made probably over 500 beats."
919.0,920.0,Interviewer,What?
920.0,927.0,Subject,"In my life. A lot. Well, I don't know if it's that much, but probably over 100."
927.0,933.0,Interviewer,That's great that you-- so can you walk me through that process?
933.0,992.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, I have this program called Logic Pro, and it's basically just like a music production software for MacBooks. And I would just make music that I would want to listen to or that people can rap over or something or sing over. And I made a few albums, and yeah. But it definitely ties in with graphic design because I'll usually make the music off a image. So I would have the cover, like the album art first, and then I would make the music based off that."
992.0,994.0,Interviewer,That's so interesting.
994.0,1009.0,Subject,"Yeah. Or if I didn't like it after, the album art, then I would just listen to it and then make a new cover based off what I'm hearing, like what good [inaudible]."
1009.0,1039.0,Interviewer,"So it was like it's visual first and then the music. That's really interesting. Because I feel like most musicians-- the cover is like an afterthought. It's like, ""Well, we're going to slap on the cover, and that's it."" Very cool. So you haven't been listening to much music. What kind of jobs are you applying to?"
1039.0,1077.0,Subject,The last one I applied to was an internship at a art gallery and then a internship at a graphic design agency. But I think it was like-- but I haven't got any response [inaudible]. That was just for all the work I did. I haven't sent anyone my new portfolio yet.
1077.0,1087.0,Interviewer,"What would your job consist of at the [inaudible] folks, so at the art gallery?"
1087.0,1115.0,Subject,"I don't know. I think it would just be just like whatever they need help with or something, but when I went to the interview, they asked me what my main focus was, and I said graphic design. So then they asked for my portfolio, and then I had to make one after that. That's why I started working on it, actually, and then, yeah."
1115.0,1117.0,Interviewer,Did you end up sending it?
1117.0,1127.0,Subject,"Yeah, I sent it, but it was just like a Wordpress citing [inaudible] link in like a few days, and it wasn't that good."
1127.0,1140.0,Interviewer,"Oh, I'm sorry. [inaudible]. So it seems like the graphic design agency is probably more up your alley."
1140.0,1148.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, yeah. At least that one responded to me."
1148.0,1156.0,Interviewer,"Do you know what you-- would you get to work on any projects there, or would you kind of be like entry level?"
1156.0,1175.0,Subject,"I'm not sure. They just said they needed a design intern, and they weren't really specific with what they were looking for, so yeah."
1175.0,1183.0,Interviewer,"And if you could have any job fall into your lap, what would it be?"
1183.0,1189.75,Subject,Probably design a logo for a big company.
1189.75,1190.0,Interviewer,What? Oh.
1190.0,1221.0,Subject,"Or I mean, work for a good agency would be nice, just working for them, or just like getting a big client or something. I'd just like, yeah, someone liking my stuff and then asking for me to design their logos for them or something. Making a lot of money would be nice."
1221.0,1244.0,Interviewer,So what do you think is the next step for your art? So you really like creating logos. Are there other things that you think beyond that in graphic design that you'd want to do?
1244.0,1252.0,Subject,"Yeah, I mean, I've been making a lot of posters recently. Is that what you mean?"
1252.0,1254.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1254.0,1293.0,Subject,"Yeah, I mean, I can do posters, but basically if I would want to do a complete identity for a company, so I'd make the logo first, and then I would make a business card and then just maybe a sculpture out of the logo or something. Just I'd design it, not make it by hand, and then just see all the ways I can adapt that and then just present that to the company just like a big package."
1293.0,1300.0,Interviewer,"Nice. And so you said identity, create an identity for them. Is that what they call it?"
1300.0,1302.0,Subject,"That's what it's called, yeah."
1302.0,1309.0,Interviewer,That's crazy. I guess you don't know if [inaudible] unless you're in it.
1309.0,1312.0,Subject,Yeah.
1312.0,1324.0,Interviewer,Very cool. And is New York a big place for graphic design?
1324.0,1336.0,Subject,I think so. There's a few really famous agencies based in New York. Yeah.
1336.0,1348.0,Interviewer,"Is there anywhere else you can imagine going? If your dream job was offered to you in California, would you go?"
1348.0,1362.0,Subject,"Possibly, but I don't know. I don't know. I really like New York, so I'd really have to think about it, and I'd have to have-- they'd have to give me a place, too."
1362.0,1363.0,Interviewer,To live.
1363.0,1373.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't know if I can just do that. I would really have to think about it, yeah."
1373.0,1378.0,Interviewer,So what do you think you'd see in New York? Did you grow up here?
1378.0,1389.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, I just don't have money to move anywhere. [crosstalk]."
1389.0,1408.0,Interviewer,Fair enough. I don't know. What else is your-- what else do you do with your day?
1408.0,1428.0,Subject,"It really depends. If I have something planned, maybe I'll just visit my girlfriend or something and hang out with her."
1428.0,1431.0,Interviewer,Does she live far from you?
1431.0,1448.0,Subject,"She lives in the East Village, so kind of far, because I don't have-- it's just 45 minutes away, so it's not that far, but not close."
1448.0,1452.0,Interviewer,Do you do that a lot? Do you hang out with her a lot?
1452.0,1459.0,Subject,"Yeah, maybe once or twice a week."
1459.0,1464.0,Interviewer,And what kind of things do you guys do together?
1464.0,1488.0,Subject,"Well, just hang out and cook food and maybe go to all the parties and go to museums a lot."
1488.0,1493.0,Interviewer,Do you have a favorite museum to hit up?
1493.0,1506.0,Subject,"No, not since they made everything too expensive, because you have to pay now. Just [inaudible]."
1506.0,1512.0,Interviewer,"Oh, no. They try to say you have to pay, but at the Met, if you live in New York, you don't have to pay."
1512.0,1514.0,Subject,"No, I think they changed that."
1514.0,1516.0,Interviewer,"No, it's only for outsiders that have to pay."
1516.0,1517.0,Subject,For real?
1517.0,1528.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I think. I mean, that's the last I heard. But if you could go anywhere for free, what's your favorite?"
1528.0,1536.0,Subject,"Probably the Met, yeah."
1536.0,1546.0,Interviewer,"Yeah? There's so much there. Do you have any favorite sections, wings, floors?"
1546.0,1583.0,Subject,"I don't know. I really can't choose one. Oh, I want to say the Egypt section, but I also like just the sculptures and stuff, but I can't hardly remember what they're called."
1583.0,1589.0,Interviewer,And does she like to go? Is she also into art?
1589.0,1602.0,Subject,"I guess so. I don't know. I think she just wants to get me to be inspired, so that's why she'll go with me."
1602.0,1609.0,Interviewer,That's sweet. What is she doing?
1609.0,1617.0,Subject,She studies computer science lab at NYU.
1617.0,1621.0,Interviewer,You guys could be like a collaboration.
1621.0,1628.0,Subject,"Yeah, we're thinking about that, kind of like starting an agency or something."
1628.0,1635.0,Interviewer,Oh. Does she have any art background?
1635.0,1642.0,Subject,"No, I don't think so. I don't know."
1642.0,1646.0,Interviewer,How did you guys cross paths?
1646.0,1654.0,Subject,"We met at a concert in [Richmond?], and yeah."
1654.0,1659.0,Interviewer,What concert was it?
1659.0,1674.0,Subject,I forgot. I forgot what it was. I forgot who was playing or something. I think one of my friends was. He's deejaying.
1674.0,1688.0,Interviewer,"That's pretty cool. So a lot of your friends are pretty artistic, then. How do you get a job as a deejay?"
1688.0,1696.0,Subject,I don't know. I deejayed somewhere [inaudible] for $50.
1696.0,1697.0,Interviewer,Really?
1697.0,1699.75,Subject,"Yeah, but they didn't really give us a lot."
1699.75,1700.0,Interviewer,So--
1700.0,1722.0,Subject,"I mean, it went okay, but there was a lot of technical difficulties, and I didn't go to the thing - what was it called? - the rehearsal or whatever. I forgot what the word is."
1722.0,1724.0,Interviewer,Sound check [inaudible]?
1724.0,1753.0,Subject,"Yeah, I didn't go to that because it was all the way in Brooklyn, and I hate going there. I didn't want to just go there if it wasn't the day of the event, so I just showed up the day of, and then I just had-- my computer's really slow, so it was really loading a lot, and I don't think it happened the way we wanted to."
1753.0,1767.0,Interviewer,I feel like it's definitely harder than it looks to deejay. But how do you get--
1767.0,1787.0,Subject,"I don't know. You just have to-- I don't know. You really have to know music, I guess. I don't know."
1787.0,1797.0,Interviewer,"Like anything, so fade into each other-- I don't know, knowing when to switch it seems really hard. Did you have to do that?"
