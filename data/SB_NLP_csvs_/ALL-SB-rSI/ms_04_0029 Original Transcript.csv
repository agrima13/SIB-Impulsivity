1.0,5.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So I'm just going to start with how have things been going for you lately?
"
5.0,56.0,Subject,"Okay. I mean, yesterday, I was at school, and I found out that we have break this coming week instead of two weeks away, so that was a nice surprise. But, otherwise, I'm a little bit anxious because a teacher of ours is checking homework tomorrow, and he doesn't really check on a regular basis. So I'm behind on these few things, and so now I have to rush and make it up. So I'm a little bit anxious.
 So is it rolling? Is he going to check all of them?
 Well, he usually doesn't check homework. So then when he checks homework, well, he'll check a bundle of assignments, but not everything. But those few that-- I just [inaudible] of some. And I was going to just finish them over break, but I guess not, so [laughter]. He might not get to me tomorrow, but yeah.
"
56.0,57.0,Interviewer,"So what class is it?
"
57.0,57.75,Subject,"History.
"
57.75,58.0,Interviewer,"History?
"
58.0,86.0,Subject,"Yeah. So. And the assignments are fine. It's just doing them. And then plus being a senior and you feel like the senior [inaudible], not to the point where you don't do work because I do. But it's just being a bit more lenient, especially knowing this teacher. It's like, ""All right. Well, I'll do it, but maybe I won't finish it tonight. I'll do it the next night or push it to the weekend."" And I do do it, but yeah, so it's my own fault [laughter]. But yeah.
"
86.0,93.0,Interviewer,"Oh. I'm sure it'll work out. So is history a subject you like?
"
93.0,111.0,Subject,"I mean, it's interesting, but I don't find it, I guess, difficult. I mean, I guess it depends what we're learning because it's mostly comprehension of things that happened and why did they happen. So I mean, it is interesting. And we're working on an activity right now, so that's always fun.
"
111.0,112.0,Interviewer,"Activity?
"
112.0,131.0,Subject,"Well, we're in pairs for the most part. And we're working on these propaganda posters because we're looking at World War II and the civil rights movement. So it's kind of like an artistic activity. I mean, it's nice. It's a nice break from just taking notes. And yeah. 
"
131.0,133.0,Interviewer,"So do you like the group?
"
133.0,194.0,Subject,"Well, I'm just working with a friend of mine because it's mostly pairs. And so yeah, I mean, we're friends, so I obviously like working with her. But she's the type that always participates in class. And, obviously, over the course of the past several months, our teacher's gotten to know that. So he has a few favorites in our class, which is kind of annoying because it's so blatantly obvious. But whatever. And so, sometimes, she's a little bit overpowering, I think. But I think that could be in kind of any group because when you're working with someone, you want to make sure that you can contribute. But then, sometimes, maybe you just can't, and all the ideas are coming from the other person. But just because she's like that, it doesn't interfere with the way we get along. And it's sometimes. And it's just in history because he always kind of calls on the same people.
"
194.0,195.0,Interviewer,"But it's not affected your friendship?
"
195.0,232.0,Subject,"No. No. Because it's just in that class I might get a little bit annoyed. But it's, I think, also, at him, too, because you can almost predict like, ""Okay. He's going to call on that student and that student and that student,"" which is okay, but it's kind of almost like he's not valuing everyone equally. Yeah. At parent-teacher conferences, he's like, ""Oh, she's great and everything."" He was talking about me to my dad. And so I guess he does notice every individual, but it doesn't always feel like that. 
"
232.0,235.0,Interviewer,"So you said he notices you?
"
235.0,260.0,Subject,"Well, obviously, because I mean, you see the physical presence of the student. But he had things to say at the parent-teacher conference, and they were good things. So it just doesnâ€™t all-- it doesn't always feel like that because you can go in and kind of predict who he's going to call on, or he'll have the same person reading out loud and stuff like that, so. 
"
260.0,261.0,Interviewer,"Are are those things that you want to do that he does that?
"
261.0,281.0,Subject,"No, not necessarily. But it would just be nice to be a little more diverse in terms of [inaudible]. I do participate, but not that often. And I'll raise my hand. But it would almost be nice if-- I mean, I may not want to participate, but just call on me. 
"
281.0,282.0,Interviewer,"The option, right?
"
282.0,285.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, because I also have him as my chorus teacher, and so--
"
285.0,286.0,Interviewer,"Ah.
"
286.0,288.0,Subject,"--he kind of has favorites there, too, so.
"
288.0,289.0,Interviewer,"Oh, really? 
"
289.0,294.0,Subject,"So he's a good teacher, but it's kind of annoying that way, so. 
"
294.0,295.0,Interviewer,"So you do chorus?
"
295.0,302.75,Subject,"Yeah. I do chorus in school. And I've done that since 10th grade. 
"
302.75,303.0,Interviewer,"Really?
"
303.0,310.0,Subject,"Yeah. So we're working on a '50s medley right now, so that's pretty fun.
"
310.0,312.0,Interviewer,"What's in it?
"
312.0,321.0,Subject,"Well, there's only two songs so far. So there's Teenager in Love and then [we're working on?] Lollipop. But I love old music or '50s and '60s and '80s [crosstalk]. 
"
321.0,323.0,Interviewer,"Me, too. 
"
323.0,332.0,Subject,"So it's all good. And [inaudible] learning because I'm not always interested in the songs. But that's really fun, and so. Yeah. 
"
332.0,338.0,Interviewer,"All right. What made you join chorus?
"
338.0,366.75,Subject,"Well, I like to sing. So I like to sing around the apartment and everything and that. And at that point, I was also taking voice lessons. So I probably would've joined in 9th grade, but I was really, really nervous because you have to audition and everything. So I just waited till 10th grade. And there was another girl that was auditioning, and I just went with her. And I was like, ""Hey, can I go with you?"" And then I auditioned. So it's just I like singing. And it's much harder, though, singing with other people. 
"
366.75,367.0,Interviewer,"Oh, why?
"
367.0,381.0,Subject,"Well, because you have to match harmony and everything, and making sure you're hitting the right notes because you can't be off from what other people are singing, compared to just me singing at home. Yeah. 
"
381.0,383.0,Interviewer,"And are you a soprano or an alto?
"
383.0,397.0,Subject,"Sometimes, he'll put you in different groups, so you'll be in-- I'm a soprano. But I know last year or the year before, I was in second soprano for songs and that. But right now, I'm just in the sopranos for what we're doing. 
"
397.0,400.0,Interviewer,"So it's a pretty big group if you have the second sopranos.
"
400.0,402.75,Subject,"Well, it's hard. 
"
402.75,403.0,Interviewer,"[crosstalk].
"
403.0,429.0,Subject,"Well, it's hard because we have it during lunch. So it's always kind of getting everyone there. But it's not too big, actually. Today, we had five people on the sopranos, well, six. Three of them-- well, five, and then three of them were in second. And they had five altos and two people in the tenor/bass section. So I'd say at the most, maybe 15.
"
429.0,430.0,Interviewer,"That's good. [crosstalk].
"
430.0,465.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, it's small, but it can also be big, too. When we do performance, it's big because the stage is really small, so yeah. But it's nice. It's fine. I mean, I was waiting for the senior class last year to leave because there were so many seniors in it last year. And literally, all their seniors, or most of them, were his favorites. And I don't think I'm a favorite, but that's fine. But it's a little bit more pared down now. So I think it's a little bit more equal kind of playing field, or it feels more comfortable kind of.
"
465.0,467.0,Interviewer,"More comfortable?
"
467.0,485.0,Subject,"Well, comfortable-- I don't know. I guess because I didn't-- maybe comfortable's not the right word. I don't know. I don't know. It's different, obviously, because those people left. I don't know.
"
485.0,490.0,Interviewer,"So what did they get? What does the favoritism get you in choir?
"
490.0,539.0,Subject,"Oh, well, I mean, it might not be favoritism, maybe, because, obviously, you want the best people that you have to kind of be forward, so. But a lot of them, I think, had been in chorus for a while. And so, again, it was like, ""Okay, well, we're going to give these people parts."" And then it wasn't even all the seniors, but certain seniors would get the solos or could almost be expected. So I think that's just like-- I don't know if he's aware because in 9th and 10th and 11th grades, I wouldn't really participate either, if at all. But they would call on a variety of people. So it was more of an inclusive thing during class. It's just what I noticed. I don't know if other people really--
"
539.0,540.0,Interviewer,"I'm sure they will.
"
540.0,543.0,Subject,"Yeah [laughter]. So I don't know.
"
543.0,546.0,Interviewer,"So you do it in your lunch period. When do you eat?
"
546.0,557.0,Subject,"Well, it's just Tuesdays and Wednesdays during lunch. And I go up to the cafeteria and eat and then I come down. And then you can also eat [inaudible]. Yeah. 
"
557.0,562.0,Interviewer,"So besides chorus and history, what fills your day?
"
562.0,565.0,Subject,"In terms of like a weekend day, or just a school day?
"
565.0,569.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. [inaudible]. 
"
569.0,616.0,Subject,"Well, okay. A weekend day, I usually get up later than when I go to school, obviously. And it depends. It depends if I'm just staying home for the day and I'll do, hopefully, some homework. I usually leave it till Sunday. But some homework or I'll go on the computer. And also my knitting club. So we're doing a knitting project, so I might knit. I don't read that much. I used to when I was younger. But it depends. Or if I'm seeing a friend, I'll go outside and go to her house. But the past two weeks, we've had movie night on Saturday, which is really fun. So we'll have dinner in front of the TV and we'll watch a James Bond movie. 
"
616.0,617.0,Interviewer,"Who's we?
"
617.0,619.0,Subject,"My dad and me. Yeah. Sorry. 
"
619.0,620.0,Interviewer,"You're all right. 
"
620.0,625.0,Subject,"And so that's fun. But on a school day--
"
625.0,632.0,Interviewer,"So which James Bond movie? Are you working your way from old ones to the new ones? 
"
632.0,655.75,Subject,"It depends. We're not going in an order. No. It's just whatever ones we get. Because we have a collection of them right now, but they're not necessarily in order. So two weeks ago, we watched one with Sean Connery, and then the following week, we watched one with Roger Moore, so. But they're all good. They can't really disappoint you because they're all good, so. 
"
655.75,656.0,Interviewer,"So you like them??
"
656.0,658.0,Subject,"Yeah. 
"
658.0,663.0,Interviewer,"Is that a genre you generally like?
"
663.0,666.0,Subject,"I'm just going to answer it. 
"
666.0,667.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. [crosstalk].
"
667.0,681.0,Subject,"[inaudible]. No, it's all good now. I don't really watch that many movies as I used to. So I guess it's [inaudible], it's action and romance, I guess. So sure. Yeah. 
"
681.0,684.0,Interviewer,"But it sounds like something you and your dad do quite often?
"
684.0,700.0,Subject,"Well, not really. I mean, it's just we had these two movies that we hadn't seen. And you can, obviously, [inaudible] movies. I guess not. But no, I don't really like-- the genre that I don't like is horror. 
"
700.0,701.0,Interviewer,"I can't do horror. 
"
701.0,712.0,Subject,"Yeah. And so I have a friend who really likes horror movies. And I've watched two of them with her. I mean, I don't know. It depends what you think horror is, but. 
"
712.0,714.0,Interviewer,"I have a pretty low threshold with horror. 
"
714.0,753.75,Subject,"Yeah. So. But I watched The Shining at home one time. But after you watched the movie, you realize it's not that bad. It's bad when you're watching it, but afterwards, you're like, ""It wasn't too gruesome."" It was more psychologically scary. Although when he's coming in trying to kill his wife, that's scary [laughter]. Okay. So yeah, it is scary, but it's a type of movie that if you were to watch it again, you would kind of know what to expect, I guess, although-- yeah. Yeah. You'd know what to expect. So it's not like hidden surprises. [crosstalk]--
"
753.75,754.0,Interviewer,"Just more [crosstalk]?
"
754.0,764.0,Subject,"Right. And so if I was watching it again, though, I might feel differently because when you're actually sitting there watching a movie [inaudible].
"
764.0,771.0,Interviewer,"So your friend, do you watch horror movies together [laughter]? [inaudible]?
"
771.0,832.0,Subject,"She's really into Broadway musicals, and so she'll enter the raffles. And so, sometimes, when she wins, she'll invite me. I'll go along. But I've known her parents for a long time because we went to elementary school together. We went to middle school together, as well. And so, years ago, I went upstate, and they had a family house there. And so we're close with them. Oh, I went to see the movie kind of horror Escape Room with her. So it's just different things. We went to this museum exhibit with my dad. Actually, so we don't go to the same school now, so we don't see each other as much. And I know her brother, as well. And I know her parents. And so I've been over to her house. She's been over to my house. And [inaudible] other family, and so yeah.
"
832.0,842.0,Interviewer,"I mean, those friendships, you can always form in high school, they still happen to [crosstalk]. It's really nice to have some people who are not in your current [crosstalk].
"
842.0,844.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's true.
"
844.0,851.0,Interviewer,"Knitting club. So what kind of things are you knitting?
 "
851.0,910.0,Subject,"So there's only me and two other students in the club. And then we have a teacher/supervisor. And so as far as I know, I haven't been doing a lot of knitting, but we didn't really do that much in the last few months. And so we've just started to knit scarves, which we're doing currently. We're going to donate them. Although the season's kind of wrapping up, but we're going to donate them either to this organization that we had emailed months ago. Or we're going to just throw them in the goodwill. So that's ultimately the end goal here. But the three of us get along really well. And then our teacher is really fun. So oftentimes, it turns into kind of a gossiping session [laughter]. But it's fun to go anyway, so. But yeah, [inaudible] tomorrow because our teacher was disappointed that we weren't further along, so. Yeah. But [crosstalk].
"
910.0,912.0,Interviewer,"What brought you to knitting club?
"
912.0,929.0,Subject,"Well, I think it might have been started last year. And a friend of mine was like, ""Oh, I'm going to knitting club today. Do you want to go?"" And so I went. And I hadn't been in years. And so the teacher taught us. And then yeah, so. 
"
929.0,933.0,Interviewer,"How did you learn to knit in the first place?
"
933.0,960.0,Subject,"We actually had knitting in elementary school. But these two women and my mom would come in sometimes. And they taught us how to knit in fourth grade. And so I think that was probably the first time. And then I didn't knit for a while either until 11th grade, so yeah. 
"
960.0,968.0,Interviewer,"Well, that's interesting that your mom and other parents came to school. 
"
968.0,981.0,Subject,"I would assume they were parents. It was two other women. Or this one other woman. No, I think it was two. So I think they might have been parents maybe of children in a younger grade or older. Yeah. No, it's interesting. 
"
981.0,982.0,Interviewer,"Well, I've never heard of that. 
 "
982.0,994.0,Subject,"Yeah. In third grade, my mom and this other mom of a kid in my class came in, and we did paper-mache globes, too. Yeah. 
"
994.0,996.0,Interviewer,"Wow. Very crafty mom.
"
996.0,1004.0,Subject,"Yeah [laughter]. So yeah. Yeah. I was in fourth grade [inaudible].
"
1004.0,1015.0,Interviewer,"And I mean, we don't have to talk about school more, but how was it transitioning to a different school from high school?
"
1015.0,1085.0,Subject,"It was good [laughter]. I mean, it was good. I have four other people from my middle school that are actually in my high school, and I'm close to two of them. And so kind of having them there, even though in the beginning, I wasn't close with any of them, but just having that familiar face. And then it was pretty much okay because, I guess, it's a middle school and a high school, so you have people that already know each other coming to ninth grade and also new people that don't. [inaudible]. Yeah. I mean, I really like my school because I have an IEP. So it's an individualized educational plan. And so the support has been really good, which is why I like it so much. And I've had IEP teachers in addition to the classroom teacher in every grade, and so I really like that. And I've never had an issue with them. And it's so supportive that that's why I like it. And it's comfortable going there because, obviously, it's like a routine and you're used to it. So when I go off to college, [crosstalk]--
"
1085.0,1086.0,Interviewer,"There we are. That's where we are. Yeah. 
"
1086.0,1113.0,Subject,"Yeah. It will be different. And so it's kind of getting near, feeling all melancholy because it's like oh, in the morning I come in and I wait in the hallway. And there's other kids waiting in the hallway. And you kind of know, okay, this person might be there today because it's the same kids waiting in the hallway, usually. But then after I'm going to go off to college, no more. So it's like the routine will be different, which is [inaudible].
"
1113.0,1122.0,Interviewer,"So just walk me through how the IEP works. Do you have separate teachers in addition to the classroom teacher?
"
1122.0,1126.0,Subject,"So I can just walk you through a school day?
"
1126.0,1127.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. 
"
1127.0,1164.0,Subject,"So I come in. You start with advisory and certain different advisories. And then you go to your first class. So if it's an academic class, I go. And there's four total sections in 12th grade. So you're either in 12 A, B, C, or D. And two of them, A and C, have IEP teachers. So that means when I'm in math class I have the math teacher and then I also have my math IEP teacher. So we have two teachers in that class. And the math IEP teacher is for all the IEP students as well as anybody who needs help. So it's just that extra person in the room, and he knows what we're learning, as well. 
"
1164.0,1169.0,Interviewer,"But there could be multiple people with IEPs who rely on that same person?
"
1169.0,1170.0,Subject,"Yeah. 
"
1170.0,1174.0,Interviewer,"And how does he help all of you [crosstalk]?
"
1174.0,1216.0,Subject,"Well, you rely on both teachers. So it's not like you would just go to him for help. But instead of just having one teacher in the room, you have two. So it benefits anybody in that class. He's not limited to just those people. And so yeah, it's just nice to have two. I can go to the main teacher or I can go to him. And then in English and history, I also have a different IEP teacher for those classes, so she's in there along with our main teacher. And again, you can ask for help from either one. So it's an advantage because you get two teachers instead of one. And then the other two sections just have the one. 
"
1216.0,1224.0,Interviewer,"So what is it for really? So when did you start having an IEP?
"
1224.0,1262.0,Subject,"I think I started it in fourth grade, although at the time, I wasn't really aware it was going on. And so the purpose, I mean, at that point it was to support me academically. Obviously, through the years-- we have an IEP meeting at the end of every year, and so it's been minimized as you need less and less of it. So yeah, that's the purpose, just if you need extra help on something, you have the IEP teacher. And he's really there for anyone in the class. Or you'll get extra time on certain things. 
"
1262.0,1265.0,Interviewer,"I got extra time [crosstalk]. 
"
1265.0,1288.0,Subject,"Yeah. Or for testing, we'll be taken out of the room and we'll go to this office, which is nice. But yeah, I know there's two students that have 504s, which is just extended time. But that's like when we do SAT testing, then they'll have extra time without the IEP. There is that, as well. 
"
1288.0,1295.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. What else did I have? So college is coming up. How are you making it through all the stress and the [crosstalk]?
"
1295.0,1346.0,Subject,"Actually, it's funny because it's like when we applied to middle school and high school, it's like, ""Oh, my God."" Everyone's so stressed. And the college experience, applying is supposed to be stressful, but it's not that stressful. Getting in the financial forms was kind of stressful in terms of meeting the deadlines, but it's more about worrying about getting into a college. And then when you do, it's all good. And then you just kind of wait to hear back. But I mean, I was nervous during the process because in terms of 11th grade, that was a hard year, just academically. So it was kind of the grades were dropped a little bit in certain classes. So it's kind of that's concerning. But it wasn't a deep drop. I mean, it was a drop from 10th grade, but I guess that didn't really impact it that much because I did get into--
"
1346.0,1347.0,Interviewer,"Plus you're in.
"
1347.0,1349.0,Subject,"Well, I got in to four. 
"
1349.0,1352.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my God [laughter]. All right. Wait, what month is this [laughter]?
"
1352.0,1371.0,Subject,"It's February. Yeah. February. But I think, with this one, I've applied to eight. And I have two more, actually, to apply to. But yeah, so I got into four already. So it covers it because you've gotten into school. 
"
1371.0,1373.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Really, you're done. 
"
1373.0,1376.0,Subject,"Yeah. So now it's fine kind of and--
"
1376.0,1377.0,Interviewer,"Congratulations. That's [inaudible].
"
1377.0,1378.0,Subject,"Thank you.  
"
1378.0,1381.0,Interviewer,"So that must have been early action or--
"
1381.0,1401.0,Subject,"Well, no, it was early action for one of them and then regular decision for the other three. But two of them were like, ""Okay, if you submit by a certain deadline, you get priority status. And we'll give you your decision quicker,"" and everything like that. And so two of them were quicker. And then the fourth one was really quick, so. 
"
1401.0,1408.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean, I feel like when we applied, it was May. It was like May 1. People were frightened if they're going to get [inaudible].
"
1408.0,1414.0,Subject,"Well, yeah, that's when you have to send in your deposit. So it was quite likely May 1st, then you're committed for sure. 
"
1414.0,1420.0,Interviewer,"Oh, maybe that was the committed date. So do you have a preference about which one you're going to--?
"
1420.0,1428.0,Subject,"Well, it depends on what the financial aid package is. But my preference right now is Ithaca College, so. 
"
1428.0,1430.0,Interviewer,"Nice. That's in New York, okay?
"
1430.0,1440.0,Subject,"Yeah. Five hours away, though. But it's New York. And so that's my preference. And I think I would go there, but we'll see. 
"
1440.0,1442.0,Interviewer,"So what makes it a [inaudible]?

1442.0,1493.0,Subject,"Well, we toured it in this past April. And so it was one of the first ones that we looked at for college, and then we looked at a bunch more afterwards. And so it kind of has always stuck out in my mind in terms of like, ""Hey, we saw all of these, but it's kind of still back to square one with this college."" So I don't know. I think it was more the feel and feeling comfortable. And I want to go into some aspect of business. And so they, obviously, have that. And yeah, I want to minor in French, and they have that, as well. So that was a must that they have French as a minor. But I mean, the town, it's kind of like a college town, too. It's nice. But I think, ultimately, it must have been the feel of the campus because that's where you kind of know where you want to go. So yeah. 
"
1493.0,1500.0,Interviewer,"[inaudible]. So business, how did you select business and French?
"
1500.0,1556.0,Subject,"I don't know [laughter]. Well, my dad is French, and so his side of the family is French. And so he speaks fluent French. And my grandma, obviously, speaks fluent French, but I don't. And we've tried, but I never went to a good dual language school where French was offered. Well, when I was really young, I did. So I never really learned it. And I'm totally not fluent in it. So I'd want to kind of go to college and minor in that and kind of get that squared away. And then that can potentially apply to any field you go into. And so I'm interested in business. I don't know where that interest came from in terms of going into business, but French would certainly apply there. And so that's what I'm thinking of, but most likely, I would go in as either undecided or undecided business major because I don't want to commit myself to something. So yeah. But that's what I'm thinking of. 
"
1556.0,1572.0,Interviewer,"At least at Ithaca-- I remember when I started college, we had a lot of preset classes we had to take just the first year. And I thought that that was really fine because I got to explore all these things that I would not have self-selected into.
 "
1572.0,1580.0,Subject,"Yeah, there probably is that. Because I think in usually every college, you don't declare a major until the second sophomore year. 
"
1580.0,1583.0,Interviewer,"Sophomore year. Yeah. 
"
1583.0,1603.0,Subject,"Although this might be slightly different because I think I was admitted into the business program or the business undecided major. I'd have to review that. But I would assume-- yeah, I would assume there's classes you have to take, obviously, to get [crosstalk].
"
1603.0,1607.0,Interviewer,"So did you apply to business specifically?
"
1607.0,1635.0,Subject,"Well, on the Common App, they ask your interest in major or major you're interested in studying. And so I think that was maybe pretty much for all colleges. And it might just have been on the Common App, which is sent to every college you apply to. So yeah, but I don't think you would have to declare it until the sophomore year because it seems like you'd be able to switch, maybe not for every single program. 
"
1635.0,1636.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. But--
"
1636.0,1641.0,Subject,"That's interesting, actually. Yeah. I'm not sure. Where do you go to college?
"
1641.0,1642.0,Interviewer,"Barnard. 
"
1642.0,1643.0,Subject,"Oh, okay.
"
1643.0,1674.0,Interviewer,"So it was very close. I'm also a New York City kid, and so, obviously, I didn't go very far [laughter]. But yeah, I liked Barnard. It was a really nice combination of small [inaudible]. Yeah. So well, you're really close to leaving. That's crazy. Are you excited to leave home, nervous?
"
1674.0,1713.75,Subject,"I'm more excited by the idea of living on my own. So this is even after college, but having my own apartment because as realistic as that is, and especially in New York City, if I was to come back here. But no, just in terms of being able to eat whatever I want. And I really like sweet stuff, so having different kind of cake and dessert mixes in my cabinet. So that's kind of exciting. But in terms of college, it'll probably be exciting to take classes that specifically go to your future. But I don't really think about it too much.
"
1713.75,1714.0,Interviewer,"Really?
"
1714.0,1743.0,Subject,"I mean, sometimes, but I don't have any strong feelings right now about it. It's, obviously, [inaudible], but when it gets closer, I'll have more of a definite feeling of sadness and maybe separation anxiety, although I don't think I've ever really had that. But definitely homesickness in the beginning, so. Yeah. And then you go from having your own room and your own bathroom to sharing your room and sharing--
"
1743.0,1744.0,Interviewer,"So there is definitely [crosstalk]?
"
1744.0,1776.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. And actually, I don't know if you can triple, but there's definitely doubles. We toured this college such a long time ago that you could maybe get a single-- sorry [laughter]. I can't even say it. No, but I think they usually are doubles. And then as you go up in terms of grade levels into sophomore year, you might have other options of [inaudible] you can house off-campus, but not the first year, so.
"
1776.0,1784.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I always found my freshman year, I was secretly grateful to have a roommate. I mean, if it was scary. 
"
1784.0,1785.0,Subject,"[inaudible] as long as you hopefully-- 
"
1785.0,1786.0,Interviewer,"I just want to know if they're--
"
1786.0,1791.0,Subject,"--get along with each other, as well.
"
1791.0,1793.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So are you an only child?
"
1793.0,1794.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. 
"
1794.0,1798.0,Interviewer,"Yes. So you're not used to sharing a room. Yeah. 
"
1798.0,1843.0,Subject,"And it would also be nice to have a roommate because I don't know who else from my school's applied there or has gotten in. And so if I don't know anybody, of course, it's nice to have that roommate, even if you're not that close, just someone you can kind of start the new year off with. And yeah, so. And nowadays, with technology and everything, it's so much more connected. And so they have the admitted students' day and like Facebook pages and stuff and I guess you can meet up with your roommate if you wanted to. And then you have the surveys, that way they can pair you with the best possible person. So yeah, I think [inaudible] will be interesting, so yeah. 
"
1843.0,1845.0,Interviewer,"Have you joined the Facebook pages yet?
"
1845.0,1848.0,Subject,"I have not because I have not chosen my school. 
"
1848.0,1852.0,Interviewer,"Right. But you know they can give you a good sense of the area?
"
1852.0,1857.0,Subject,"It could. But I think, actually, one of them was limited just for admitted students, yeah. 
"
1857.0,1858.0,Interviewer,"Oh, people who had accepted?
