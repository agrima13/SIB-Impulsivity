0.0,7.0,Interviewer,So the first thing I'll ask you is how have things been going for you lately?
7.0,17.0,Subject,"Well, I'm very excited that-- oops, I need to shut this off. Sorry."
17.0,19.0,Interviewer,Okay.
19.0,43.0,Subject,Okay. I've been very excited lately for the summer because I plan to do a lot of fun things and better myself as a person. And I'm just glad the stress of the school year is over. So things have been going well.
43.0,45.0,Interviewer,So are you done?
45.0,46.0,Subject,With school? Yeah.
46.0,47.0,Interviewer,Nice.
47.0,48.0,Subject,Completely done.
48.0,53.0,Interviewer,And what did you find stressful?
53.0,80.0,Subject,"Just managing the workload. I was so unmotivated most of the time to do my work, and I fell so far behind. And over the last few months, I've been trying to catch up. And it didn't really work out. And my grades were a lot lower than they could have been. But now it's over, and I have next year. And I'm looking forward to it."
80.0,90.0,Interviewer,Very cool. And why do you think that they dropped in [that way?]? Why do you think you weren't motivated?
90.0,124.0,Subject,"Well, maybe it's not that I wasn't motivated. But I had other things on my mind that I prioritize. And it was hard for me to really tell myself what was more important at what time. And all I want to do all day is dream and think about whatever I want to, and it really threw me off. And I could never really just say, ""You have to do this work."" It didn't work for me."
124.0,125.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
125.0,126.0,Subject,Yeah.
126.0,130.0,Interviewer,And what kind of things do you dream about?
130.0,167.0,Subject,"The future, where I'm going to be, what I'm going to do, how I'm going to be. And then I think about a lot of random things that I saw or heard [over?] the day. I think about someone a lot. I think about basketball a lot, but mostly just the future."
167.0,170.0,Interviewer,And what do you see in the future?
170.0,191.0,Subject,"I see myself being what I want to be, and I see myself being very successful and being a strong, positive influence to other people and living my best life."
191.0,194.0,Interviewer,And what is that?
194.0,206.0,Subject,"Well, I want to be a basketball player. And even though it's highly unlikely, it's still fun to dream about, so I do. Yeah."
206.0,208.0,Interviewer,And why basketball?
208.0,314.0,Subject,"That's a good question. I don't know. It's a new passion, I guess, I developed over the last year. I really don't know why I love it. I think it's because it's just such a good way to forget about things, I guess, and let loose and be yourself, and at the same time, you have fun. A lot of people look up to basketball players, and it's kind of inspiring.  And there are so many cool stories over the years of people whose lives were changed because of basketball. And I think it's just such a powerful sport, and it can change lives easier than other sports because other sports are a lot more expensive and take a lot more time to get better at. And I was always a baseball player, and that was always my dream. And then it kind of died out because I wasn't progressing the way I wanted to. And then I kind of just picked up basketball. And over a short period of time, I've developed a lot, and I think it was easier to pick up learning basketball than any other sport. Yeah."
314.0,324.0,Interviewer,That's awesome. And you said that it helps you forget about things. What did you mean?
324.0,363.0,Subject,"Well, not that my life is terrible because it's not. I have a nice family, and I go to a nice school, and I have good things. But sometimes I'm in a fight with myself because I'm not exactly who I want to be. So when I step onto a court or just watch basketball, I kind of just lose track of whatever is going on in the world and hop into this other world, and it's really fun to be in. And it makes me feel better."
363.0,367.0,Interviewer,And what do you mean you fight with yourself?
367.0,398.0,Subject,"Well, because I have ideas and goals of who I want to be, and I'm not exactly who I want to be. So that's kind of my biggest struggle, and that's the thing that puts me down the most in life. And when I'm playing basketball, I don't always really think about that. And I think that's one of the only ways to get me to not think about it, so."
398.0,405.0,Interviewer,And so what is-- how are you different from how you want to be?
405.0,420.0,Subject,"It's complicated. Do you want to me to describe what I want to be, or why I'm not what I want to be?"
420.0,421.0,Interviewer,Both.
421.0,501.0,Subject,"Both, okay. Well, I wish I were a lot bigger and stronger and faster, and I wish I were better at sports. I wish I looked different. I wish I were a lot taller. I wish I were more mature. And obviously, things could be a lot worse, but I always want more. And I think that's one of the hardest things for me to deal with because I'm never really happy with-- not happy. I'm never really satisfied with where I'm at, and sometimes it puts me down and then slows me down. So that's why I'm always trying to be who I want to be. But at the same time, it slows my life down because sometimes it demotivates me knowing that I'm not what I want to be. And then I kind of just sit at home and do nothing and just think, and that's not very productive, so."
501.0,515.0,Interviewer,"Okay. What do you think it means to be-- I mean, obviously, things like taller and stronger are one thing. But what do you think it means to be more mature like you said?"
515.0,556.0,Subject,"Sometimes I feel like I'm a little awkward or shy. And I'm not most of the time, but sometimes I have those moments. I wish I could just-- not that I'm not already, but I get along with people, and people like me. And I would say I'm popular. Not that that matters at school, but I wish I was the man, and everybody wanted to be me. I'm not there yet, maybe one day."
556.0,573.0,Interviewer,"Maybe one day. Very cool. So besides basketball, what's going on?"
573.0,582.0,Subject,What is going on socially or mentally?
582.0,586.0,Interviewer,Both.
586.0,618.0,Subject,"Well, I have most-- not most of my friends. Some of my friends will be here the whole summer, but I don't really want to spend time with friends this summer. I kind of want to just wait for next year because I really need stay focused on myself these next two months and not waste any time. There's a few people I'll make exceptions for, but that's it."
618.0,620.0,Interviewer,Like who?
620.0,660.0,Subject,"Well, there's one person who means a lot to me, but they're going to Brazil for most of the summer. That's where they're from. And I guess it's going to be good for me because I won't be very distracted. Yeah. I'll get to really lock in the next two months without any distractions, I think."
660.0,664.0,Interviewer,And so what's your plan?
664.0,724.0,Subject,"Well, I plan to play basketball from anywhere between eight and nine hours a day. I plan to be going to the gym, working out three, four times a week. I plan to go to the beach a lot. I plan to eat healthier. I know everybody has all these goals, but I think I can really achieve them. And I would say my whole life, I've been more of a talker than a doer, but I think I can change that this summer. And I really want to be the best version of myself I can be. And I know I'm young. I'm running out of time before college. I get older, and I have to really take advantage of two months of freedom. Yeah."
724.0,731.0,Interviewer,Yes. Yeah. School is a blessing with a vacation time.
731.0,732.0,Subject,Yeah.
732.0,738.0,Interviewer,So what do you mean you've been more of a talker than a doer?
738.0,755.0,Subject,"I always say I'm going to do all these things and be this, be that, and then I never really take action. And I did that when it came to school. I did that when it came to being active and all that. Yeah. Yup."
755.0,757.0,Interviewer,Being active?
757.0,772.0,Subject,"With basketball and working out in general, I've set really high goals and didn't really follow through on them. Yeah."
772.0,780.0,Interviewer,Okay. So this year was stressful. It's over.
780.0,781.0,Subject,Yeah.
781.0,788.0,Interviewer,You have a plan for this summer. And what about next year?
788.0,835.0,Subject,"Well, I will see where I'm at after the summer. But if I'm where I want to be at the end of the summer or anywhere close to where I want to be at the end of the summer, I feel like I will have developed enough to do better in school. Because all this is building discipline, better habits, and I guess I could just carry that momentum or whatever it is into school year and be a better student and just be who I want to be. So my plans are to use this summer to be who I want to be next year. And if I'm not, then just keep trying."
835.0,846.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So besides basketball, are you going to be a senior next year?"
846.0,847.0,Subject,Yeah.
847.0,849.0,Interviewer,So are you excited?
849.0,850.0,Subject,No.
850.0,851.0,Interviewer,No?
851.0,853.0,Subject,I don't want high school to end.
853.0,854.0,Interviewer,Really
854.0,856.0,Subject,Yeah.
856.0,857.0,Interviewer,Why not?
857.0,862.0,Subject,"Because I like the people there, and I like being a kid."
862.0,863.0,Interviewer,Being a kid.
863.0,869.0,Subject,Yeah. I don't want to be in college.
869.0,872.0,Interviewer,Do you know why?
872.0,928.0,Subject,"Because I feel like I grew up really fast. And it's just I don't really want to restart and make new friends and all that. I just want to-- I really hope next year goes by slowly. Yeah. Because I really enjoy the people I go to school with. And even just seeing people who I'm not friends with, acquaintances, that means a lot to me too. And it's just something I don't want to move away from. The best year of my life was fifth grade. And that was almost seven years ago, and it feels like a lot less. So I feel like I've really grown up fast, and I'm not ready to move on to be an adult. I still feel really young."
928.0,932.0,Interviewer,Why was fifth grade the best year?
932.0,990.0,Subject,"I had class, basically, with every single one of my best friends in elementary school except for two. And it was my favorite teacher. We moved to a new building that year, and it was really, really nice. It was brand new. And there were no real consequences or anything.  We kind of just did whatever we wanted to. Yeah. It was just I felt so old and on top of the school, and it was a really good feeling. And I just had fun every day. And there was really nothing to worry about, fortunately, at the time. Yeah. That's why it was the best year."
990.0,994.0,Interviewer,Do you feel like there's more to worry about now?
994.0,1033.0,Subject,"Yeah. Because as you get closer to being an adult, you have more responsibility. Not that it's something I can't handle, but you just have more things to be on top of. And you have to worry more about your future. You just have to think more about it, about what you want to do, what you want to be, where you see you see yourself going to college, all that, having great grades, so. Yeah."
1033.0,1040.0,Interviewer,And it seems like the idea of being an adult is not appealing to you.
1040.0,1045.0,Subject,Not yet. One day it is. Not yet.
1045.0,1048.0,Interviewer,And why do you think that is?
1048.0,1050.0,Subject,Because I grew up fast [laughter].
1050.0,1051.0,Interviewer,What does that mean?
1051.0,1095.0,Subject,"That means time went by really fast from the time I was a little kid to now. Maybe that's just because I have a really good memory going back to when I was a little kid, and I can remember things from 10-plus years ago really easily. And just to think I'm here now and one year away from college is kind of scary, and I'm just not ready for it. It's just I loved being a kid, and I just don't want to be an adult yet. I can't really explain it."
1095.0,1107.0,Interviewer,That's fair. Is there anything that you are excited about for college?
1107.0,1138.0,Subject,"I guess being an adult and having freedom. And that's contradicts everything I just said. But once you're there, you kind of just deal with it. And at that point, once you have to become an adult, I think it would be fun. And having freedom to do whatever I want-- I mean, not living with my parents, that kind of freedom. Yeah."
1138.0,1139.0,Interviewer,And do you think living with your--?
1139.0,1142.0,Subject,That's what I would look forward to. What?
1142.0,1146.0,Interviewer,Do you think living with your parents is very restricting?
1146.0,1166.0,Subject,"No. Because they give me a fair amount of freedom, but at the same time, I wish I lived alone. There's lot of reasons I wish I lived alone. Should I name a few?"
1166.0,1167.0,Interviewer,Please.
1167.0,1244.0,Subject,"Okay. One reason is because I feel like my family doesn't really know anybody in my life except for my elementary school friends and someone from middle school. So I don't really ever have anyone over because it just would feel kind of weird, and I don't really want my family to be part of my social life. And if I had lived on my own, I can have anybody over whenever. It would be nice. And I wish I lived alone because-- I have a nice, small apartment, and it's comfortable. But I wish it was designed my way, I guess. I'm very obsessive over small details, I guess. And I just wish I had my own place that I could make look like the way I want it to. I mean, I know that's not a very big issue. There's bigger things to be worried about in life, but this is [inaudible]."
1244.0,1248.0,Interviewer,So what kind of small details do you get obsessed about?
1248.0,1251.0,Subject,In my house?
1251.0,1252.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm.
1252.0,1263.0,Subject,"The way the furniture is organized, the kind of furniture. Yeah, just small things like that."
1263.0,1273.0,Interviewer,And you said that you didn't really want your family to be a part of your social life. Do you know why that is?
1273.0,1329.0,Subject,"I have no clue. It's something I started feeling in eighth grade as I hit puberty. So maybe that's why. I don't know. It's a coincidence. Yeah, not that I'm embarrassed of them. They're fine. I don't really have anything to be embarrassed about. It's just as I've gotten older, I've started to develop this feeling that family is supposed to be separate from friends, and my home is my private place. And my family are like-- it's just something I want to keep private, to myself, I guess."
1329.0,1334.0,Interviewer,And would you say you're particularly close with your family?
1334.0,1382.0,Subject,"No. Because I don't really tell them-- I don't really tell them anything, but I know they care about me, so. But we don't have close relationships. We have relationships where - what's the word? - I guess here's unconditional love, but that doesn't mean we're close or friendly. At times, we are, maybe when my dad and I watch football games. Sometimes when we go out to dinner every once in a while as a family, I'll feel close, but otherwise, no."
1382.0,1394.0,Interviewer,"And who do you think is the person that you-- or people you share the most with, that you do have that kind of connection with?"
1394.0,1396.0,Subject,"Not family, anybody?"
1396.0,1398.0,Interviewer,Anybody.
1398.0,1404.0,Subject,So my best friend?
1404.0,1406.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1406.0,1451.0,Subject,"I don't really have one. I have a lot of good friends. I have groups of friends too. I have my elementary school friends who I'm not going to get personal with, but we'll always have a fun time together. And then I have someone who I'm really close with from middle school, and we've had a very interesting friendship, I guess, over the last three, four years. And then there's my close friends from high school who I probably open up to the most. Yeah."
1451.0,1454.0,Interviewer,And what do you open up to them about?
1454.0,1476.0,Subject,"I don't know, just about what's going on but only if it comes up. I don't really put any of my thoughts out there. I don't tell anybody everything. I kind of keep most things to myself except for one person who I'm not afraid to tell anything to, so."
1476.0,1480.0,Interviewer,And what makes that person different?
1480.0,1520.0,Subject,"Because we have history, but I think this person and have unconditional love and support for each other no matter what. And it all almost has a separate meaning to me than anybody else. It does have a separate meaning to me than anyone else."
1520.0,1526.0,Interviewer,And is that something that you-- do you enjoy opening up to them?
1526.0,1539.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's pretty easy. Even though they don't always care or listen, I still do."
1539.0,1540.0,Interviewer,So sometimes you feel like they don't care.
1540.0,1542.0,Subject,No.
1542.0,1544.0,Interviewer,What gives you that impression.
1544.0,1545.0,Subject,I just know.
1545.0,1546.0,Interviewer,You know.
1546.0,1547.0,Subject,Yeah.
1547.0,1550.0,Interviewer,How?
1550.0,1568.0,Subject,Just because of the responses sometimes. I can just tell based on that.
1568.0,1588.0,Interviewer,"Okay. And so if some of the responses aren't always caring as you said, then describe to me the unconditional support and love."
1588.0,1602.0,Subject,"Well, because this person knows I'm always going to be there, and I think that's why. Yeah."
1602.0,1604.0,Interviewer,And you feel that they're always there for you.
1604.0,1615.0,Subject,"No. But knowing that I'm always there for them, knowing that they know that, then that's enough."
1615.0,1618.0,Interviewer,What makes that enough?
1618.0,1627.0,Subject,"Because I know I'll never be forgotten by them, so."
1627.0,1631.0,Interviewer,Why does that matter to you?
1631.0,1636.0,Subject,Because I don't want to be forgotten. I can't explain it.
1636.0,1642.0,Interviewer,Why would they forget you anyway?
1642.0,1659.0,Subject,Because we've kind of gone our own ways. We don't see each other often. Yeah.
1659.0,1662.0,Interviewer,When?
1662.0,1679.0,Subject,"Very different people go to different schools, and she has different interests than I do sometimes. Yeah. That's it."
1679.0,1682.0,Interviewer,Different interests?
1682.0,1687.0,Subject,Do you want me to go into detail?
1687.0,1689.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1689.0,1742.0,Subject,"Her ideas of fun are a little different than mine sometimes even though [they're?] starting to change a little. Just the things I wish we could do are not really always what she wants to do, so we kind of always just do whatever she wants to do. That's fine with me. But my interests are very adventurous, being outdoors and doing fun things together. And her interests are drugs or just staying at home. Yeah."
1742.0,1746.0,Interviewer,So you're not interested in--
1746.0,1755.0,Subject,"No. It's not that I'm not, but she's over the top. And I'm [inaudible]."
1755.0,1763.0,Interviewer,Fair enough. Do you think that's affected you a lot?
1763.0,1768.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah."
