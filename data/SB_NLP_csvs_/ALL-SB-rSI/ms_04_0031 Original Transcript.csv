0.0,6.0,Interviewer,"So I'll just start with asking how have things been going for you lately?
"
6.0,7.0,Subject,Great some days.
7.0,8.0,Interviewer,Some days?
8.0,11.0,Subject,Yeah.
11.0,14.0,Interviewer,And so what does good look like?
14.0,17.0,Subject,"I don't know. Just a perfect day, I guess?"
17.0,19.0,Interviewer,And what's a perfect day?
19.0,28.0,Subject,"No stress, being able to get things done. I don't know."
28.0,33.0,Interviewer,So what generally do you find stressful?
33.0,39.0,Subject,I really don't know. It depends.
39.0,45.0,Interviewer,And what kind of things do you like getting done?
45.0,50.0,Subject,"Chores, going out, shopping, stuff like that."
50.0,56.0,Interviewer,So what do you normally do when you go out?
56.0,66.0,Subject,"Go out with friends, eat, chat, talk about life, set goals. I don't know."
66.0,72.0,Interviewer,And what kind of goals are you setting?
72.0,95.0,Subject,"Long term goals, where I want to be in next couple years. These last couple months have been stressful. You can tell my voice-- sometimes it comes in, sometimes I lose it and I talk weird. This started a couple months ago so I'm just trying to figure out why all this is happening."
95.0,98.0,Interviewer,So it was a couple months ago. It's pretty recent.
98.0,99.0,Subject,Yeah.
99.0,102.0,Interviewer,"Do you have any ideas? 
"
102.0,108.0,Subject,"I don't know. Maybe anxiety, depression triggered it. I don't know."
108.0,111.0,Interviewer,Have you been feeling [inaudible]?
111.0,149.0,Subject,"On and off. I work for Mount Sinai and I got promoted for a job. I was in a relationship but it didn't work out. I think some might say that triggered the anxiety and the depression. I've never known to have anxiety or be depressed. Not like this, but I don't know. And here we are. [inaudible] almost every doctor to figure out what's going on. And my doctor recommended me to come here and do this."
149.0,154.0,Interviewer,So what kind of doctors have you seen?
154.0,165.0,Subject,Psychiatrist. She's the one that told me to come here. And just a neurologist. Yeah.
165.0,171.0,Interviewer,"And so you got a promotion. That sounds-- 
"
171.0,185.0,Subject,"Yeah. It was nice at first, but I haven't been to work in a while because of all this. I've collapsed a couple times.  
"
185.0,186.0,Interviewer,Collapsed?
186.0,200.0,Subject,"Like walking and then I just fall to the ground because of muscle weakness. Just a whole bunch of stuff that didn't happen prior to all these things.  
"
200.0,220.0,Interviewer,"That sounds really scary. Why do you think those two things that you mentioned, the promotion and then your relationship not working out, may have contributed to this?"
220.0,222.0,Subject,"I don't know, maybe fear."
222.0,223.0,Interviewer,Fear?
223.0,240.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't know. Since I'm a perfectionist, I like to make sure everything is right. And I think things went too far, making sure everything is right."
240.0,243.0,Interviewer,What do you mean too far?
243.0,267.0,Subject,"I guess, with any task I overthink it sometimes and have to always go back, make sure it's right versus wrong because I don't want to be held accountable. And that's the way, I guess, how I've been living. When I started, and I just got-- I don't know. I started getting depressed."
267.0,272.0,Interviewer,And how did you know that's what it was?
272.0,304.0,Subject,"Because I've never had an anxiety attack. I had an anxiety attack. I started getting depressed. Things started getting stressful. Just that. That's how I knew it was real, because I saw a therapist and he told me what an anxiety attack was. And I figured that was it because I've never had an anxiety attack in my entire life."
304.0,307.0,Interviewer,Where were you when it happened?
307.0,329.0,Subject,"One of them, I was in work. My head started spinning, just flashing darts just coming to my head. Memories, I had to confirm what had happened, didn't happen with people. And I don't know."
329.0,331.0,Interviewer,Do you remember it?
331.0,363.0,Subject,"Yeah. I got out of work, just was going to head home. I think I called a friend, and we talk on the regular, and then I just saw myself almost crying. I was panicking and it lasted for a couple minutes then it went away. It's happened again. And then that was it."
363.0,370.0,Interviewer,And but it sounds like you've spent some time with your friends.
370.0,395.0,Subject,"Yeah, but not [inaudible]. I haven't spent time because of-- now I'm talking clearly, but sometimes I don't talk clear so it's like we don't understand what's going on. I stammer when I'm talking and with the falling. It's random sometimes. I could just be walking and just muscle weakness."
395.0,397.0,Interviewer,Do you think it's related?
397.0,420.0,Subject,"Has to be. One of those questions you ask are do you like walking? I love walking. I love talking. And since then, just been a downfall. This is life.  
"
420.0,423.0,Interviewer,So you like talking?
423.0,449.0,Subject,"Yeah, but sorry. Couple weeks now, I couldn't even talk about it. Now I think it's getting better, I hope. It's been like this for a while now. And I want to leave so I'm trying to get back to work, but all this whatever this is has to stop. One day you're happy. One day you're sad. Mood swings, I don't know."
449.0,452.0,Interviewer,Do you feel like they're swings?
452.0,461.0,Subject,"Well, I don't know because now it's-- I don't know. I really don't know anymore."
461.0,465.0,Interviewer,Are there some days that are happy?
465.0,472.0,Subject,"Last couple of months, [inaudible] not really but I try to think positive."
472.0,479.0,Interviewer,And what is thinking positive?
479.0,533.0,Subject,"Setting goals for yourself, trying to accomplish them. Just looking at the bigger picture. I don't know. I think in different parts of my life, I was just moving way too fast. Went to school for one thing, then I guess my advisor, professor was like, ""You should try to get another Bachelors."" Did that. Started working at Mount Sinai. Like I said, got promoted and then just, I guess, fumbled. I don't think I'm good at relationships because of this fear. I don't know. I don't know where the fear comes from."
533.0,536.0,Interviewer,What is the fear surrounding?
536.0,544.0,Subject,Just making sure everything is right. Making sure everything is in line. I don't know.
544.0,548.0,Interviewer,"So in a relationship, what does in line mean?"
548.0,560.0,Subject,"Making sure the other person's happy, making sure I'm happy. Probably worry a lot so it's just there's no balance. Yeah."
560.0,568.0,Interviewer,No balance. What makes you think there's no balance?
568.0,624.0,Subject,"I told some of my friends-- they always tell me, ""You work too much. You work too much."" But it's like, ""You live in New York City, man."" I don't know. Maybe it's the New Yorker in me. That's how I was brought up. You just got to grind. And everything in New York is expensive versus other places. So it's like if you're not working, what are you doing? You know what I mean? I mean, I do go out with friends. But I think, now, when everything started, I try to avoid them because I don't want them to see me depressed, or you can't talk, or you're walking, you're falling, all that stuff. And I guess, the doctors, all of them are trying to figure out why this happened. They still can't figure it out. Yeah."
624.0,631.0,Interviewer,So how long has it been since you've seen your friends?
631.0,640.0,Subject,[inaudible] a couple months now. [inaudible] try to get out to see family and all that. But it's been a while.
640.0,643.0,Interviewer,Are they worried?
643.0,686.0,Subject,"I'm pretty sure some people are pretty in tune, but the others don't really know what's going on. But yeah, I don't know. Before this, they knew me as someone who was always happy, make sure everybody was comfortable. That's another problem that I think I had, just making sure everyone around me was all right. I think emotionally, it's like you're physically there but you're not really there. You aren't anywhere. You just smile, but you're not living the current moment. In some scenarios--"
686.0,688.0,Interviewer,Can you give me an example?
688.0,713.0,Subject,"Like we were in a restaurant with a bunch of my friends. I have to pick up the tab and make sure [inaudible]. I mean, it's not necessary but I always see the good in people. And I think sometimes, you can't really do that. I learned that now. 50/50, you can't put your all into people. But yeah."
713.0,719.0,Interviewer,So you said you see that now. What brought you there?
719.0,740.0,Subject,"The working environment, I guess. I don't know. And just working, you see people's behavior. And you realize that, oh, this is the real world. You just have to think about yourself, I guess, in some sense. I don't mean selfish but think about yourself."
740.0,747.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you noticed these behaviors at work?
747.0,807.0,Subject,"Work and regular stuff. I think life hit me hard when everything started. I didn't even know the world was moving like that. You can't do everything. I don't know. I mean, I don't know, maybe like a nerve in my brain ticked. That's what people were saying, like, ""You stress yourself out way too much. You've been going all hard on yourself over the last couple years."" But I thought that's what you're supposed to do. I didn't think it was going to lead to this, if we're being honest. If you were to ask me a month earlier in March, you had asked me a couple months ago, ""Where do you see yourself? How's things going?"" I wouldn't say it would be this. I wouldn't even say I'd be here, sitting with you. So you don't know."
807.0,814.0,Interviewer,Yeah. You said you didn't know the world was moving like this. What does that mean?
814.0,838.0,Subject,I didn't know you have to really care for yourself before others. I cared for other people. So it's like I don't know. I always try to make sure everyone around me is all right even when I'm not all right.  You know what I mean?
838.0,844.0,Interviewer,Has there been anybody who's done that for you?
844.0,857.0,Subject,"Yeah, a couple people, couple friends. But I don't know."
857.0,861.0,Interviewer,Do you think maybe they could help with this?
861.0,884.0,Subject,"I guess. I mean, some of them come to the appointments with me. Family members come to the appointments, try to figure out what's going on in my brain. But it's the same thing. They don't see anything. But I don't know. This is probably I think the one day I've been talking properly, but I don't know."
884.0,886.0,Interviewer,I'm not having a problem.
886.0,900.0,Subject,"No, no, no. But if you were to see me a couple days, I can't talk at all, just like the vibration in your voice. You can't really understand. So I like to hope it's getting better with the meds and stuff."
900.0,902.0,Interviewer,"Oh, so you're on medication?"
902.0,905.0,Subject,Yeah.
905.0,908.0,Interviewer,Are you liking it or is it--?
908.0,925.0,Subject,"I hope it works out because I started another one before and mood swings, and depressed, different facial expressions when you're sad, crying."
925.0,927.0,Interviewer,What do you mean different facial expressions?
927.0,964.0,Subject,"You just look sad for no reason. You're crying for a reason and then you're crying for another reason. And then you're depressed. And the next minute, you're not depressed. So it's like what is going on? And I guess the reason why I'm not around people is because I don't want to be around someone and then I'm happy and all of a sudden, I'm randomly depressed or just randomly crying. But I like to think that it's getting better. I hope so."
964.0,970.0,Interviewer,"I mean, if you're speaking like this, seems like something's working."
970.0,975.0,Subject,"I hope. Yeah, knock on wood."
975.0,986.0,Interviewer,So let's say you are getting better. What comes next?
986.0,988.75,Subject,Back to the grind.
988.75,989.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
989.0,992.0,Subject,Yeah.
992.0,995.0,Interviewer,And what's the grind?
995.0,1008.0,Subject,"Going back to work. Yeah, going back to work. Even my coworkers, I think they ask about me. But I try to avoid."
1008.0,1012.0,Interviewer,So what do you do at Sinai?
1012.0,1031.0,Subject,"When I originally came to Sinai 2016, I was working the front desk and then I got promoted to being an admin. assistant. It was pretty cool at first. Then there was like-- I don't know. I guess I got a little bit overwhelmed, but I don't know."
1031.0,1035.0,Interviewer,What did you find overwhelming?
1035.0,1078.0,Subject,"In some sense, the workload. But in another sense, in my mind, I kept thinking I was responsible for these doctors that are really well renowned and important people of the world. So I didn't want to let them down. I just kept getting randomly nervous. I don't know. Before this, I think I get nervous sometimes but not nervous like that. It was just random. I would do something and then have to go back and check and make sure it's right because they're doctors."
1078.0,1081.0,Interviewer,And what kind of things were you checking?
1081.0,1090.0,Subject,"Maybe the assignments going back, forgetting things, and just stuff like that."
1090.0,1094.0,Interviewer,But what did your work consist of?
1094.0,1134.0,Subject,"Department of [dermatology?]. That's about, I don't know now, but [inaudible] at a time, 10 to 15 doctors. You would have to-- I don't know if I'm-- I don't even know if I'm allowed to say this, but it was basically the-- the department itself is pretty behind, like paper. They're not electronic. So some stuff had to be transcribed and I was doing that for a bunch of the doctors. And then they started getting confusing and it was just [inaudible]."
1134.0,1137.0,Interviewer,So you had to transcribe their meetings? Or just--?
1137.0,1143.0,Subject,"No, like their notes, medical notes and stuff for patients and stuff like that."
1143.0,1157.0,Interviewer,Gotcha. And did you like it? Is it something that you--?
1157.0,1182.75,Subject,"Yeah, [inaudible] I liked it. It was kind of boring but I liked it. And then, I guess, when I started people started seeing me having anxiety and getting depressed at the time. Then I got shipped to do something else. And then [inaudible], it all spun out of control and I don't know why."
1182.75,1183.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk]--
1183.0,1215.0,Subject,"And then [inaudible] these last couple months, I sit down and I think all my fears are not really realistic so I don't know what triggers it now, do you know what I mean? Like making sure our relationship is right, making sure the doctors I work for are all right, making sure my family is right. I don't know. I've just always been that person. And I guess I worry a lot if we're being honest. But I don't know."
1215.0,1219.0,Interviewer,What do you mean they're unrealistic now?
1219.0,1232.0,Subject,"Like worrying too much about things that may not even effect you, but just random thinking of you have to make sure this goes well or [kaboom?]."
1232.0,1237.0,Interviewer,And what do you think would happen if you didn't?
1237.0,1247.0,Subject,"Trouble. Fired, I don't know. I mean, [inaudible]. Just--"
1247.0,1251.0,Interviewer,This [inaudible] hadn't been scary?
1251.0,1268.0,Subject,"Sometimes but not really. It's just you get scared if you don't do the task correctly, I guess, because you're responsible."
1268.0,1278.0,Interviewer,"And that notion of responsibility, do you think you've had that your whole life?"
1278.0,1322.0,Subject,"No and yes. No in the sense that, I mean, we didn't have to go that hard but my mindset was just going boom, boom, boom after. I mean, working and just, I guess now, overthinking things, overwhelming yourself for no reason. But it's like if you don't do that, then you're not going to be successful. So now I'm trying to figure out, hopefully when I get better, a balance, moderation. I don't even try [inaudible], it's just, I don't know, always the same."
1322.0,1326.0,Interviewer,And what is success?
1326.0,1377.0,Subject,"Success. Making sure I'm happy, foremost. Making sure, I don't know, saved up a lot, being able to be-- responsibility, responsible. I know my long-term goal, what I actually want to fully be, I'm good around people, I could hold a conversation. But I don't know what the long-term success for it is. I just know I just have to keep grinding or working. Sorry about saying grinding. Working just to that point. And I don't know what that point is. And that's fear within itself because you're like, ""What is it?"""
1377.0,1380.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah, the unknown is very--"
1380.0,1381.0,Subject,It's really scary.
1381.0,1411.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. What do you think-- so excluding work, right, because that is kind of an unknown, what you want to do in life. What do you think would make you happiest now? That was something you said was part of success. So once you're better, what do you think happy is?"
1411.0,1431.0,Subject,"Just meeting the right person. I guess, sometimes when I meet people or being in a relationship, it goes good for a while and I just [inaudible] and just get nervous and I crash."
1431.0,1434.0,Interviewer,And what is crashing look like?
1434.0,1445.0,Subject,I just mean a little anxious or just everything always has to be right.
1445.0,1453.0,Interviewer,But how does that manifest itself? Like are you worried about spending enough time together? What do--?
1453.0,1598.0,Subject,"Yeah, things like that. At the time, I didn't know my limited time. I was just always working, always working. And even my [inaudible]. But I just couldn't pay attention because it was like, ""What are you talking about?"" Like friends tell me, ""You work too much,"" family telling me, ""You work too much."" And I never really understood that, like, ""What do you mean?"" I think one time too, I was at an event and my friend was talking about college because I went to school in Buffalo, then I came back to New York. Buffalo is a cool city. It's pretty boring, but if you ever go there just bring a jacket. She was saying that. She was telling me that. She was like, through our academic career, she didn't know how I made it because I was working and doing school. And you know how some people will just have fun in college? I mean, I did have fun but I was always just too responsible. So when you get in the role, you try to be in a relationship and, I don't know, you just don't know how things work and you don't know how to deal with stress. So poof. Some might call it a-- just worry a lot. I don't know how not to worry because of the unknown of anything. And I think that's what triggered all these things. But now, even when I try to slow down it's still the same. Got sick, got depressed. And sometimes you're just sick and I ask myself, ""Why now? Why me?"" I didn't even know depression was a real thing, to be honest. I felt depressed. And even family or just-- you're just depressed. It was just like, ""Oh, you're depressed for a day. You're sad because maybe something happened to someone or something happened to you."" Sorry."
1598.0,1600.0,Interviewer,"Oh, [inaudible]."
1600.0,1647.0,Subject,"And you just get depressed. And I don't know, maybe too, when I took some courses in school, I kind of read about depression. I kind of learned about depression and kind of learned about anxiety. But I thought anxiety-- at the time, I'm thinking anxiety is, ""Oh, you're just stressed out. You'll get over it today."" Like the full time of depression, I didn't think it was a whole mental health problem. I didn't think that that was real. I hate when you tell your family members or friends, say, ""Depressed? What are you depressed about? You're working. You're doing everything you're supposed to do."""
1647.0,1652.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's the weird thing about depression. It doesn't really make sense, right?"
1652.0,1656.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. It really doesn't."
1656.0,1661.0,Interviewer,"Being sad about something in particular makes sense, but being sad without that--"
1661.0,1693.0,Subject,"Yes, it really doesn't make sense. I think people [inaudible]. Like no, this is a real thing. But I don't even know how to tolerate this. I mean, I did the right thing. I went to a therapist. I saw a psychiatrist. She threw me on drugs. And some days, I like to hope things are getting better. Other days, I'm like, ""Oh, man. Here we go again."""
1693.0,1696.0,Interviewer,So does it still go in waves a little bit?
1696.0,1748.0,Subject,"Yeah. But you just got to get rid of this somehow. So you talked about [inaudible] relationships and job. I started getting depressed. I started feeling pain in my body, like just random pain. Just imagine waking up and then just random pain in your body for no reason or maybe a reason. You try to figure it out. And all the doctors are like, ""No, everything organ-wise or body-wise is fine. It's all a mental thing."" So I really don't know. But I guess for my family, I try to think positive because they really care about me."
1748.0,1752.0,Interviewer,Sounds like [inaudible] again.
1752.0,1756.0,Subject,It's not traumatic.
1756.0,1782.0,Interviewer,"Well, I think being positive can be really hard in these situations and it seems like you're trying really, really hard and I think that's, I think, only going to help. But still finding the right person, is that something that you want out of the end of this?"
1782.0,1786.0,Subject,I guess so.
1786.0,1806.0,Interviewer,"How do you think-- well, one, how do you think that will help you be happy? And two, what does that look like? What is that perfect-- not perfect, but what is that happiness?"
1806.0,1823.0,Subject,"I guess, the other person just has to be somewhat successful. I don't know. And just, I don't know. That's a hard question."
1823.0,1828.0,Interviewer,Is it about being successful or something else?
1828.0,1835.0,Subject,"Being successful or being-- what do you mean by something else? 
"
1835.0,1853.0,Interviewer,"So I asked that question. You said being successful was-- this was an important part of that, being successful. And I'm saying is there anything that you think it could do over and above making you feel successful?"
1853.0,1855.0,Subject,[inaudible].
1855.0,1862.0,Interviewer,Why does that contribute to success?
1862.0,1887.0,Subject,"Because it makes you happy. I don't know. I really don't. I don't know. We're taught that. I don't know. It's the way we're built. It's like everyone wants to find someone. Everyone wants to be successful. If you're not successful, how do I even try, you know? How do I--?"
1887.0,1888.0,Interviewer,How do you what?
1888.0,1900.0,Subject,How do you buy things if you're not successful? How do you go places if you're not successful? Like travel if you don't have that mindset? I don't know.
1900.0,1902.0,Interviewer,Is travelling something you want to do?
1902.0,1916.0,Subject,I [inaudible] travelling at the time. I should probably travel more. I liked it when I was little. Got to see places. Got to see different cultures. Pretty cool.
1916.0,1919.0,Interviewer,Where did you go?
1919.0,1958.0,Subject,"I went to London. I went to back home, up in [inaudible]. I've been there. It's really cool over there. Just a little different, like the way they think and then dress is-- they have to come over here and see the real world because their mindset is different. But Nigeria, I went through Ghana. I think that's the only places that-- I said London already, right? Yeah. Those are the only foreign countries I've been to. And then everything else is state by state. Oh, and I've been to Jamaica. It was a good experience."
1958.0,1962.0,Interviewer,"I mean, sometimes the states are totally different cultures."
1962.0,1964.0,Subject,"Yeah, like Buffalo."
1964.0,1967.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Really?
1967.0,2003.75,Subject,"Yeah, so I always looked at New York as being aggressive. It's like you get on a train. People are mushing you. They [inaudible]. Buffalo, it's like you wake up in the morning and it's like they're smiling at you. People are happy. ""How's it going?"" Like the greetings, you know what I mean. And even, it's like that in Florida. I think when I went to Florida at one point-- this is therapeutic by the way, but-- the talking."
2003.75,2004.0,Interviewer,It is?
2004.0,2042.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I went to Florida and it's just like everything down there is just slow. New York is fast paced. Everything is boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Like for example, if you were to look at what you did today or how you'd live, it's probably fast paced versus being in Florida. It's like 11:00 and you still have things to do. Here, it's like you got to keep on pushing. If you ever just, I don't know, take a day, go to 42nd and look at the tourists and you're like, ""Why are you standing there? Keep it pushing."""
2042.0,2044.0,Interviewer,I know. I think every New Yorker hates Times Square.
2044.0,2063.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah. It's just the train. It was after Buffalo; I didn't even know the train had a schedule. So it's stuff like that. It closes at a certain time. Buses end at a certain time. So it's stuff like that. Yeah.
2063.0,2067.0,Interviewer,Do you think those people are more successful or less successful?
2067.0,2114.0,Subject,"Depends. I can't make that call. I can't make that call. From a [inaudible], I don't think Buffalo's a rich city because people are-- but some people out there are wealthy. But it's like, I wouldn't be surprised it's cheaper over there. So it may be easier to get richer. I guess, you live in New York, you live within bricks. Over there, you actually have a house, a backyard. I mean, there's certain parts of New York that has that but the expense would be crazy. Yeah. If you can't get-- like right here and even [inaudible], you can't get a real house. It's buildings, you know what I mean?"
2114.0,2115.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It's like apartments. Yeah.
2115.0,2120.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're paying for an apartment."
2120.0,2128.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I feel like, also, people own less property. They rent more here."
2128.0,2160.0,Subject,"Yeah. People a lot, people rent more. And even the money that you use to rent, there is, I think, you can establish yourself in Buffalo. I don't know, buy a house. Think about it. An average room in Manhattan is like a million, maybe. Go to Buffalo. You can buy a couple houses. You'd look like the queen of or king of Buffalo, I don't know, in Florida and all those spaces."
2160.0,2162.0,Interviewer,"So do you like it there, [inaudible]?"
2162.0,2164.0,Subject,"What, Buffalo?"
2164.0,2166.0,Interviewer,Florida and Buffalo.
2166.0,2217.0,Subject,"No. The elements are rough. After a while, it will just get boring, the same routine. It's nice to smile at people, but come on. We're New Yorkers here. What are you doing? It's slow paced. And then, I think, in the summertime there's not really a lot of stuff for you to do. New York is just the-- that's one thing I loved about New York. It's always going. There's always something to do. You go to other states, things shut down, literally, shut down. So if you're a foreigner, you're looking-- if you go to a club or a party, you can still get there late in New York and still have fun versus other states where it's like, ""No, this is a rule. You have to leave at this time. Go home."""
2217.0,2223.0,Interviewer,Have they had other laws about that? Like drinking or--?
2223.0,2230.0,Subject,"I'm not sure, but drinking everywhere has rules, restrictions."
2230.0,2236.0,Interviewer,I feel like I've heard about some states where you can't buy alcohol on certain days or something. It's a very--
2236.0,2237.0,Subject,"Yeah, and--"
2237.0,2240.0,Interviewer,It's like--
2240.0,2269.0,Subject,"And now I think about it, I went to California before and I think they sell-- I might be wrong [inaudible] but they sell alcohol in regular stores, like gas stations and stuff versus here-- like the vodka and stuff, versus here where it's you have to have a liquor store. You can buy alcohol anywhere."
2269.0,2272.0,Interviewer,California is like even more [inaudible].
2272.0,2300.0,Subject,"But it's nice over there. It's just I think a lot of people go over there thinking they're going to make it and it doesn't happen. So you see a lot of poverty and homeless people and stuff like that. Crazy. Just yeah, it's like the - what's that word - apocalypse. In a sense, yeah, it's true. Like some streets, it's like just [inaudible]. Some areas, yeah."
2300.0,2303.0,Interviewer,Worse than here?
2303.0,2308.0,Subject,"That's a big debate because a lot of people go to Hollywood to make it, you know what I mean?"
2308.0,2309.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
2309.0,2326.0,Subject,"Because a lot of people go to-- like you think about your favorite actor, think about your favorite actress. They'll tell you at one point their life story, how they were like living in a car. Everyone is always living in a car. But yeah."
