0,9,Interviewer,"No. So the first thing that I'll start with you is, how have things been going for you lately?"
9,77,Subject,"Exhausting. I've been very stressed out at work. I actually had to-- I don't know. Yesterday was a weird day for me. Well, not a weird day, it was a good day. I had a panic attack in the middle of my sleep, which is weird, so I woke up in the middle of that. And then I literally went to bed at 1:00, woke up at 3:00 AM, went back to bed at 6:30 AM, and then woke up back at 8:30 AM because I had a job interview that day, which actually turned out surprisingly well. I don't think I got the job because nobody wants the scheduling, but she really liked me, and it kind of made my day a little bit better after she said I looked cute and I was funny, and that kind of boosts the self-confidence a bit. God knows I need that. But yesterday  was a pretty good day because I had a bunch of food and everything. But besides that, the whole week has been stressful, like school and everything, trying to look for jobs, having paranoia and everything, worried about school, money. I don't know. I've just been very anxious, and I'm just so tired. I mean, my body's not tired, but my mind is, and I'm done with school."
77,79,Interviewer,So you're a senior?
79,84,Subject,I'm a junior in college. I transferred from John Jay to Hunter this semester. This is my first semester.
84,89,Interviewer,Great. So you're looking for then just a summer job?
89,117,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I'm looking for part-time too. I kind of want part-time, but I'm not getting the most opportunities because the way my scheduling is. Because when I transferred to Hunter-- because I'm usually the last one to get enrolled in classes, so the scheduling is very mixed up at the moment. So not a lot of people want that scheduling, so I kind of have to wait until I can schedule for next semester to start looking for a part-time job or for work study."
117,118,Interviewer,Work study?
118,142,Subject,"It's where you work for your school. It comes with your financial aid, and they assign you different jobs in the school, that you work for your school, and then they pay you. It doesn't go to your tuition. It goes to you. They're depositing it and everything. I know I shouldn't have a lot of worry trouble because I got paid to go to school anyway. I got like $3,000 this semester."
142,143,Interviewer,"Oh, that's good."
143,145,Subject,Yeah. That's a refund from financial aid.
145,153,Interviewer,Very cool. And so what kind of jobs are you interested in?
153,186,Subject,"Right now, I'm just looking for anything that's entry level because I don't have a lot of experience because my parents never let me work until I was 18, till I started college. And then I had one job at McDonald's for that, and then I got a job at a retail store. But I'm just looking for anything retail. I'm also trying to look into shifts for culinary because I want to be a culinary chef at one point in my life, but I kind of need the food handling license for that. And you need money to pay for that, and I can't do that now. So I'm just trying to look for any entry level job with retail if that's available."
186,191,Interviewer,Nice. And that's really cool about wanting to go to culinary school.
191,197,Subject,I want to be a pastry chef. I like baking a lot since I was like eight or something.
197,202,Interviewer,Wow. So did you bake at home a lot?
202,257,Subject,"Yeah. I used to bake at home a lot, but then my mom got diagnosed with diabetes. So I can't really bake a lot because she can't have a lot of sugar. I mean, when I do bake, I try to alter the recipes a bit, so that way, she can eat it without having a sugar overdose, which is very interesting, especially [inaudible] le dulce leches. It's her favorite cake. It's a cake with like three milks. It's super sweet, and it's very sugary, like it says, so I have to make it taste the same without the sugar, without half the sugar. So it's really hard. I have to add more vanilla, more flavor, more this, more that, more other stuff, and then it's sweet. It's kind of fun experimenting because she can still eat the food, and I can still bake. I'm actually trying to find a way how to make this cookie she likes a lot. It's a peanut butter cookie, but the ones she get would be always so sugary, and she can't have a lot."
257,264,Interviewer,That's really sweet. When did you start experimenting like this?
264,272,Subject,"Well, when I was like 13 because I had a lot of time left over, so I was just like, ""I'm just going to bake a lot,"" and I just started baking."
272,278,Interviewer,And you stuck with it. What do you enjoy about baking?
278,294,Subject,"I don't know. It just kind of takes me into my own little world trying to bake and everything. I have to focus on the baking, and I don't have to focus about anything else outside of life, not to mention you get to eat. You get to eat the results right after, so it's always fun. And I-- sorry."
294,295,Interviewer,"No, go ahead."
295,303,Subject,"And I always have a sweet tooth, so I always like something sweet like cookies, cake, cupcakes, all that jazz."
303,304,Interviewer,I also love sweets.
304,306,Subject,Yeah. They're really good.
306,316,Interviewer,"So being a pastry chef, that sounds exciting. Have you looked into any programs?"
316,352,Subject,"I looked into the ICE Institute of Culinary Arts here in Manhattan, and I kind of want to go there after college. I was trying to drop out of college after my first semester and then just go straight to culinary school, but I couldn't. So right now, I'm just trying to get a degree and then just go to culinary school right after. But I'm trying to look for culinary internships on the side, so I'm just looking for anything or anything that's relatable to culinary. So that way, it'll be fun, build up a little bit more experience because I don't have a lot of experience in culinary because of the fact of my parents kind of pushed me to science."
352,357,Interviewer,They pushed you?
357,407,Subject,"I mean, they just said, ""Don't get a job where you're not going to get a lot of money."" They said, ""Be a scientist, be a doctor, be a lawyer, be an accountant. Just don't do anything in the creative arts."" And I'm just like, ""Okay."" I mean, they know a chef can get a lot of money, but it's like split chances. I don't know the-- I don't know the statistics. And they wanted me to do well in science, well in math, and I was like, ""Okay. I'll do science."" And they were really worried about it bad, but they didn't like the fact that I wanted to go to culinary school. When I wound up like I kind of wanted to start cooking for a profession, they said, ""That's [inaudible],"" and so I'm just like, ""Okay. I'll do science."" And I said, ""I can do science,"" but it didn't work out in college, so that's why I was like, ""I just want to do culinary, and I just want to cook."""
407,408,Interviewer,It didn't work out?
408,465,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, college isn't for me, in general. I just don't like learning-- I mean, it's not like I don't like learning. It's just like I just can't-- I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. College isn't for me. School is not for me. School has never been for me. I haven't been the straight-A student, so college isn't for me. I knew that I was going into college, and then after the first semester, I kind of just failed everything. It kind of like confirmed my suspicions. I'm not saying like, ""Oh, I came in with the mindset of thinking like, 'Oh, I'm going to fail anyway. I'm not even going to try.'"" I did try. I tried my hardest to do everything the right-- well, I still end up failing, and I'm just like, ""You know what? It's not for me."" It really causes a lot of stress, causes all of this, causes this and this and that, and I was just like, ""Yeah. I don't want to do this anymore."""
465,467,Interviewer,So it was stressful?
467,470,Subject,Yes.
470,473,Interviewer,What do you think was the most stressful for you?
473,498,Subject,"Exams, trying to do homework. Because I was living with my sister at the time in my first semester, and she didn't have a babysitter, so I would have to babysit my niece and nephew while I'm doing my homework, which was very rare because she always told me I had to help my nephew on his homework, which he would take like five hours to do. And I never really had time to-- once I'm done with his homework, I tried to my homework, but then she tells me I have to help her cook."
498,503,Interviewer,And then you moved out?
503,507,Subject,"I got kicked out of my sister's like two years ago, and I moved back in with my parents."
507,508,Interviewer,Goodness. Kicked out?
508,514,Subject,"Yeah. We had an argument, and she said, ""Get out,"" and I was like, ""Okay."""
514,516,Interviewer,That sounds really upsetting.
516,525,Subject,"It was, but I kind of moved past it because she was going through her own stuff at the time. She had just found out her now ex-husband, I think, cheated on her, so I was like, ""That's okay."""
525,532,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so sad. But why was she angry with you?"
532,589,Subject,"I mean, I was planning to leave anyway because of the fact I kind of felt like she had all this stress about how she's going to support two kids, how she's going to deal with the husband thing, yada, yada, yada. And I kind of just thought-- I wanted to help, but I think it was best if I helped outside of the house, if that's understandable. If I moved out, got my own job, able to pay bills and everything, and work, I would be able to help her more freely. Because she started getting very angry. She started getting irritated. She started not being the person that she said she was going to be when I moved in, and yeah. But she just wasn't down with it. She literally said like, ""If you ever move out of here but you're not married, you're not taking any of the stuff that you have here. You're only going home with two pairs of shorts and two pairs of pants,"" and I was like, ""Okay."""
589,590,Interviewer,Oh my gosh.
590,615,Subject,"Yeah. I was kicked out, and then I went to the store and [inaudible]. And I still love her. I'm not mad at her and everything. I'm not mad at her or anything. I try to look at it like she was going through this stuff. It doesn't matter. I just hope she gets better in the future. And she might have cut me off from the family - my brother did too - but I just hope, in the future, we could talk at one point in my life."
615,618,Interviewer,Yeah. Your brother was also upset?
618,684,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, me and him never got along. I don't know why. He just always hated me for a while. I think it was because I'm spoiled. I'm not sure. And he was always on my sister's side, so there was that. I mean, because they got along together and everything. I didn't know my sister for a while, for like 12 years when I moved in with her. Because she ran away when I was 3, and then she just came back into my life at 16 and said, ""You're living with me from now on,"" and I was like, ""Okay. I guess."" I didn't want to at first. I told her straight up, ""I don't want to live with you. I want to live in a group home. I'd rather do something else."" I didn't want to live with my parents, but I didn't want to live with her because I didn't think it was the right choice. But she kept on saying, ""No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're coming. You're good."" I was like, ""Okay. If you say so."" And then she said-- and then like I said, everything went downhill, and yeah. My brother doesn't like me, in general. And just the fact I was disrespecting my sister like that, he just wasn't with it. I was like, ""Okay."""
684,690,Interviewer,Wow. But so they were still in each other's lives even though she was not in yours?
690,691,Subject,Yeah.
691,692,Interviewer,Are they both older?
692,707,Subject,"Yeah. They're both five years apart. No, not five years, something around there. 33 minus 26, how old is that?"
707,708,Interviewer,Six.
708,709,Subject,Six years.
709,711,Interviewer,Seven. I can't do math [laughter].
711,719,Subject,Me neither. That's why I gave up on school. They're closer apart than me and my sister was. My sister is 12 years older than me.
719,720,Interviewer,I see.
720,732,Subject,"Yeah. And my brother's five years older than me, so they're both in the same generation. I was born in Gen Z. They were born in millennials, and I was like, ""Nah."" And like I said, she ran away when I was three."
732,733,Interviewer,She ran away?
733,801,Subject,"Yeah. She ran away. She was 16. My brother was, 3 plus 5, 8. I was 3, so I don't remember her. And she just never came into my life until I was-- she came in [inaudible], and she got pregnant with my niece. So she came to visit us so I could get to know her and everything. But after a year of her bringing my niece, she stopped coming when I was around 12. So she then didn't get into my life until I was 16, so that was four years later. So three plus-- I don't know. It's a long time. I just never got to know her as a sister. I'm just like, ""I appreciate you doing your sister job and everything, but--"" and not to mention when I moved in with her, she started acting like a mother, and I'm just like, ""I don't even know you as a sister, so what makes you think you can act like a mother?"" And I'm just like, ""Okay."" I tried to go with it, and then I just couldn't deal with it, and I'm just like, ""Okay."" Because like, ""I'm already 16. I don't need a mom."""
801,807,Interviewer,And what made you want to move out of your parent's place?
807,851,Subject,"Oh, my parents were abusive, and my sister knew that, so she said like, ""Let's try to report them and get you out of the house."" Because one night, I told her I was being suicidal and everything, and she said, ""Okay. We got to stop this."" And so we reported my parents to CPS and then yada, yada, yada. Yeah. And then my sister said, ""She's living with me,"" and I said, ""No. I don't want to live with you."" I mean, I tried convincing her like, ""No. I don't think it's a good idea,"" which it never was to live with her, but she said, ""It's fine. You're going to be fine. Everything's going to be fine."" I'm just like, ""Okay, fine. Whatever."""
851,865,Interviewer,"When you were feeling that way, it seems like a really big deal, and now you are making special desserts for your mom."
865,924,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I moved past it. I mean, in terms of abuse from my parents, it was expected because that's just how Hispanic people just disciplined their kids. So once I kind of figured that out, I was like, ""Okay, yeah,"" like, ""Yeah. They're going to discipline me like that until I reach a certain age, and then they're just not going to discipline me."" And then, yeah, I'm just like, ""Okay. That's on them."" So I kind of grew past it, but I guess my brother and sister can't really get past it. I don't know. Because I know them abusing kids is not the best way to discipline a kid. I know there's better ways. But in the end, they're still trying to be a parent. And then will they say they regret abusing their kids? No, of course not. They think they did nothing wrong."
924,929,Interviewer,What part of it did you find the most upsetting?
929,931,Subject,About what?
931,936,Interviewer,About how they treated you and your siblings.
936,983,Subject,"I mean, what I find most upsetting is that they're not willing to take into consideration that like, ""Yeah. Maybe you throwing your kid against the wall is not really the best idea."" It's not really a good idea, in general, and they don't feel guilty about it, in general. They think they're in the right. They think they had every right to do it because they're the parents and yada, yada, yada, so I'm not sure. And that's kind of what upsets me the most because they're just not willing to accept the fact that they are wrong. But, again, that's every parent, so yeah. I mean, it's whatever now. I mean, they still try to be parents and everything. I think my mom kind of knows that she kind of screwed up, especially when I moved out of the house for two years."
983,985,Interviewer,What did she say when you moved back in?
985,1014,Subject,"She was happy. She was like, ""Oh my God. God gave me my daughter back,"" and she was crying. And I was kind of wary of her and everything because I didn't know what was going to happen and yada, yada, yada. Yeah. She was just very happy that I got back home. Apparently, she went through a whole depression episode for a while after I moved out."
1014,1020,Interviewer,And how are you liking it now?
1020,1060,Subject,"I mean, they're better than how they were back then. I mean, me and my dad have our differences, but he wasn't in my life most of my-- he wasn't in most of my life most of the days, so I just-- I mean, so I don't really see him as a father either. I'm just like, ""I just see you as a person who just pays the bills and everything. I know you're my dad, and I love you like my-- and I love you and everything,"" but I'm just like, ""Eh, you don't have any authority over me like you want to,"" and I'm just like, ""And that's not my fault. That's not my fault."" Everything now is okay. It's nice. We're trying to get past it."
1060,1063,Interviewer,It sounds like it's moving in a positive direction.
1063,1086,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, as far as my brother and sister, I don't know, but I hope it does in the future. But, yeah, [inaudible] talking."
1086,1100,Interviewer,"And what about the rest of your time? You're heading towards the summer, and you're looking for jobs, so what do you like to do in your spare time when you're not in school?"
1100,1128,Subject,"I tend to read, write, listen to music, watch TV. And I also play this one video game I have because I recently just bought a Nintendo Switch, and it came with the game Smash Ultimate, which is pretty fun just beating people up. I know that's weird. But kind of just try to do creative stuff like write, read, watch TV, try to sleep if I ever can sleep. I don't usually sleep a lot."
1128,1130,Interviewer,Why don't you sleep?
1130,1139,Subject,"I mean, I think I'm a bit of an insomniac. When I was 13, I just stopped sleeping. I mean, the most hours I get is like four hours a week."
1139,1141,Interviewer,What? A week?
1141,1196,Subject,"Yeah. It's no big deal. It's been like that since I was 15. I'm used to it at this point. It's been like seven years. It doesn't matter. I just stopped sleeping because I always get these weird terrors. Like literally last weekend-- not last weekend. Yesterday, I had one. I think I mentioned it in the beginning. I don't remember. I had a weird panic attack in the middle of my sleep, so that's why I just stopped sleeping in general. It used to happen a lot, like three times a week when I was younger. That's why I stopped sleeping. So I just stopped sleeping, and it just stopped happening. And that's why I just don't do it because I don't want that because it's just like-- what was I going to say? It's like a hassle, so I am just like, ""I just don't want-- I'll just stop sleeping."
1196,1201,Interviewer,"How do you spend most of the night? Are you in bed trying to sleep, or do you just kind of--?"
1201,1215,Subject,"I'm in bed trying to sleep. But if I accept the fact that I can't sleep, I just go on my computer. I play my game, listen to music, watch videos on YouTube, just to try to pass the time."
1215,1221,Interviewer,"And when you have the panic attacks, do you remember what made them happen?"
1221,1252,Subject,"Well, when they happen in my sleep, no, because I don't [inaudible] see it. I don't remember the dreams I was having to have me have a panic attack. I mean, but, usually, most of the panic attacks for me come out of the blue. I start getting scared. I just start getting-- I can't breathe. I start feeling like something's going to come at me or something. I mean, when they do happen for a reason, the main reason is because I have to do a public speaking thing, and I don't like public speaking. I just get very nervous when the center of attention's on me."
1252,1256,Interviewer,"Oh, my goodness. How much do you have to do public speaking?"
1256,1292,Subject,"Not a lot now since I changed my major, which thank God. But there's still times where the center of attention has to be on me because of the fact I'm in a creative writing class, so they're going to be critiquing my story. And they have to do attention on me, and I'm just like, ""Oh God."" I don't like that. I mean, it gets scary, and then-- I forgot what I was going to say. I'm tired. I literally had two hours of sleep last night, but that's okay. I'll just sleep on the train if I can. What was I going to say? What was I talking about?"
1292,1293,Interviewer,Public speaking.
1293,1297,Subject,"Oh, yeah. "
1297,1299,Interviewer,What was your major before where you were doing a lot--?
1299,1301,Subject,I was a forensic science major.
1301,1302,Interviewer,"Oh, cool."
1302,1308,Subject,"Yeah, at John Jay. But then I transferred to Hunter and became an English creative writing major."
1308,1309,Interviewer,What made you switch to that?
1309,1329,Subject,"Because creative writing's been something I've been wanting to do since I was like 10. I just love writing. I love reading the creative writing books and everything. But like I said, that's creative. It doesn't make a lot of money, so my parents were like, ""No. You can't do that."" And I was like, ""Okay. I guess I'll go into science."" And that didn't work out for me, and I was like, ""You know? Fuck it. I'm going to go back to writing."""
1329,1334,Interviewer,And so what were you writing at 10?
1334,1391,Subject,"Poems, mainly, like really short stories. I would make good stories. I would always make up stories about life and everything. I always had my own little world, and that's where I made up the stories and everything, like, ""Oh, this person does this and this and that, and this person does this and this and that. I hang out with this person,"" or something and then be like a superpower and everything. But then I started doing horror writing. I write about gore. I mean, I write about murder and everything. I'm not saying I'm a murderer or anything. I'm not sure at this point. I just like writing about horror and gory stuff now because it's so interesting, especially since the fact I took a lot of medical classes. So I know the anatomy of the body well, so I could just always pinpoint like, ""Oh, yeah. You're going to slice this person up in this way to cause the most amount of bleeding or the least amount of bleeding, and it's going to be fun."""
1391,1393,Interviewer,So that forensic science did come in handy.
1393,1401,Subject,"Yeah, it does, especially when I have to learn about blood spatter and where the blood's going to hit the wall and yada, yada, yada."
1401,1404,Interviewer,"To sound very accurate, scientifically."
1404,1415,Subject,"Yes. Yeah. I mean, I was very good in the science classes, just not in college. Because I took the medical classes and a forensic class back in high school."
1415,1416,Interviewer,"Oh, really? They have that in high school?"
1416,1424,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. My high school, High School for Health Professions and Human Services. I did the volunteer work to become a CMA, and I took--"
1424,1425,Interviewer,CMA?
1425,1444,Subject,"Clinical medical assistant, a medical assistant. I became an administrative medical assistant. I didn't have enough hours to go into clinical. But, yeah, I took the test. I became a medical assistant. And I took a forensic science class because my-- I am thirsty."
1444,1446,Interviewer,"Oh, we can get you some water."
1446,1452,Subject,Let me see. Do I have any water over here? Is that still recording?
1452,1464,Interviewer,Yeah. It's okay. I can pause it. We can go fill up your water bottle. [inaudible].
1464,1465,Subject,What were we talking about again?
1465,1467.75,Interviewer,What were we talking about?
1467.75,1468,Subject,Rewind.
1468,1471,Interviewer,"Oh, your stories, your writing."
1471,1522,Subject,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I like writing about gore and everything. Right now, the current story I'm writing for my class, it's going to be a second point of view, and it's basically talking about-- it's kind of how I am kind of. Don't you ever get two voices in your head, and one's telling you to do something-- both of them are telling you to do something that you wouldn't do normally because you're a shy little person. But then one voice is telling you to do something really, really, really bad like murder your mom or something. But I'm not saying I'm going to murder my mom, by the way. Or maybe like, ""Go help a person cross the street or something because you're so shy."" I kind of write about that. It's going to be a second point of view, which I don't know if that's going to really count for this class because this class is a fiction writing class. I don't know if it counts as fiction. I think it counts as fiction, maybe. I'm not sure."
1522,1525,Interviewer,Why wouldn't it?
1525,1542,Subject,"I don't know. That's the thing. I don't think it would. I'm going to ask one of my friends in my class to what's his opinion about it. Maybe I could change my whole story right now or just not. I actually have to critique his story, actually, today, which is going to be fun."
1542,1544,Interviewer,It's nice that you have friends in the class.
1544,1550,Subject,"I mean, it's awkward between me and him."
1550,1551,Interviewer,Really?
1551,1706,Subject,"Yeah. He's my ex-boyfriend, so [laughter]. Yep, there's that. And I'm just like, ""All right. Going to try to live my life. I guess we got to do this."" It's so funny because we'll be-- when we were dating, we said if we ever broke up, we would still help each other out and be friends. But now we broke up, and we just never talked to each other for two years, and I'm just like, ""Okay, cool."" And I see him randomly here, and I was like, ""Hey."" He's like, ""Hi."" I was just like, ""What's up?"" and I'm just like, ""Oh God."" It's awkward. It really is awkward, especially now. I'm being integrated back into our friend group because we had a lot of friends on that scholar program that I was in, SEO Scholars. I don't know if you heard about that. Have you heard about it? It's a scholar program for people coming from low-income neighborhoods and income families who have high grades, and then they help them get into college and yada, yada, yada. I need to get back to this story. So, yeah, I'm being integrated back into our friend group because his best friend, which used to be a really good friend of mine when we were dating-- his best friend reached out to me and said, ""You got to start hanging out with us again."" And I told him straight up like, ""No. The breakup was really bad. It's going to be awkward."" He's like, ""You know it's going to be awkward."" At this point, he's just waiting for one of us to say something to the other because it's kind of funny. It's like a freaking novella, honestly. So he's just waiting for one of us to say something about that breakup so we could just get over it, and I told him like, ""I'm not going to say anything."" And he told me like, ""Yeah. He's not going to say anything either."" And I'm just like-- and he's like, ""It's so funny."" Because he literally told us we're both just waiting for someone to say something, and at this point, he's just super annoyed about how [inaudible] just saying. I'm just like, ""I gave my reason for why I'm not saying anything,"" and I'm just like, ""I don't know his reasons."" And we're like, ""I don't know."" And one of my friends actually-- my best friend actually gave me the idea. Since we're both in the same class-- we're both reading each other's story. I have to read his story, so I don't know if he did it or he had the same idea. But one of my friends gave me the idea. Since I'm doing a hypothetical-- I'm doing a hypothetical approach on my story, I should write, ""Maybe that voice is going to tell you to confront your ex,"" and then yada, yada, yada and write it into the story. That way, I'm not bringing it up, formally, but I'm giving him the idea like, ""Dude, we need to talk, but I don't know how to start it. You got to start it."""
1706,1707,Interviewer,Yeah. That can be the way.
1707,1811,Subject,"It's going to be-- it's going to be a shitshow. I know for sure. I mean, that's if he even takes the hint. He's very oblivious. I remember I tried to drop so many hints to him to take me to his prom, but he didn't. And he went to prom without me, and I was just like, ""Oh, thanks for that."" He didn't even tell me. I was dropping so many hints. Because my prom was expensive as fuck, and then so I couldn't go to my prom because it was either my prom or my senior trip, and I chose my senior trip. For his prom, it was cheap, and I could've done it. And so I was like, ""You ought to go to--"" I literally straight up like, ""Do you ever think about going to prom this year?"" He was like, ""No. I don't think I'm going to prom."" He was like, ""Maybe, I'm not sure."" I'm like, ""My prom was too expensive, so I don't know. I wouldn't mind going to your prom."" He was like, ""Oh, okay. Cool."" And then we're hanging out with all his friends and everything, and it was actually that friend that ratted him out, accidentally. He was like, ""Oh, you ready for prom, for pregaming for prom?"" And he was like, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah."" I'm like, ""Pregaming? What are you guys going to do tomorrow?"" He was like, ""Oh, yeah. We're going to prom tomorrow."" I was like, ""And you never told me? You never invited me?"" He was like, ""You said you didn't want to go."" I said, ""No. I said I didn't want to go to my prom because it was expensive. I said I wouldn't mind going to yours if you asked me."" He was like, ""Uh."" I got back at him, though, because-- you know how at graduation, they give you those corsages, those fake corsages? I have all of his friends on my social media, Instagram and Facebook, so I literally posted on all this in the stories. I posted like, ""Guys, look, it's the corsage my boyfriend never got me for prom."" I called him out on it because everybody already knew that he never took me to prom, and they knew why. And I was just like, ""You know what? I'm going to call you out."""
1811,1812,Interviewer,What did he say?
1812,1826,Subject,"He's like, ""That hurt."" I'm like, ""Good. Let it hurt. I wanted to go to prom, and I never had the prom moment."" I didn't have a [inaudible] either, so I was just like, ""Okay. That could've been my chance. Okay, cool."""
1826,1829,Interviewer,What was appealing about prom?
1829,1853,Subject,"I don't know. You get to hang out with friends. Your parents aren’t there. I guess you're just having fun. You're just flying loose. You get to drink. You get to do stuff. I'm not saying like sex stuff. I didn't want sex at the time [laughter]. It just seemed fun. Just a night to spend with friends and you didn't have to worry about anything. But, yeah, so now I'm in that class with him."
1853,1855,Interviewer,That's quite a coincidence.
1855,1891,Subject,"It really is. I mean, I knew there was going to be a chance when I transferred to Hunter because I knew-- we broke up in our freshman year of college. I broke up with him, but he said something that just freaking destroyed me. And when I decided I wanted to transfer to do creative writing and Hunter was my best shot, I was like, ""I know there's going to be a chance that I'm going to see him, but I'm pretty sure--"" I thought the chances were going to be like I'm going to see him in the future, not--"
1891,1892,Interviewer,Your first class.
1892,1936,Subject,"Not like my first class in my first semester there. Or I thought it would've been like we would've been comfortable with each other at that point if we ever took a class together. I didn't think we were going to be at this point now where I see him twice a week, and I'm just like, ""What the fuck?"" But I thought we would've gotten over the awkward part by now so that we could go, ""Help me,"" or something. Because I knew we would've been taken at least some classes already, but yeah. And I'm just like, ""He's in my class,"" and I'm just like, ""It's--"" I try to say it's whatever. I don't know. He still seems petty about the breakup and everything. I don't know. And my friend's saying like, ""He's just mad because you're getting so far in life."" And I'm like, ""Yeah. Because I'm in a relation now."""
1936,1937,Interviewer,"Oh, you've got a new relationship."
1937,1940,Subject,Yep. My boyfriend right now.
1940,1943,Interviewer,"Great. Well, how long have you guys [inaudible]?"
1943,2018,Subject,"Okay. This one was weird. No. Because we started dating in November, and we ended-- we didn't end, but we took a break. Because I was going through some really bad mental health issues in school and everything, and we started dating right before finals started. So I kind of just told him straight up like, ""I don't think I'm ready for a relation right now because I'm going through some shit and a bunch at school,"" and he completely understand. And I was like, ""I'm really not sure what I'm feeling right now,"" and he completely understood. And he said, ""Okay. Maybe after school or something, we could try again,"" and I was like, ""Okay, yeah. Cool."" And we kept on talking throughout that little break, and we started going out again-- the last week of December, we went out again, and we started going out more frequently. Because he wanted to make it official on the third date, and I was like, ""That's too quick. No."" So then we started hanging out more, and yeah, we became official like January 4th. So, yeah, we've been together for about two months-- well, we've been dating for about four months, so it's pretty cool, pretty chill. It's pretty nice. I haven't been in a serious relationship in like two years, so I'm like, ""Okay. That's refreshing."""
2018,2020,Interviewer,"Oh, so you think it's serious then."
2020,2024,Subject,"Well, yeah. Why wouldn't it be serious?"
2024,2028,Interviewer,No. You just said that you were just getting back now.
2028,2047,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, you're like, ""You think it's serious."" What do you mean? Why wouldn't it be serious? I'm just like, ""I think it's serious."" I mean, he wanted to start it, so I'm like, ""Okay. I guess he's pretty serious about it."" I mean, I wasn't serious about it at first, but now I got kind of serious about it, and yeah. Committed relationship is nice."
2047,2047.75,Interviewer,Yeah?
2047.75,2048,Subject,Mm-hmm.
2048,2050,Interviewer,What do you like about it?
2050,,Subject,"There's someone to talk to. There's someone to hang out with. Automatically, you got to-- we have a set-up day. Every Friday, we go out and hang out and eat or something. We watch a movie. We catch up. We're texting every day. He's texting me right now. Apparently, he never played Jenga, and I'm just [inaudible] to him like that. And I just like the fact that he's funnier. He just makes me laugh a lot, and it's really nice because I don't laugh a lot, usually, and it's just nice to have that nice little dopamine hit you. I don't know. He just makes me laugh so much. He actually told me a story and like, ""You even laugh when I'm not trying."" I'm just like, ""Is that a bad thing?"" He's like, ""No. Its boosts up my self-esteem. Do it more."" And I'm just like, ""Okay, cool."""
