0.0,5.0,Interviewer,Okay. So the first thing I'll ask you is just how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,10.0,Subject,"A lot better than they've been going in the past, so. I'm kind of just riding that high."
10.0,13.0,Interviewer,Nice. So what's going well?
13.0,97.0,Subject,"So I used to smoke a lot of weed. And I used to just experiment, for lack of a better word, with lots of different things. And for a while, it was like-- I'll go back a little bit further in my life. So I was diagnosed with depression when I was like 16. And so after that, I kind of just picked up the [inaudible]. Oh, I'm depressed. I can get away with doing basically dumb stuff indefinitely. And so in that kind of mindset, I started just experimenting with different drugs and stuff. Not even experimental. I was just doing drugs for a few years. And then it was all for the sake of kind of feeling something more than just being depressed all the time. And very recently I came to the realization that even though I get this great physical high from it, there's something inside me that's not settled and not at peace. So I decided to kind of just turn back to my religion. I was raised Muslim, and I was always very steadfast to the teaching of Islam and everything. But then there was just this period in the middle where I just kind of gave up on it. And turning back to that, I'm like, ""This is kind of the missing piece for me."" And that's what's settling, all that lack of inner peace. And for the past couple of months, it's been a very enjoyable time for me."
97.0,107.0,Interviewer,That's amazing. What do you think about Islam or religion in general fills that space?
107.0,187.0,Subject,"And just because of the way I was raised and as per my own beliefs, I feel like Islam is the kind of ideal way to live one's life. It's one thing to say it. It's another thing to experience it. So after I started reading more into it and learning more about the religion than I did before, I kind of came to this understanding that it had an answer for even the most trivial problems. And I found that even though it seemed like everything was out of my control-- Islam does state that everything is in the control of God.  But at the same time, it gives you that option to make the choices that you want to make. And I realized that it kind of just gave me what I needed. You have a problem in school, and this is Islam's answer to that. And you have a problem with personal relationships, then Islam has an answer for this. You have a problem with money. Islam has an answer for that. And so I just-- it just keeps telling me more about myself and everything. And I was just telling someone earlier today, Islam is more of a lifestyle than a religion just because of how integrated into every aspect, every life it is. And I guess after experiencing that-- having said it is one thing but then after living it out for the past few months, it's just I really get it. And it makes sense."
187.0,200.0,Interviewer,Nice. So that's a really interesting concept of it being a lifestyle. What do you think makes it feel that way to you?
200.0,295.0,Subject,"Well, so Islam was kind of revealed down through the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. They are three major things that we follow in Islam. There's the Koran which is God's direct revelation-- or main holy text. Then there's the Hadith which is just the sayings of the prophet and the things that he would-- he was narrated to have done. And then there's Sunnah which is-- it's kind of like the Hadith. It's more related to the prophet than to God himself. And it's just the actions-- what he did and how he lived his life. And my mom, always growing up-- she would tell me that if you want to idolize someone in life, then idolize the prophet because he had a way of doing everything the right way. Just interpersonal relationships in terms of finding yourself, in terms of dealing with business, in terms of even-- because the prophet was like-- he was a warrior. He fought in a bunch of wars. He was a businessman. He traded across the Saudi Arabian Peninsula. A little bit further than that. He was obviously a spiritual person because he was a prophet. And through all of that, there was just an example of how he addressed every situation, how forgiving he was and how caring he was. How everything he did was just rooted in a deeper love for God and a deeper love for the people he was interacting with. And so in that-- just because there's so much of an example for me to follow that's why I can confidently say it's a lifestyle because it's just-- if you want to know how to do anything just read about Islam."
295.0,305.0,Interviewer,So can you give me an example of something that has-- that you've read that has guided your life?
305.0,466.0,Subject,"Okay. Anytime I dealt with any problems in my life, just being depressed, I was like, ""Oh, everything is a problem. It's a roadblock and whatnot."" And I would tell all my friends about it. I'd tell my parents about it. I'd talk to therapists about it. And they would give me pretty good advice. But at the end of the day-- in a therapy session, you're supposed to unload your problems on the person across the table or whatever. But in a more personal setting, the more you tell people about your problems, the more you feel like you're burdening them almost. Because if you take on someone else's problems that kind of detracts from your own emotional well-being or stability because you're always hearing about negative things that are going on. So I was like-- it came to a point where I would just not talk to anyone. I was like, ""I can't tell my problems to anyone."" And it's kind of like-- it doesn't even make sense talking about them anymore because it's only going to burden other people and I don't want to do that either. But then I read somewhere that if you have any sort of problems whatsoever, you can just put them all on God and then He'll take care of them in exchange for you doing five things. And those five things are the pillars of Islam, the five core beliefs and actions that you have to do. So I kind of just started doing that. And every time I would pray-- because we have to pray five times a day throughout the day. And so every time I would pray, I would just tell God another one of my problems. And I'd be like, ""Yeah. This is what's going on in my life, and I know You're seeing all of this but I just wanted to tell you myself just help me out here."" And then there's another thing that I've heard from a lot of people that praying is you talking to God. And then reading the Koran is God responding to you. And I always felt like how does that work? It doesn't make sense. If I tell God I have X problem, the Koran's just going to have the exact solution to that. And so I decided to give it a try. And I realized that's exactly what happened in the most unusual way, too. I can't remember any specific issues right now, but I remember I would have a very peculiar kind of specific kind of problem to myself, and I'd be like, ""How is the Koran going to answer this?"" And I would just read the Koran anyway. And I'd just end up reading a part that it answered my question exactly. And I would just sit there for a second. There's just no way that's happening right now. And so I told my mom about it. And she was like, ""Yeah. I've experienced that exact same thing, too."" And I told a couple of my friends, and they were like, ""Yeah. We experienced that."" And none of us can explain it, but it's happening. And so just in that, it was like-- that was one of the main things for me. I was like, ""If that's happening, then there has to be something bigger going on."" And I just kept going more and more into it."
466.0,470.0,Interviewer,That's great. So it sounds like your mom knows also.
470.0,516.0,Subject,"Yeah. My mom actually-- she was born in Pakistan. She came here when she was, I think, in her mid-20s. But she has a master's degree in Islamic studies. So that's kind of why-- I guess even when I was going through all my stuff, I was constantly just being-- hearing it from my mom about you have to pray more. You have to be more religious and everything. And I was like, ""That's probably something everyone's parents say."" And to some extent, yeah, that is. But I also realized she was talking from a place of actually having studied everything and knowing all of that. So I was like-- [inaudible] to my mom, she probably only has my best wishes in mind. And two, this is someone who knows what she's talking about. So I just decided to give it a shot. It took me all the way here."
516.0,527.0,Interviewer,Okay. Cool. And so you said that there was a while where you weren't very religious. Why do you think kind of dropped off like that?
527.0,614.0,Subject,"Well, to me, it was-- in hindsight, I can attribute it all to my own actions because I would do something wrong and I'd be like, ""Oh, why did I get in-- why'd I end up in this bad situation? God is clearly not looking out for me."" But at the moment, it was just-- I wasn't realizing what I was doing to myself and how I was getting myself in those situations. And I was like, ""If there was a God, then He would probably keep me out of these situations."" But then after reading more about religion and everything, it's kind of a contractual thing. You do one thing and then God does the other thing. The whole idea of the covenant and Judaism and Christianity kind of follows through under its own version in Islam. In that you do a certain set of things-- just follow the five pillars of Islam and God takes care of the rest. And the thing about the five pillars is even though it's just five individual things, fasting, testifying your faith, praying five times a day, going on a journey to Saudi Arabia if you're financially available-- financially capable of doing that, and almsgiving. Those are just five individual things, but when I looked into it, there's some integration of that-- each of those things can be expanded to just fill your whole entire life. The nuances of it really make themself evident the more you read it."
614.0,618.0,Interviewer,And do you see yourself maybe making your pilgrimage?
618.0,685.0,Subject,"Eventually yes. I was thinking about it for this summer, but my parents are kind of in the middle of a bunch of different business deals and everything. And they're like, ""It's not an opportune time right now."" But also, they're not fully opposed to it. There's the mandatory pilgrimage that's called the Hajj. And then there's this kind of optional one that you can make whenever you want called the Umrah which is you go through a lot of the same rituals, but there's a different significance to it just because it's not mandatory. And because there are a few more things that you have to do in the Hajj than you don't have to do in an Umrah. And I went to Umrah a couple of years ago. But at the time, I wasn't that into it. I was like, ""We're in a country that doesn't even have fast wifi. Come on. I don't want to be here,"" and everything. And then afterwards, I sat down and thought about it. I just had this incredible opportunity that I was living through that I kind of just go by. So if we don't go on the Hajj this year, I'm trying to convince my parents to at least go on the Umrah. That way I can make my peace with God in a more concrete, tangible way."
685.0,692.0,Interviewer,Wow. And so can you describe a little bit about the differences between the Hajj and the Umrah?
692.0,793.0,Subject,"Well, Umrah can be made at any time throughout the year. Hajj can only be made at the end-- in the very last lunar month. And there are a bunch of rituals that you don't have to do in Umrah. Umrah, you can do it multiple times. Every single day you're there, you can do one Umrah. You can go to the mosque. You can go around the Kaaba seven times. You can go to Medina and visit the prophet's shrine and everything. But the Hajj has very specific prayers. And towards the end of it, there's a pillar-- so there's this story in Islam that the prophet Abraham was walking somewhere and Satan just kept coming up to him and tempting him to do the wrong things. And he was like, ""Just get away from me."" And so I can't remember exactly what happened. But there's a symbolic set of pillars there that are made out of concrete. After you complete the Hajj-- one of the things that you do is you kind of go and you throw rocks at it just to-- a very physical, tangible way of kind of condemning Satan or Shaitan in Arabic. That's one thing that you have to do in Hajj that you don't have to do in Umrah. Also, in Hajj, actually, you, at the end of it, shave your head just as a symbolic start, a new start and whatnot. But in Umrah, it's just you symbolically cut off a little bit of your hair, get a light haircut. Those are just some of the nuances. I haven't really read up on it too much because I'm still getting back into the throe of things. But I'm sure if I look, I'll find tons and tons of individual differences."
793.0,799.0,Interviewer,So you said you're getting back into the swing of it. When you were little were you very religious?
799.0,860.0,Subject,"Yeah. Just because of the way my mom raised me. And at that time, I was kind of like-- I was too young to make my own decisions. And I was like, ""I'll just do whatever she's telling me,"" because I didn't know any better. But then the more I realize it now, I just kind of came to the conclusion she was telling me the things that I needed to know. Even though I didn't know any better, she was telling me the best thing for me. For a while, I was like, ""Yeah. Okay. There's no one looking out for me. There's no higher power. And even if there is, I'm kind of apathetic towards their existence."" But even when I use to consider myself agnostic, there was always a teeny, teeny part of me that was, ""You don't know what you're talking about. You know very well that there is a higher power and whatnot."" I never fully left Islam. I would always feel like I was doing the wrong thing in the context of my religion even when I wasn't religious per se."
860.0,872.0,Interviewer,So you think you could point to a point in time where you realized that you had to go back to Islam?
872.0,1158.0,Subject,"I kind of started making actual changes just a couple of months ago, so it's very recent. I'm just trying to keep it going as much as I can hopefully for the rest of my life. But it kind of happened-- I had the realization after-- sometime last semester. So I was looking on campus for a semester just for the sake of doing it for-- because I live very close to Fordham where I go to school. And so I was like, ""Instead of living at home for four years, let me at least get this experience."" And through an RA position, I didn't have to pay for it or anything. So I was like, ""Might as well hop on this."" So it was during a party one day-- well, actually, now that you think about it, in September, one of my friends, Mobean, he and I-- we're kind of in the same boat in terms of just our beliefs and our actions and everything. And so we went to Yale for a debate tournament that we were getting paid to judge because I did debate in high school. And they were like, ""Do you have any other people that'd be willing to judge?"" I was like, ""Yeah. These guys."" And so I brought them along with me. And then one night after an unholy amount of drinking, we were just walking around campus. And then he just started talking. He started asking very unusual questions. He was asking questions about wavelengths of light and how light can't exist without darkness. And I was like, ""What is this dude talking about?"" But my other friend was more opposed to it. I was kind of like, ""Let's just see where this goes."" He was like, ""Are you going to stop talking about this stuff? It's tripping me out. I'm not sober enough for this and whatnot."" So he went back to where we were staying for the night. And then Mobean and I kind of spent like two or three hours just walking around campus. And he explained everything to me. And he was like, ""Yeah. You know what I've been doing for the past few years. And you know that we're in the same boat. But I've kind of found that this is actually the way to go. And that you got to change your thoughts. You got to change your actions."" And just seeing him so at peace with himself after knowing him for three years to be quite the opposite was kind of a jarring moment for me because I was like, ""If this kid can do it, then it has to count for something."" So I started kind of thinking about it then. I started praying a little bit more then, a couple of times a day, three times a day, something like that. And then I would stop and just-- a couple of weeks would go by when I wouldn't pray and whatnot. After we talked, I stopped smoking, stopped drinking and everything. And I was like, ""All right. I can just kind of like put this behind me."" But then because I was living on campus and everyone was already drinking and smoking there and I was kind of the biggest enabler in that I was just always like, ""All right. Let's pack several bongs at once and let's just go down the line."" And everyone was like, ""Yeah. This guy."" But that was kind of like-- the environment was one where I could get away with all of that. But then there was one day when I was-- we had a bunch of people over in our room, and I was just kind of sitting on a couch smoking. And I thought about it to myself, and I was like, ""Yeah. This isn't sustainable. I can't keep doing this."" Even if in a non-religious context outside of college, at some point, I'd have to stop smoking and I'd have to stop drinking. And I realized, for me, religion was actually the thing that helped me stop smoking because I went from basically being high for three and a half years straight without a break quite literally. Because I had a vape pen and I could just hit that at any time. From the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed, I was just kind of out of it. And I was like-- it's more or less an addiction. It quite literally is an addiction. And I was like-- I've tried other ways. I've tried weaning myself off. I've tried replacing it with outdoor activities. But then I realized every time I would go hiking or something, I would also be rolling weed. We got to smoke before we're going to go hiking just to enjoy it more. But that was what kind of helped me stop it. So I started thinking about it more and more towards December. And then just I think late March-- or early March. Somewhere around then, I was like, ""All right. So I just got to cut it out now."" And then I read somewhere that you can't pray if you're intoxicated. So I was like-- it's decision between whether I want to smoke or whether I want to pray. And there's a clear, obvious choice about which one is better and which one is more beneficial. So I was like, ""If I want to do this, then I can't do this."" And I just kind of cut it. And then one day, I just stopped smoking. Just haven't started ever since."
1158.0,1162.0,Interviewer,Cold turkey. Wow. Do you feel different?
1162.0,1259.0,Subject,"A lot different. Yeah. It's not very obvious. There are still times when I'm super stressed out and super worried because I do have anxiety and that's a natural thing for me. And I'm used to that. But I realize it's just so much easier to deal with everything when you have a clear head and when you can actually think about-- when your thoughts aren't kind of trapped in a cage of just the same things circling around. Oh, this is bad. This is bad. This is what I got to do to fix it, but I also want to smoke more. And if I smoke more, I can't fix it. So I'll just smoke and push the problems away till later. And it was like-- I didn't want to keep having those same thoughts over and over again. And I was like, ""I guess this is a much better way of living."" I'm also doing a study with Dr. Herrera about the psychosis symptoms. I had a lot of weird kind of almost hallucination-like symptoms where I would see things out of the corner of my eye. I have done psychedelics in the past. And so those are-- I could attribute those to psychedelic flashbacks and whatnot, but I also know that even before then-- before I started dropping acid or whatever, I would see things out of the corner of my eyes or I'd hear things or I'd just have paranoid kind of almost illusions that-- oh, someone is following me. Someone is out to get me. And I was like, ""These things are objectively not true. But the more that I keep smoking, the more they become a part of my reality."" So that was another big factor for me. I was like, ""If I want to keep my head about me, I kind of have to just cut it out."""
1259.0,1263.0,Interviewer,So you were experiencing these things even before you were smoking?
1263.0,1265.0,Subject,Before I started doing psychedelics.
1265.0,1288.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Weed can make you paranoid [laughter]. Interesting. I mean, it seems like you have a pretty supportive group of friends especially the one person who kind of went through this journey with you. What else do you like to do with him or any of your other friends?"
1288.0,1414.0,Subject,"Well, I kind of-- I'm kind of like Dr. Frankenstein in that I made all of my friends the heavy smokers and drinkers they are because they would just be like, ""Oh, this kid's doing it. Why can't we?"" And I was like, ""Yeah, come on. Let's do it."" I'm kind of getting everyone out of that same rut the same way I got them in. But at the same time, I spend more time with myself these days. I try to go back to things I did before all of whatever happened happened. So back in high school, I was very into programming and graphic design. I was part of our school's media club. We would do daily video announcements instead of just over the loudspeaker. I'd video and photograph school events and stuff like that. So I was like, ""This is a good way to pass my time when I'm not-- instead of smoking or something."" And I'm kind of just getting back into that. So I recently just finished working on a website for one of my friends for their clothing company and just got another referral for another website. So I'm just going to take that and I guess keep making money doing what I like doing. Also just exploring more things about myself. I've started spending more time outdoors. I started more physical activity. And by that, I mean I just play a lot of frisbee. Because my other friend, he has like five frisbees on him at all times. And I'm like, ""You don't need five. You can have five, but you don't need them all in one place."" He's like, ""No, no, no. We have to bring multiple outside when we go out to play."" And I'm like, ""I don't understand but sure."" But he's clearly very into the sport I guess if it is even a sport. But yeah, I just spend more time outside. I try to go hiking as much as I can. Also biking, two things that rhyme and are equally as enjoyable for me. But yeah, I figure the more I can occupy my mind with just wholesome stuff, being around nature, and being around things that are natural, I could I guess get back in tune with my roots of just being a product of the earth."
1414.0,1418.0,Interviewer,Interesting. So is that what you think draws you to nature?
1418.0,1472.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. And there's also this kind of unadulterated beauty about it. So I go to a lot of forests and a lot of natural state parks and stuff like that. I get to be away from all of the stress and anxiety of just people everywhere and people rushing about their daily lives and just constantly looking down thinking about the next move in their life. And I just get to sit back and destress. Because another thing that Islam taught me was that this life is temporary. Whether or not you believe in an afterlife, we're all going to die. And if you spend your entire life just dedicated to your business or to your job or whatever, then you're going to miss everything that's around you. And again, even if you don't believe in a higher power, there's so much around you to see. And there's so much natural beauty in the world that you can't afford to miss it because you don't get another chance at experiencing it."
1472.0,1478.0,Interviewer,That's beautiful. Are you a New York native?
1478.0,1505.0,Subject,"Yeah. I actually was born in Pakistan. I lived in the Bronx for a couple of years from '98 to 2000. And I've lived in Westchester since. But I go to school in the city, Fordham Lincoln Center. I also go to classes at Rose Hill, which is their Bronx campus. My dad operates his business out of the Bronx and in Manhattan, so since I'm involved in that, I'm always in the city at all times."
1505.0,1506.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you're involved in your dad's business?"
1506.0,1526.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. Because he's like 58 now and he, a few years ago, was like, ""I'm getting close to retirement. Let me just teach you what I've been doing so that you can carry it on."" And I was like, ""This is not a bad thing to learn because it's pre-established. It's making a good amount of money. I can inherit it all. And if I know how to do it right, then I can make it even better then."""
1526.0,1527.0,Interviewer,So what does he do?
1527.0,1572.0,Subject,"He's a property manager and a private contractor. And so he's just been taking me to different job sites and showing me how he manages the workers there and how he manages spreadsheets and all this stuff, like expense reports and stuff for his buildings. And so basically, it's come to a point where my dad just does all the outside work, and he's like, ""Here's like 7,000 pages of paperwork. That's your job for today."" And I'm like, ""All right."" And it's a little bit mundane at times. But at the same time, I'm like, ""This is very--"" it's kind of a baptism by fire thing. You'll learn it by doing it. And then any mistakes I made, my dad's just like, ""Yeah. So this is what you shouldn't have done, and this is what you should do."" And then I just try to rectify that my next time around."
1572.0,1576.0,Interviewer,Wow. Are you guys close? Sounds like it.
1576.0,1604.0,Subject,"Yeah. We've been getting a lot closer. We had our fair share of problems but who doesn't? But I've been taking the past few years to kind of just pick up the pieces of the mess I made and just kind of regroup my entire life in every aspect of it. And in that, my parents and I have gotten really close. My sisters have started opening up to me a lot more. It makes me feel good that I can I guess be there for my family the same way that they've been there for me the entire time."
1604.0,1609.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so sweet. Are your sisters older or younger?"
1609.0,1655.0,Subject,"I have one that's three years older and one that's a year younger. And so the one that's older than me is-- she's very individualistic. She kind of does her own thing without caring about what anyone else does or says. And then my younger sister almost copies everything I do. And so at one point, I was like, ""If I keep doing this, she's going to start smoking, too. She's going to turn to destructive coping mechanisms and just spiral out of control. Or if she's already copying what I do, if I start praying maybe she'll also start praying. And if I start finding other ways to deal with my problems and taking a more positive outlook on life maybe she'll also do the same."" And so just that way I'm trying to influence her and nudge her in the right direction as much as I can."
1655.0,1657.0,Interviewer,Sounds like you're a great role model.
1657.0,1658.0,Subject,I try.
1658.0,1664.0,Interviewer,It sounds like you're on a very great path.
1664.0,1666.0,Subject,It's a very content state in my life right now.
1666.0,1674.0,Interviewer,That's great. I don't think most people can say that. And so it's nice to hear. So what about the future? What do you think that holds for you?
1674.0,1727.0,Subject,"So right now, I'm a senior at Fordham. I have about a week and a half left so that's its own sort of anxiety-inducing. At one point, I was like, ""Anxiety can either be debilitating or it can be the thing that pushes you forward."" I'm looking at it from the ladder perspective now, and I'm using like-- oh, I'm worried about not having enough time to do this so I might as well just do it now. Get it out of the way and not have to worry about it. And stuff like that. So I'm currently applying to master's programs in psychology so that I can eventually end up in a clinical or a research role. I'm also drawn to teaching. You can probably tell I like talking. I like hearing myself talk. And if I can impart what I know onto other people and change their lives in that way, then I would like nothing more than that."
1727.0,1731.0,Interviewer,And what do you think draws you specifically to psychology?
1731.0,1777.0,Subject,"Well, just because a lot of what I was going through was trying to understand myself and in doing so, I started picking up cues from other people. And instead of turning inwards like I wanted to, I ended up going outwards and just saying, ""Oh, this person does this. This person does that."" And just trying to combine all of that into my own personality. But then I realize everyone has their own thing. You can't take cues from other people. And just in trying to learn more about the way I think, the way people behave, the way people act, what drives them to do certain things, I was like, ""This is pretty cool."" And especially because now I know that as a therapist or as someone with an advanced psychology degree, I'm in a position where I can potentially help someone with the same problems as myself."
