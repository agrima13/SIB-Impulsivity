31.0,34.0,Subject,Yeah.
34.0,35.0,Interviewer,What does that mean?
35.0,51.0,Subject,"I stay home. I don't go out. I stay home. I play video games a lot, and I go to sleep. I've been sleeping too much so that's why I think I'm lazy."

82.0,84.0,Interviewer,What is combinations?
84.0,101.0,Subject,"Different moves they can use. You know how you-- me, I play video games [inaudible]. I just press all of the buttons and hope I win [laughter]. Now, [inaudible] you do this or you do that and how to do it."
101.0,120.0,Interviewer,That's very loud. And how long have you been playing video games?
120.0,138.0,Subject,I actually remember the first video game I got. It was Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. I [learned?] it for my PlayStation 2. My cousin gave it to me. Yeah. That game was fun. My first video game system was a [inaudible].

139.0,151.0,Subject,The PlayStation 2? There's [inaudible] a difference [in any of them?] except some of [inaudible].
151.0,158.0,Interviewer,And what do you like about playing video games?
158.0,173.0,Subject,I have no clue. It just makes my spare time go by fast. I don't like having spare time. I don't do nothing.
173.0,182.0,Interviewer,And what do you mean you do nothing?
182.0,190.0,Subject,That's the only thing I do in my spare time is that. I'm not really interested in anything.
190.0,191.75,Interviewer,Are you in school?
191.75,192.0,Subject,Yeah.
192.0,195.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you're off for the summer?
195.0,195.75,Subject,Not yet.
195.75,196.0,Interviewer,No?
196.0,197.0,Subject,One more month.
197.0,200.0,Interviewer,Oh my goodness.
200.0,209.0,Subject,"Actually like two more weeks. I'm happy I'm getting out soon. Not that's I'm passing 100%, but."
209.0,210.0,Interviewer,You are?
210.0,211.0,Subject,No.
211.0,213.0,Interviewer,No.
213.0,220.0,Subject,"But the past two months since I got back to school, the teacher said I'm doing good. So I'm happy about that."
220.0,222.0,Interviewer,That's great.
222.0,235.0,Subject,Why are they fighting on the street for? Just pushing each other around. You don't do that in public especially between friends.
235.0,236.0,Interviewer,That's interesting.
236.0,244.0,Subject,"If they're brothers, they shouldn't. I would know if [inaudible] family or friends outside."
244.0,249.0,Interviewer,Why do you say outside specifically?
249.0,281.0,Subject,"Outside, everything knows everybody else's business. And you don't know who will not get attention that's not wanted. You don't want attention fighting. You don't want to-- because a lot of people, they like fighting [inaudible] attention from that, but. Doing anything you're not supposed to do. You shouldn't be doing that [inaudible] especially fighting and stuff like that."
281.0,287.0,Interviewer,So why do you think it's so bad to fight?
287.0,312.0,Subject,"To fight or to argue outside? Because then it's making whoever you're arguing with or even yourself [inaudible] showing them what you get mad about, you get sad about. You're telling them too much about your personal life. You're showing too much of your personal life. [inaudible] telling everybody [inaudible]."
312.0,317.0,Interviewer,Do you think fighting inside is better?
317.0,341.0,Subject,"Fighting should never be a option. But you have a sit-down and you talk about it. You see if there's a way you can both find common ground, and you keep on going. You find out how to regulate the problem and that's it. Everything could be self-talking."
341.0,346.0,Interviewer,Has that been your experience?
346.0,360.0,Subject,Since two years ago-- or one year ago. I'm not really too [inaudible]. I sort of just changed and then keep everything because it works well. So I don't remember.
360.0,362.0,Interviewer,What do you mean?
362.0,382.0,Subject,"I don't know. Just arguing, fighting, all that wasn't good. So I don't do that no more, but I don't remember exactly when I stopped liking it. I mean, I never liked it. I never liked fighting. I never liked arguing. I [notice?] how to control myself better."
382.0,387.0,Interviewer,"And so before, did you used to get into fights?"
387.0,400.0,Subject,"A little bit. Not too much, though. I never looked for problems. So no, I really don't have any problems."
400.0,404.0,Interviewer,What kinds of things would make you upset?
404.0,406.0,Subject,Nothing gets me upset.
406.0,411.0,Interviewer,Not now but what about before?
411.0,433.0,Subject,"Disloyalty, not being honest, not giving me respect I give you. That's it. They're not in order, though, because those three are [both?] the most important [inaudible]."
433.0,439.0,Interviewer,Why do you think they're the most important?
439.0,455.0,Subject,"I don't know. I always thought loyalty, respect, and honesty was the most important things."
455.0,461.0,Interviewer,I wonder why that is.
461.0,463.0,Subject,I don't know.
463.0,468.0,Interviewer,Is it something you grew up with? Is it something you thought of on your own?
468.0,475.0,Subject,I think of most of the [ones?] that I have on my own.
475.0,488.0,Interviewer,And can you think back to a time when you thought of something on your own?
488.0,490.0,Subject,I think of new things all the time.
490.0,498.0,Interviewer,Hmm? Like what?
498.0,521.0,Subject,"Like in school, I learned the word obtrusive. And then I also put in there, don't be obtrusive. It's a few [papers?] [inaudible] that I put every little rule I have for myself to remember-- I wrote on that paper."
521.0,522.0,Interviewer,Why do you do that?
522.0,538.0,Subject,Just to have [inaudible] set of rules for myself. I put [out orders?] in life is what is the most important thing.
538.0,540.0,Interviewer,Why do you say that?
540.0,568.0,Subject,"I don't know. It's just how I-- order is important. You can't do nothing without it. If there's a business-- you're running a business, there's not a specific order. There's not a person in charge. There's not people to do every little specific job. It's going to be harder to get everything done, and there's a higher chance it won't get done."
568.0,583.0,Interviewer,Right. And that's when a lot of people have to work together. What about just for yourself?
583.0,606.0,Subject,"Just maintaining a good image. I never heard anything bad from anybody but myself. Not from my mom's friends, not from my dad's friends, not [inaudible] to talk about. But not from any of them. My mom always tells me, ""[inaudible], I heard good things from the teachers."" I thought the teachers [have had it?]. I thought the teachers did not like me at all."
606.0,608.0,Interviewer,Why?
608.0,627.0,Subject,"I don't know. I don't know if people like me or not. I just decide that I'm [inaudible]. And I'm like, ""If they don't like me [inaudible]."" Some people get mad about it because some people are like, ""No, I wasn't mad at you at all."" But I go by what [inaudible]."
627.0,629.0,Interviewer,Does that happen a lot?
629.0,630.0,Subject,All the time.
630.0,631.0,Interviewer,Really?
631.0,632.0,Subject,Yeah.
632.0,642.0,Interviewer,Interesting. What kinds of things make you think that people are mad at you?
642.0,684.0,Subject,"Sometimes, some people might say, ""I don't like this."" If I'm doing that, I'm just going to separate myself. I don't want to be in some-- I don't want to do something you don't like. I'd still be around you because you find out this or that. I don't want to have that extra conversation. So I just cut it off. [inaudible]. No. He doesn't wear glasses. This guy."
684.0,687.0,Interviewer,Who did you see out there?
687.0,689.75,Subject,My buddy. He looked like somebody.
689.75,690.0,Interviewer,"Oh, really?"
690.0,697.0,Subject,Yes. A friend of mine.
697.0,698.0,Interviewer,It's a busy street.
698.0,699.0,Subject,"Not a good friend, but."
699.0,701.0,Interviewer,Not a good friend.
701.0,702.0,Subject,He's my friend.
702.0,705.0,Interviewer,What does that mean?
705.0,714.0,Subject,"He's not really my friend, but I never mad at anybody. Everybody's my friend."
714.0,722.0,Interviewer,What makes him not a very good friend?
722.0,725.0,Subject,I wouldn't be able to [inaudible].
725.0,741.0,Interviewer,Really? Okay. So you're back in school. Are you enjoying it?
741.0,764.0,Subject,"One thing I [inaudible]. It's all right. It's all right. I notice I was being a hypocrite in the way that I follow the rules that I made. I used to be really disrespectful to the teachers [inaudible]. One of my top thing is respect. Now, I'm just following through with everything."
764.0,772.0,Interviewer,That's great. And why have you never really liked school?
772.0,795.0,Subject,All the people in there. I don't know. [inaudible]. I like people [inaudible]. Not general people but-- yeah. I don't know. I just don't like being around a lot of people. School has too much people [inaudible] kids.
795.0,799.0,Interviewer,How does it make you feel to be around a lot of people?
799.0,804.0,Subject,I get nervous.
804.0,807.0,Interviewer,Do you know why?
807.0,815.0,Subject,I know what everybody [inaudible] intentions are.
815.0,827.0,Interviewer,And what do you think might be some of their intentions? Just can you give me an example?
827.0,833.0,Subject,You're with me or against me. My friend or you against me? [inaudible].
833.0,835.0,Interviewer,But what is against you mean?
835.0,871.0,Subject,"I'm cool with everybody. I never look for problems. I don't see why anybody wouldn't be. Not even really a friend, just be cool with me. Have the same respect I give them. There are some people if you don't do that, then you're against me. You haven't shown me any respect, and I show everybody respect. So if you haven't shown me respect, [inaudible] it's a problem. Not a problem like, ""Yeah, I'm going to be mad at you, but I notice how you're acting and I feel bad. I'm not going to talk you. I'm not going to associate with you."""
871.0,873.0,Interviewer,That sounds fair.
873.0,875.0,Subject,I try to be as straight as I can.
875.0,881.0,Interviewer,That's nice. And do you think a lot of people at school are like that?
881.0,882.0,Subject,Like what?
882.0,886.0,Interviewer,Disrespectful against you.
886.0,910.0,Subject,"Not [inaudible]. I don't know. I couldn't [either?]. But they are very loud and obnoxious. And I write that I learned in school that [they're?] like-- they're obtrusive, too. I like that word. Not because I am. Although I try my hardest not to [inaudible]. There's a lot of people that are, and that's not good."
910.0,911.0,Interviewer,In your business?
911.0,913.0,Subject,What business?
913.0,914.0,Interviewer,They're in your business.
914.0,917.0,Subject,Oh yeah. Yeah.
917.0,921.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That happens.
921.0,929.75,Subject,"Obtrusive, they attract too much attention [inaudible]. I never liked attention."
929.75,930.0,Interviewer,You don't like attention?
930.0,931.0,Subject,I don't.
931.0,945.0,Interviewer,Interesting. And so why don't you tell me what your plans are moving forward? You're going to finish up the school year. Do you have any plans for the summer?
945.0,955.0,Subject,"Yeah. I might work this summer. But yeah, I'm going to work this summer. That's all. That's all."
955.0,956.0,Interviewer,What do you think you'll do?
956.0,970.0,Subject,"I have no clue. I still got to go to the thing, the placement job thing. You choose what job or something like that. [inaudible]. It's my first time working [inaudible]."
970.0,972.0,Interviewer,Nervous?

1003.0,1004.0,Subject,I would be a doctor or nurse.

1084.0,1100.0,Subject,I don't know. I don't know. I guess I kind of liked it but I kind of didn't. It was a good time but a bad time at the same time.

1105.0,1113.0,Subject,A lot of things really good. I'm not going to lie but not because he was in the hospital. It was other things that happened during that summer.
