tmin,tmax,speaker,message
1.0,5.0,Interviewer,Okay. So the first thing I need to just ask you is how have things been going for you?
5.0,11.0,Subject,"Good, I think. I guess, for now. Yeah [laughter]. "
11.0,12.0,Interviewer,For now?
12.0,24.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, I'm in school. I mean, school's ending. I still have one final tomorrow, and then I'm leaving next week to go back home, because I'm not from here, for a month. Yeah. "
24.0,26.0,Interviewer,All right then. And where is home?
26.0,45.0,Subject,"Well, my home is Hong Kong. I grew up there. I just came here for college. But, basically, yeah, I'm going home. I'm going to visit some family. I'm going to eat a lot of food. I'm also going to be traveling for five days, with my mom, to Japan for a bit. And that's it. Yeah. "
45.0,50.0,Interviewer,Nice. And what are you guys doing in Japan?
50.0,167.0,Subject,"Well, my mom's not working. She doesn't quite need to work now because my brother's graduated too. So my brother's already working. He's older than me. So my mom's been really into a lot of hobbies. She got a certificate to be a barista. She makes cookies in the shape of cartoon characters and then try to make meringues in cartoon characters and shapes as well. And she also learned how to do those floral decoration stuff. She took classes. [inaudible]. So she's really into these kind of arts and things. And she's been looking into traditional Japanese treats recently. And also, they have a very rich culture of flower ceremony type of thing. So I'm going to go there.  Basically, I'm taking her there to see a lot of that stuff. And she hasn't been there in 20 years after she gave birth to me. So she was pregnant with me when she went, and so she has never been. And, originally, it was going to be-- I was going to go alone to see my professor there. But after talking to my mom, my mom's like, ""Oh, you can go. I really want to go too, but you can go."" Yeah. So my brother and I decided [inaudible]. And it's not like my mom's going there to sightsee. Of course, she's going to sightsee. It's just she also would benefit from her hobbies. She wants to have her time, [inaudible], want to sell some of the treats that she makes, so it'll be beneficial for her to go there and then see what they do with their artistic treats or whatever and coffee that they do. So my brother and I decided to chip in and treat her to go there for her present."
167.0,176.0,Interviewer,That's a nice story [laughter]. I like that. That's awesome. And you said you're going to see your professor.
176.0,195.0,Subject,
195.0,197.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Of course. 
197.0,211.0,Subject,"And I don't want to be-- and I'm from Hong Kong, so I'm going to be back anyway. And it's like from Hong Kong to Japan, how much is it? It's like $200 or less. "
211.0,212.0,Interviewer,Wow.
212.0,247.0,Subject,"And then the program is like four weeks, but it's going to be like 20K or something. And then I was just like, ""I want to go there and see you for a day or two,"" and that's why I'm going there. And she's been good, and I've been learning Japanese. But I don't see her anymore because I transferred school. So I used to study at FIT, and then I decided not to. And then I transferred to Hunter for another major. Yeah. "
247.0,250.0,Interviewer,So what made you switch?
250.0,317.0,Subject,"It's just it's hard. I met really great people there, and all my really good friends are from FIT. So what I studied is fashion business management. So it's like the businessy side. And then while I was taking the business classes, I found that, ""Yeah. I'm paying tuition here. At least I want to be challenged in whatever I'm doing. I don't want to learn things-- I don't want to take this one course in my first semester and take the same course the next semester on the same thing."" And it just felt like that for a whole year. But meanwhile, while I was doing that, I was taking a lot of art history classes that I really liked. And I just realized that I might be better off doing art history than I do in fashion business. And so I just-- and then, of course, FIT has a art history program as well. But a degree from FIT with a art history-- a art history degree coming from FIT doesn't sound as good as a art history degree coming from Hunter. So I just decided to transfer. And that's, basically, it [laughter]."
317.0,324.0,Interviewer,Nice. And what do you think draws you to art history?
324.0,397.0,Subject,"Well, I grew up being in art always already. That's the biggest reason why I was in fashion, to be honest. Fashion's such a difficult industry to get in, I thought. And my head said, ""So there's a lot you can learn. And I think I might as well be in the top fashion school in the world to see maybe something that might interest me."" Because I've done art my whole life. I was in performance art. I did visual art. I have won awards. I was performing. I just never got in touch with fashion. I don't know what fashion is. So getting into FIT, I was like, ""Okay. Maybe it's a good opportunity to get to know what fashion is, and maybe it works out."" My first job going-- my dream job, I was like,"" I want to be a fashion designer,"" and all that stuff. And, of course, the older you get, you realize that's not going to be possible to a certain extent. But then still I wanted to see what it is about. I wanted to be in business and see what I can do. So that's why I was there. Sorry, what was the question again [laughter]?"
397.0,398.0,Interviewer,"No, we're just talking about art history. "
398.0,533.0,Subject,"Yeah. Oh, yeah. And then later, I-- so I took art history classes. I really didn't think I was art history material because I didn't grow up being the best in class. I took history in high school, and I was definitely not the best in class. And I didn't think that I would be good at it too. I didn't think I would want to do art history or some form of history for four more years of my life seeing that I'm not going to be the best that I could be. But after taking my courses in FIT on art history, I realized that I really like it so much. And some people have a difficulty remembering images with names and then recalling facts and stuff [laughter], and I just kind of am very natural at it and whatever. The professor says I remember quite vividly too. So it just came so easily to me compared to those business laws and whatever that I need to do. And so I was pretty hesitant about it. I was like, ""Do I want to--"" I mean, I could be in art history. But if I was just going to be a gallery assistant or nothing, like I want to be a writer of art, I don't really need to study art history at a better college. I can just stay at FIT and do art history, right?  So last summer, I took an internship at an archive where they do academic stuff for art. So it was a good opportunity for me to see, ""Oh, do I pursue academically in art history? Or maybe I can just stay in FIT, do art history kind of, but getting out of it, just doing a regular purposes job related to art."" But then I really liked it there, and I realized what kind of roles-- through that organization, I realized what kind of roles that it is possible for me to do. And I thought, ""Well, okay. I might actually go all the way, take a PhD, and then do the whole thing and get into a museum and be an important person."" So I transferred just in spring. So I just started in a new college this spring. Yeah. But yeah. "
533.0,534.0,Interviewer,That's a big change. 
534.0,536.0,Subject,Yeah. That was stressful. 
536.0,537.0,Interviewer,"Oh, it was stressful?"
537.0,568.0,Subject,"It was stressful because the transfer deadline-- so they were like, ""Oh, if you apply by this date, you're going to get-- you're going to get your-- you're going to get your notification back by November."" I'm like, ""Cool."" So I applied on this date. But then they ended up saying, ""Oh, you applied on this date but didn't process until two days later, so you're in the second batch."" And I literally got my acceptance two weeks before school started. "
568.0,569.0,Interviewer,Wow. Excuse me.
569.0,602.0,Subject,"I know. And it was really stressful because well, my family's having problem financially. So it was just like, ""How am I going to pay my tuition? Which tuition am I paying? Am I going to FIT or going to Hunter?"" And also, being an international student, all the legal document stuff. How is it going to-- I need to notify both schools of where I'm going, and if I would have stayed at FIT and then signed up for classes. But I didn't because I was like, ""I'm going to go Hunter. I'm not going to sign for classes."" So it was just very stressful at the time. Yeah. "
602.0,603.0,Interviewer,But it worked out.
603.0,630.0,Subject,"It worked out. Thank God. And I mean, the thing that I hate is things like this, like, ""You told me it was going to be November, and you asked me to pay for three months almost."" And then it didn't happen. I hate things that are unplanned because I like things that are-- I'm not the neatest person, but there are certain things that need to be planned out in my opinion. So yeah."
630.0,631.0,Interviewer,Uncertainty is really hard. 
631.0,643.0,Subject,Yeah. Especially uncertainty that I cannot control. That's really what I mostly worry about my entire life. 
643.0,644.0,Interviewer,Your whole life?
644.0,670.0,Subject,"Well, yeah, more recently, I think, after moving here. There's more uncertainty here. There's just the idea of, ""Oh, am I going to make it here? Am I going to still be in school?"" And stuff like that. ""Am I going to have a new apartment? Am I going to be able to afford the new apartment? Am I going to be able to afford school?"" And yeah, it's just a lot of those kind of uncertainty. "
670.0,688.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean, it's really adult to move to another country and learn to find your way. Wow [laughter]. You've had quite a journey. And did you move to apartments to be closer to Hunter?"
688.0,693.0,Subject,No. I moved to an apartment to save money. 
693.0,694.0,Interviewer,Nice. 
694.0,729.0,Subject,"It was more like I don't-- well, growing up in Hong Kong, it's even busier than it is in New York, so I'm used to the commute. Yeah, I understand some people moving to New York are like, ""I don't like commuting. I hate the subway. I want to live next to where I work. I want to walk,"" and whatever. But I don't have that kind of stigma. So I don't mind commuting as long as it's cheap, I think. And that part kind of-- well, but then I love the apartment. So yeah, that's pretty much it. So the lease is ending soon. I've got to find a new place. And I'm like, ""[inaudible] [laughter]."" "
729.0,737.0,Interviewer,That part's just scary. And so how is Hunter? How are you liking it?
737.0,840.0,Subject,"I do. I like it a lot actually, even though I think it really is a lot of things that I was looking for. I'm paying tuition. I want to be challenged and whatever. If it wasn't challenging, I wouldn't stay in high school. And it was pretty much like that at FIT. I didn't feel challenged. It was too easy to get an A, and everything was just a lot-- I barely used my brain for a lot of stuff. I didn't have to study for my finals and get an A. A lot of things were like, ""You're testing all my common sense."" So I didn't think it was challenging enough for me to pay that much tuition to go. But then being at Hunter, I'm learning a lot of stuff that is really truly beneficial to me in a lot of ways. At least there's a whole faculty, a whole big department of art history professors there that I can communicate with. And there's also just the idea of how it's a bigger college too. So I'm also a big fan of learning a lot of languages. By the time I die, I want to be fluent in 10, if it's possible. I think it's possible. And so there's a bigger language program there too. And then there's a lot more resources for me to become the person that I kind of want to become moving on in my life. And I couldn't really do that being at FIT because there wasn't a lot of people. There are a lot of people that are too dedicated into fashion and not seeing the bigger picture of what the world holds, and being at Hunter really helped me a lot too, even though I don't have a lot of friends there because it's a commuter school, but yeah. "
840.0,842.0,Interviewer,So it is a commuter school?
842.0,844.0,Subject,Yes. So you don't really-- how are you going to--
844.0,845.0,Interviewer,You don't--
845.0,848.0,Subject,--meet people really. 
848.0,851.0,Interviewer,So have you stayed in touch with your friends from FIT then?
851.0,877.0,Subject,"Yes, definitely. I worked in FIT for an on-campus job, and I met so many nice people there, and also, just as friends because it's a small school. And then, literally, if you're in the same major, you're going to see each other one way or the other a lo, so it was always the same group of people. So it's easier to make friends, recognize people's faces at least. Yeah. "
877.0,884.0,Interviewer,Nice. That's awesome. And so you mentioned you might want to get a PhD.
884.0,886.0,Subject,Yeah. 
886.0,890.0,Interviewer,What do you think you'll do with it [laughter]?
890.0,1033.0,Subject,"Well, the joke that we kind of make among art history people in our school is usually any other job, you get a bachelor degree. You can work in a bank or whatever. You just need a bachelor degree. But being in art, you need to work in a museum. A bachelor degree is like a high school degree. You're not getting anywhere. And so a large part of it, I want because of the job title. The job that I want to have requires a PhD, and I want to do it. But a bigger part of it, it's also when I was working at the archive, interning at the archive, I was just learning a lot more about the limitations of languages and how it was easy to-- it's hard enough to translate a book from one language to another. There are already limitations to it. But then if you think of it in the context of, what if it's not a book but if it's art? And because languages interpret differently, there's also that kind of circumstances. And I think it would be a great--  I'm very proud of my culture, of where I'm from as well. And I just think that there's so much more I can learn about and dive into, and hopefully, it will be beneficial or somewhat rewarding for the rest of the art history community as well. And that's what I really want. And maybe PhD is not just a thing for me to get a job, but also something I want to do and contribute to. And oh, my God. If you told me like two years ago, ""In two years, you're going to want to get a PhD,"" I would say, ""You're crazy."" So in high school, I was a lot of things, but I was definitely not a studious person who's interested in reading a lot of books and then getting to do a lot of those things. I was never really one of those people despite I was student council president. The whole school knows about who I am, but never really for academia. It was really just me being there and present all the time. So yeah, the PhD, but it's going to take a while. But yeah, I'm excited though, if it happens [laughter]."
1033.0,1037.0,Interviewer,But you said the job you want requires one. What is that job?
1037.0,1040.0,Subject,It's like curator or director of a museum. 
1040.0,1045.0,Interviewer,Ooh. So what exactly does that person do?
1045.0,1148.0,Subject,"So they oversee. When you go to the Guggenheim or you go to the Met and you see these exhibitions, right, who decided to put that there? And just the idea that if I put this tissue box next to the computer. But what if I put these two things apart, then different [inaudible] works differently, right? But who decided to put things together and paint that wall red instead of blue, to hang the Monet painting on it? There has to be someone to make that kind of decision. And who is the person? And so it's like a group of people really. So they help with coordinating what goes where, and then what works to put on, what kind of message they're trying to teach the public or trying to appeal to - I don't know - the donors or sponsors. So there's a lot of that that goes on. And, of course, you have to-- so, of course, not one director is not going to monitor the whole museum because there are different kind of art within a museum. So that person, at least, has to have a PhD. And, for example, if you're in charge of East Asian art, then you must have some sort of degree in East Asian art to tell me what I should do in displaying East Asian art today and for the next season. So one person has to do that. And yeah, it's also a big part of I know-- so New York is a great place for art, obviously. And so back home, they're actually building a lot of museums-- my God, I did that again. Oh, I did that just now."
1148.0,1149.0,Interviewer,It's all right.
1149.0,1240.0,Subject,"But just that back home, they're building museums now. And a museum is still a system or an infrastructure of the western hemisphere. So it's the idea of-- I just want to go back and give stuff like that too. And there's so much more to do now than before because of people opening up to art and people accepting it more. And yeah, it's just getting the PhD is pretty important too. And for me too, I just think that if I want to make a change, especially, well, my interest lies in modern and contemporary art within the social context of East Asia and how language plays around with it. I mean, East Asia has been around for so long, but how has it been received in the western audience? Things are translated in English, but does that mean what it really means in its mother tongue? And I think there's so much more to talking to it. I mean, I don't know for now. I still have so many years to go. But I just think there's so much. And because of that, I wish to do that, so I can work in an institution that big so I can perhaps make change in the bigger industry by doing so. Yeah. I think that's what I ultimately want, I think."
1240.0,1247.0,Interviewer,And what change specifically do you think you want to see?
1247.0,1323.0,Subject,"I think when you think of-- when you ask a child, ""What is famous art?"" they would throw names out like Picasso and Monet. Of course, they know. But what about the other artists that are working in different regions at the same time that are of the same significance? So I just think that the change I want is perhaps in education because I've always been in education. And it doesn't have to be children education but the general public education of how-- I just want to shift the focus from art only in the West to art as a whole. And my part within that change is to shed more light into East Asian art by really reinterpreting it or reiterating what it really means in the global sphere at the time or what it should mean today and in just a position to like Pablo Picasso were. I think it's important too. It's a big part about representation too, of course. And I think, yeah, that's really important as well to do. Yeah. "
1323.0,1335.0,Interviewer,All right. Cool. It seems I've lost my voice [crosstalk] [laughter]. Very cool. So do you think East Asian art is what you'll kind of have a specialty in? 
1335.0,1504.0,Subject,"Yeah. This is something I have a very strong opinion on, and a lot of people don't agree with me. But I think you should do things that strategically you're in advantage of, right? Kind of if you already speak-- I grew up immersed in East Asia. I grew up in Hong Kong, and with like an hour of East Asian culture together. I am proud to say that I know a lot, right? Even though I don't study it, the basic popular culture, customs, and a little bit of language, I already know quite a bit without even studying it. So I'm already ahead than a regular person on studying it, if you think of it, in a way.  So I find it very funny how some people are not of that culture trying to become a professional in that culture. Does that make sense? Some people like correcting me. They say, ""Oh, no, but they're appreciating culture."" I'm, ""Are you sure?"" You can. But I've seen people who are-- if you're of African descent, but you want to study East Asian art and become a-- sure, but how credible are you in that region? And I met professors, like a Caucasian professor who has a PhD in African art and civilization, but she has never been to Africa.  So that is where I just think that representation also plays such a role in it. And that's why I'm very interested in East Asian art in a way that I know that I have an advantage in it. And I know I can tell people so much more about it because what it has been told for the past decade or two is by people who are not of that culture. So there's so much more that I can do that a lot of other people might not be able to. And that's why I want to step in and do it. And kind of just when you really look at the Guggenheim, really, the lady in charge of the Asian sector is a Caucasian lady. And you just kind of question a lot of these things, right? It's really that you can look Asian but you cannot not be from-- you can grow up in Mexico for all I know. But just the idea of that representation is so important. So that's why I really want to be in East Asia and working in East Asian art. Yeah [laughter]."
1504.0,1536.0,Interviewer,Fair enough. And what do you think-- it's funny that you say all these things. I had a similar experience in college. But do you think that you'd want to work at the Guggenheim? Do you want to work at someplace less traditional or a bit more traditional? 
1536.0,1670.0,Subject,"There's just working in existing museums here. There's so much politics around that I don't understand. What I've heard was there's this lady who worked at the Guggenheim. She worked there for so many years. But because of this patron's daughter needed a job in the Guggenheim so they fired the lady who was working there. But the lady had so much experience, and she'd worked on so many things, that had to retire. So in addition to the patron's daughter, they had to hire two more people for the same position.  It's just there's so many politics here that I don't understand. In New York, there are people like that, of the upper class, and they know a lot of these things that I'm not familiar with because I didn't grow up here. So I'm not confident enough to say I want to work in a traditional museum here. But, of course, if opportunity arises, of course, I'll take it. Of course. But mainly, I want to see what I am-- I guess it's better for me to just go into an institution where I have more freedom and to do what I want and what I want to establish. Even though I can be in the same position, I can be a curator or a director, same title, I can be a rank 4 and go and [inaudible] 16 in the Met. And for me, I feel like the change I want to make, I want to at least have some authority over what I do. So perhaps really not in a traditional museum, I'd say, unless I can acquire a position where I have a say in a lot of things I do. Or else I very much would rather go back home or work on-- or even just start small, work on a new museum and to kind of get my voice out there, what I'm capable of doing, and then go to other places and make other changes. Yeah. "
1670.0,1679.0,Interviewer,Okay. And it seems like you're pretty close to your family? Do they want you to come back? Do they want you--
1679.0,1815.0,Subject,"They do. My mom's very attached, and then my brother and I are very close. So my brother and I are very close. My parents divorced when I was six. So mom really just raised me and my brother. But being as the whole family is so independent individually, despite living in the same house, we barely see each other at all. So my mom is only unemployed quite recently, for the past year or two. But my brother, starting from like second grade, he's been training in swimming. And then he was a natural athlete for a good amount of time during when he was in high school. So he trained since he was in second grade and was never home almost every single day. And he would go, come back at 9:00. And then my mom would come back at 9:00. So before high school, I was home all alone all the time, basically. I took care of myself. I cooked for the family. And so as much as there's like-- and then later on, I had my own stuff to do in high school. So we were quite separate, but then we're always keeping each other-- and it's just funny because we're so independent, but my mom just always looking, ""Well, we have to have dinner together."" Like, ""No, we don't. We don't have time for this. You're not cooking. I'm not cooking."" But I feel like the reason why my family's still so strong is my mom is very clingy, and she just needs everyone to-- she really wants everyone to be together. So I think I'm going to go back. I'm probably going to do my master's back home since it's cheaper, and it's also better for me to be with my family anyway. And then I'm going to come back here. Maybe not going to come back to the States to do my PhD, but definitely, if everything works out, I want to. If I am able to make-- it really depends on if I can make the change I want-- if I can achieve what I want to achieve back home, I would rather stay home, which is, yeah, because my family's there. My favorite foods are there. "
1815.0,1816.0,Interviewer,You don't get good food here?
