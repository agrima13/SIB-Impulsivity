1.0,8.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So the first question that I'll ask is, how have things been going for you lately?"
8.0,29.0,Subject,I don't know. I've been doing decently in school. I could definitely be doing better but I'm getting okay grades. Shall I go into personal details?
29.0,31.0,Interviewer,Yeah. If you're comfortable with that. We'd love to hear.
31.0,130.0,Subject,"Sure. Yeah. So I don't know if you've seen my whole file? So last year in September, I fainted. And then I can't remember the whole night from before when I fainted, past till hours afterwards. And ever since then, my ability to visualize is disappeared virtually. I mean, I still can-- I don't know. I can somewhat picture-- if I wanted to picture a face, I'd be able to picture maybe half of a face at a time. It requires a lot of effort for things to really-- not even as it exists as much as I used to, but for things to come into focus. Yeah. And I think my mental-- my mind's eye was so important for me for idiosyncratic reasons, I guess. And ever since then, I've just not been able to bond with people as well. I don't know. Images were such a big part of my life before because I used to picture everything I did before I did it. "
130.0,135.0,Interviewer,"What do you mean, you used to picture it before you did it?"
135.0,189.0,Subject,"To be honest, I don't really know if it was always. I don't really remember. But I feel like before, say if I wanted to-- if I wanted to pass the ball in basketball, I would picture myself passing the ball. Or if wanted to do some kind of dribble move, I would picture myself doing that dribble move. I don't know. It just felt like I was always forcing myself to do things. I was so hyper-focused on myself and what was going on in my mind. It's like when you think about your breathing and then you have to force yourself to be able to breathe. You have to take deep breaths in, or else it'll feel like you can't. "
189.0,195.0,Interviewer,"So, wow. I mean, this sounds like a big shift for you."
195.0,197.0,Subject,Yeah.
197.0,220.0,Interviewer,"Can you describe a little bit more what it's like now? So, if someone were to ask you to picture an elephant. Is that hard? Or is it actions for yourself?"
220.0,240.0,Subject,"That's hard. I can't really picture an entire elephant at the same time. I can't picture its face and the body at the same time, but I can picture the body and then the face. I can't picture anything that's moving. I can't visualize my memories. That's probably the hardest part. "
240.0,255.0,Interviewer,"Wow. How does that work? So, can you describe a little bit what it used to be like? So you can't play them out now?"
255.0,374.0,Subject,"Yeah. But I can still-- I've still got a really good memory, I think. I can still remember facts from the past and I can still-- oftentimes, it'll even feel like I am picturing a moment from the past, but there's no image there. I think that's a big difference. From what I've been able to read about people online, it says that facts are the most important-- or facts are the best thing that they're able to remember. But I feel like I am really good at remembering past details. Yeah. I mean, rarely will an image just come to me. And if it does, it's very blurry. It makes me wonder if-- I don't know. I don't know if I really have-- so, there is a term for it, called aphantasia. And from what I've been able to read about people, people with full-on aphantasia have absolutely no images. And other people, who I've seen have developed aphantasia as a result of some kind of psychological thing, they have this complete blackness when they close their eyes, there's blackness. They're not able to picture even what I'm able to picture, I assume. So it makes me wonder whether-- I don't know. Whether the solution or cure is closer than I think it is or getting back to full visualization is a possibility. Yeah. So I've been able to-- I spoke to the guy who created the term aphantasia. And he said he's seen visualization return to people where the cause was psychological. So that means a lot. "
374.0,390.0,Interviewer,So does it feel-- how are you feeling about it? That seems like a really hard-- I'm sorry. Do you want me to get you a tissue? No?
414.0,419.0,Subject,I don't really feel there anymore.
419.0,428.0,Interviewer,Where is there?
428.0,474.0,Subject,"Present in my head. I don't know. I feel like my whole system of thinking is so different from everybody else's. And I don't know. I guess just the change from hyper-focused to not having really anything is-- I don't know if I really was as present as I picture myself being, back then. But I definitely know that it was more than it is now. Having gone from hyper-focused to nothing is a big jump, like you said."
474.0,487.0,Interviewer,So you mentioned hyper-focused. How is it affecting your ability to focus specifically?
487.0,490.0,Subject,You mean in general?
490.0,502.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Like you said, you used to be able to focus. Do you know how it's-- it's interesting, this particular aphantasia has been affecting focus."
502.0,687.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I think that-- back to the whole idiosyncratic part of what's going on, so I think it relates more to the idea of-- I think it's less about having pictures themselves, and more about the mind's eye and everything else that can exist in it. I think that also for words, I think I used to be able-- I used to picture every word before I said it, too. I don't really think-- I don't really think I had a voice in my head. Yeah, sure, I could hear things, and if I wanted to sound things out or if I wanted to-- if there was a song stuck in my head, sure, I could hear things. Or even when I would picture my memories, I guess, I was also able to hear. I think I was. My memory isn't this bad for everything memory. I feel like I can remember a lot of details, like unimportant, ridiculous details. But, yeah.  So back to the whole idiosyncratic part. So I believe that I had these non-verbal, visual representations of thoughts maybe. I don't know how to explain that. Do you see how that could-- so I believe that I didn't always put my thoughts into words. And I believe that instead of putting my thoughts into words, I would give myself the non-verbal, visual representations because I had anxiety, I think. I don't know. I think I've been numbing myself for the past four, five years maybe. I don't think I ever really felt it. But I think that when I was able to see the non-verbal thoughts, I could tell that my thought process was very anxiety-ridden. I was always wondering whether I did something wrong. Can I trust the people that I'm with? Do people really like me? Do people really mean what they're saying? And it was such a constant thing. Yeah. So I think that maybe in order to avoid dealing with all the feelings that putting my thoughts into words would give me, I didn't do that. And I instead ended up with all these visual representations of thoughts. That's what sucks the most. Now I don't have access to that. But I still assume that I'm not putting thoughts into words the way that I was before all the anxiety started. So now, I just end up with nothing all the time. I'm very slow."
687.0,705.0,Interviewer,"So when you say that you put things into non-verbal form, were you seeing the words in your mind's eye? What is the non-verbal--?"
705.0,720.0,Subject,"I don't even really know how to describe it. I don't know I could describe it to you, even if I could see it."
720.0,723.0,Interviewer,It's like one of those things that is just-- yeah.
723.0,724.0,Subject,Yeah.
724.0,734.0,Interviewer,"But you said that you had some anxiety. Do you think that's gotten better, worse since this happened?"
734.0,753.0,Subject,"I would say probably worse because now, whenever I feel lightheaded or anything, I feel so super scared. Which makes sense, I guess, in a way if the fainting was a big deal for me."
753.0,758.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I mean it marked the beginning of something that you find really disruptive.
758.0,759.0,Subject,Yeah.
759.0,766.0,Interviewer,"So, of course, that's going to be something that's not difficult. Do you feel dizzy often?"
766.0,840.0,Subject,"No. But whenever I do, I end up feeling-- I don't know. I get really anxious. I start wondering a bunch of what-if, worse-case-scenario thoughts. And yeah, I guess ever since all the-- ever since the anxiety started-- one time I was on a plane, and I had this piece of bread that had pumpkin seed on the bottom, and I'm allergic to pumpkin seeds. And I had a really bad anxiety attack. I ended up having really bad stomach pain, having to go to the bathroom. But they gave me Benadryl. So there's no chance that my throat could have closed up. And they also had a EpiPen there. And I was with a bunch of doctors. So there was probably no chance, but it still felt as if my breathing was-- I don't know. My throat was closing up. It happened to me other times when I've been at my friend's house and eaten other things that I'm allergic to. Yeah. And, yeah. If something feels wrong, I feel like I magnify it, make it worse. Yeah."
840.0,848.0,Interviewer,Do you think all those things are health-related?
848.0,871.0,Subject,"Yeah, but no. I don't know. Maybe I think about social situations and blow them out of proportion, too, or let myself think about it too much. Yeah."
871.0,900.0,Interviewer,"And you mentioned using numbing as a bit of a tool to deal with some of your anxiety and things like that. In these social situations that sometimes maybe you analyze a lot, do you have people in your life that you talk to about these things, that can kind of understand?"
900.0,939.0,Subject,"Yeah. I have friends, and I used to see a psychologist. But we stopped the week after-- I think we met one time after I fainted. And then, my plan was to see a psychiatrist. And then I took medication for, I think, three weeks. And it didn't really do anything for me. And I don't think medication was the answer either because I was numbing myself. Besides, if I had anxiety, I wasn't feeling it. I didn't have anxiety to really deal with."
939.0,975.0,Interviewer,"So they were targeting the anxiety. But I mean, this seems to-- I don't know if medication can help with aphantasia, but it seems like something that's definitely very stressful to go through, and it's changing your perception of how you think and interact with things. What do you think is next?"
975.0,1100.0,Subject,"So I've done a lot of research. I've spoken to a lot of random people. I think that we have to-- I think that we have to try to remember the night. We have to do hypnosis or something like that to-- or if there's another option to remember it, I'll do that too. But I think we have to remember the night. So, the day before I fainted, my mom came to meet with me and my psychologist. And my mom told the-- my mom told the psychologist that she did not want us to meet anymore. And maybe I considered-- maybe I considered her to be really close to me. Or maybe I considered our relationship to be very important to me. And that next night, maybe, I had some kind of-- maybe I was experiencing distressing images about her. Or maybe I was experiencing distressing thoughts about her or something, and that caused me to-- well, to be honest, I'm not sure if it was a fainting or psychogenic blackout. Because my eyes closed, supposedly. And I thought that when you faint-- I thought your eyes were supposed to stay open. But I'm not sure. And I also ended up speaking to this woman about psychogenic blackouts, and it seemed like there were too many-- there were a lot of reasons why it wouldn't have been a psychogenic blackout, but I don't know. There was also, even based on my eating, there was no real reason for me to have fainted. I didn't really eat so well. I hadn't been eating well for a while. I probably had issues with my weight and body image and all that stuff. But yeah, so they couldn't really come up with any kind of reason as to why I fainted at the hospital. "
1100.0,1105.0,Interviewer,Do you think the answer is somewhere within the reason for why that happened?
1105.0,1141.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think that if we can remember the night and remember why I fainted-- I don't know. Maybe we can continue to work with a hypnotist and cognitively restructure it or something. Or if I remember the night, I can even just-- I can just work with a-- I can work with a behavioral therapist or something like that or a psychologist, just to restructure it in my mind. And then, hopefully, whatever is holding me back will disappear."
1141.0,1153.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you know why your mom wanted you to stop seeing that psychologist?
1153.0,1160.0,Subject,She felt like I wasn't making any progress. 
1160.0,1166.0,Interviewer,Did you feel that way?
1166.0,1179.0,Subject,"In terms of knowledge, no. But in terms of actual progress, yes. Yeah."
1179.0,1183.0,Interviewer,"So, can you help me with that distinction?"
1183.0,1232.0,Subject,"Just, I guess, even during that period of time I was still numbing myself. And I don't know, my thinking didn't really get back to the point where I wanted it to go back to. I wasn't experiencing thoughts. I was still experiencing all the non-verbal stuff. I was still experiencing thoughts that weren't the same as they were before my anxiety started. So I felt like there wasn't really-- even though maybe I was becoming more knowledgeable about it, and that's the whole point of cognitive-behavioral therapy, just to realize that what you're thinking is ridiculous or whatever, it didn't have any effect on me. Yeah."
1232.0,1237.0,Interviewer,So but you said that you did feel some sort of progress. What do you think that was?
1237.0,1240.0,Subject,Just becoming more knowledgeable about what's going on.
1240.0,1257.0,Interviewer,Okay. And so you were doing cognitive behavioral therapy. Have you ever considered different types of therapy? Would you consider going to a hypnotist?
1257.0,1262.0,Subject,What other types of therapy would there be?
1262.0,1318.0,Interviewer,"Psychodynamic therapy, where you explore things through talking that's less structured. So I think cognitive-behavioral therapy is fairly disciplined in what it wants you to accomplish. In fact, sometimes you have homework, where it's a bit more structured. It gives you tools to manage symptoms and behaviors that you're experiencing. While I think, psychodynamic therapy looks more at underlying causes. So maybe some other things that you've already explored by yourself. Thinking about, you've done a lot of work, in my mind, coming up with where you think this aphantasia originated and why. And that's kind of more the goal of psychotherapy, is uncovering that and moving on from there."
1318.0,1322.0,Subject,Yeah. I would love to hear what another psychologist has to say or what they think.
1322.0,1325.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I think that could be helpful.
1325.0,1327.0,Subject,Yeah.
1327.0,1357.0,Interviewer,Do you find that talking about these things is-- it seems like you're doing a lot of research on your own. And you seem to be very knowledgeable and really understand what the experts have to say on this. Do you think talking about it helps?
1357.0,1380.0,Subject,"If it's finding a solution, I think I'd be willing to-- I'd be willing to meet with somebody a couple times if it meant them becoming more knowledgeable about me, and them being able to give me a better answer about what's happened. But I don't think that it's cathartic in itself maybe."
1380.0,1410.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you think that-- what do you find the most uplifting thing to be doing now? It seems like you're going through a lot of rough rollercoasters. But what do you do to kind of take a step back from all that?
1410.0,1428.0,Subject,Play basketball. I play video games. Yeah. Spend time online. But that's pretty much it.
1428.0,1435.0,Interviewer,Are you able to think about-- is it something that you just can't think about anything else?
1435.0,1623.0,Subject,"No, I definitely can spend time thinking about other things. I think that it-- I think that it used to be different. It used to be something that I was thinking about for the majority of the day. I tried explaining this to Dr. [Herrera?] too. So I saw a hypnotist a couple times. Probably once in January, a couple times in December. But I didn't go to him with the knowledge that I have now. I didn't know that what was happening was aphantasia or low levels of visual imagery. I think that he told me that it was-- when we were doing the-- when I was hypnotized, I guess, he told me a bunch of, ""You shouldn't be thinking about this. It can only make it worse to think about what's going on."" So I think now I can spend time. Now I can think about other things. I can think about clothes or I can think about my video games or all that stuff. But I feel like, in a way, he's made me even more numb and even more disconnected from my emotions.  So it makes me worried that I don't care about what's going on. And I don't know. When I try to stop thinking about what's going on, it's either because he told me that I wasn't a good idea and I really internalized that. So every time I think about what's going on, I quickly try to get my mind on another thing. I don't know what the reason would be, but I just stopped caring. So one day, I think we met-- me and the hypnotist, we met, and then the next day I woke up, and I just felt like I didn't care. I was numb. And that had happened before, too. That happened probably sometime in the middle of November. But that only lasted for one day, and then I went back to thinking about it all the time. Yeah, there was that one time in late December, where the day after we met, I woke up and I felt numb and I haven't really felt like I cared ever since then. What's weird about it is, I also-- I don't know. I'm obviously doing all the research. I'm obviously putting in a lot of effort to figuring out what's going on. And whenever I think about-- whenever I picture, I don't know, times from the past or how it used to feel to-- in my mind, I always think so highly of it and all that stuff. So I think that I do care on a subconscious level maybe. But maybe I'm not allowing myself to feel it. Just because I feel nothing."
1623.0,1635.0,Interviewer,Do you find that feeling nothing feels better than feeling worried?
1635.0,1698.0,Subject,"Yeah. To be honest, almost pretty much all the time after I fainted, I felt like-- maybe there was a short delay and maybe I was in denial about what was going on or whatever for a period of time after I fainted, directly after. But pretty much for three months straight I felt like crap all day every day. And it affected my ability to eat. Yeah. I knew something where I would seldom be able to forget about it. And if I did forget about it, as soon as I realized I had forgot about it, I would start thinking about it again. Yeah, so in that sense, it is easier. But I do feel like in some ways I prefer to know that I still care. Whichever emotion I could give myself that would tell me that I care, I would take the, I guess, feeling bad all the time like I used to, also [inaudible] good."
1698.0,1711.0,Interviewer,And you remember a time when you didn't have any negative feelings when you didn't have this aphantasia?
1711.0,1762.0,Subject,"Yeah. Probably before I fainted or whatever happened that night. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe my ability to be-- I think that I was a very socially receptive person, maybe. And I don't know. I think I had more of myself to give. But now I don't. That kind of sucks."
1762.0,1777.0,Interviewer,"Are there times you noticed recently when you-- is there something in your conscious thoughts? Have you been in a situation where you kind of thought, ""I wish I could give more of myself.""?"
1777.0,1923.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't know. I feel like I'm kind of a-- I feel like me saying so little sometimes makes me kind of like a-- it makes me feel guilty. It makes me feel like an ass. But I feel like also-- I don't know. There's a rhythm to a conversation. There are things you're-- you're not supposed to chew the person's ear off, I guess. And I don't know. Just not having the non-verbal thoughts in my head or having a regular thought-process makes it harder for me to, I don't know, always be able to get my thoughts across, always be able to say what I'm really thinking in each moment. I feel like oftentimes people will say things that I'm thinking non-verbally, and that sucks when other people react well to it. Or, say, if I'm writing an essay and I don't get my full complete thought process out, I get a lower grade even though I did think all these things but I just-- I suppose sometimes it's different.  Sometimes I am able to get a lot of my-- so, I don't know. Say, if I'm trying to think of people who should be guarding certain people, I'll just picture their faces and then maybe I'll picture the other person's face and then maybe I'll picture a check-mark to say, like, ""Oh, yeah. He can guard that guy,"" if I'm thinking about basketball. There are some times like that. Or when I think about what clothes I want to wear, I can somewhat picture the clothes, and I can somewhat picture the all together. And if I'm thinking about a specific thing, I can think about the two-- if I'm thinking about an outfit or a specific part of an outfit that I like, I can picture those two specific parts together and I can notice the different parts. Say, if I liked the fact that I was wearing a lighter shade of a color and a darker shade of a color, that would stand out to me. So there are ways that I can picture things that help me get more of my thoughts out. But sometimes that's impossible."
1923.0,1941.0,Interviewer,Yeah. You mentioned clothes a couple times. It seems to be something that you enjoy. What do you think makes you happy about thinking about clothes?
1941.0,1968.0,Subject,"I don't know. I just get so excited at new releases and stuff. I think it's difficult to say no to things, things that two weeks later I wouldn't even care about. I bought a lot of things that I don't really like right now. But at the time, I felt like I should buy something."
1968.0,1973.0,Interviewer,What kind of releases? Like the new-line stuff? Yeah.
1973.0,1976.0,Subject,So what are your favorites?
1976.0,1983.0,Interviewer,Probably there is this one brand downtown called Noah NYC. Have you heard of them? No.
1983.0,1996.0,Subject,"Yeah, I really like them. There's another brand that's right across the street from them. That's also really nice. And otherwise, I just-- whatever I can find that I like."
1996.0,2000.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Well, you look amazing."
2000.0,2001.0,Subject,Thanks.
