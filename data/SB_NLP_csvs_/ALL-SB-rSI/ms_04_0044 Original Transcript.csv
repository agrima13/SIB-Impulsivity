0.0,1.0,Interviewer,How have things been going for you lately?
1.0,86.0,Subject,"For the most part, I've been making improvements both in school and both on my head. However, making improvements in terms of just the things I got to do in life in general, just like initiating plans for the future and getting things done right now. But it's just all [calming?] the basic stress that we have to go through, I would say. So it's just things are kind of winding down. And when they wind down, that weight is off your shoulders, and you get a relief that, ""Okay. It's almost over,"" pretty much. And it's like, ""Oh, it's hard work and time, dedication, sweat, and tears, and all those - [you know what I mean?]? - goes into this."" So for the most part, I feel a little more relief. I'd say a little more relief. That's the way to describe myself right now. I'm still kind of tense and all of that. I'm just like, ""I got to get back home and finish this and finish that because one thing is due tomorrow. One thing is due the next day."" I mean, that's just normal when it comes to school in general. But other than that, I'm looking forward to my future. That's the thing that gets me up and makes me smile most at the moment is the future, pretty much. Yeah."
86.0,87.0,Interviewer,"Oh, so it's very exciting."
87.0,88.0,Subject,Yeah.
88.0,95.0,Interviewer,And what do you think is the biggest weight on your shoulders? What's making you the most tense?
95.0,661.0,Subject,"Just like talking to my therapist at the main clinic-- I don't know if I mentioned his name, Carlos Benitez. Yeah. So just [inaudible] with him is just that [inaudible]. I mean, in general, I got back to them. It's not finances or a bill or something like that. You know what I mean? It's very much my head that's worrying me the most because I've been-- well, I've been suffering from kind of this pain that I've been going through. It's [indescribable?], literally. I had food poisoning when I was 18. And that was the worst pain in my life because I couldn't eat. I couldn't eat anything solid. I couldn't sleep, literally, for a week. And I would only drink coconut water. That was the worst pain in my life that's physical pain. It happens and it goes away. But it's just this emotional, mental stress I have. I'd rather describe it as I definitely don't want to go through something like it. I'm only 22, and it's the worst pain that I've ever gone through. That's the hardest thing that I'd go through. And honestly, that scares me.  The thing that terrifies me the most is this uncertainly in my own head because it's like your head makes you who you are. And your thoughts, your consciousness culminates who you are and what you do in life and stuff and your sense of identity. But if I'm not in tune with that, then what can I be in tune with? I think having someone that you can trust, but it's like at times I feel I can't trust it. At times, it brings me whatever is manifesting out of it. It brings me sadness, and it brings me pain. And that's something that I definitely-- that's something I'm definitely scared of, that I'm definitely worried about in the future. And I'm obviously in treatment for it however. But it's like I have been [inaudible] since I've been here, but I've had a lot-- I've had a lot of episodes in varying degree, but they've been mostly the same. The most noticeable ones that happened, they've been very bad. They've been very bad. So I kind of started-- I mean, I was a little bit in denial about it before. Hopefully, this isn't something as bad as it is. And I know the more-- I know the more I seek treatment for it and the more I talk about it, the more we can identify possibly what it is. The thing of it is I've had come to this-- it was hard too because I was in denial about it, but I've kind of come to this understading that it's like there's something that won't go away. I mean, I've even trained it. I kind of keep it well, but I don't think it's something that I-- because I've had very, very happy moments. I've had very happy moments. I've been doing things that I love, just resting. And these moments, they come because there are often triggers and often things that set them off. But when I'm just doing something I'm having absolute fun with or I'm with people that I love, that I care about, it still comes. It still happens. And I'm used to-- I'm used to be-- and I say it like it's a positive thing. Well, I guess it's a normal human experience, like being depressed and having anxiety. I'm used to having-- I'm used to finding moments of being depressed. I'm used to this kind of this tight-chested feeling in my chest, like an overwhelming sensation. I'm used to that. It's just this sudden feeling to not do anything anymore, and I can't think straight, period. And I'm really trying to put my mind back together and think straight and remember what I was doing or remember simple things, and I can't do that. And I've been having very-- and they're not my own thoughts. I know they aren't, but it's like I've been having-- and that alone, even acknowledging it brings me pain that it's like I've had suicidal thoughts, nothing concrete. But it's a thing of like, ""Just don't be here."" It's a feeling of just wanting to stop. It goes on for so long, and it's like I sit there. And I'm trying to reason with myself to feel better, but it's [wild?]. And it's not the same as a physical pain in the body, but it hurts on another kind of level. That's the thing. There's pain out there that's so bad that you'd rather prefer death over experiencing it. And this is going on for a long period of time. I'm not just someone-- in terms of it happens this day. Do you know what I mean? It's what's happening in the moment, and it's lasting much more than 10 minutes, more than 20 minutes, and an hour, and it's like, ""Why won't this go away?"" And you're trying everything in your power to be motivated. And there are things that you still want to do and hang onto in life and do and see, but it's like in front of that is this literal obstacle that's preventing you from going there. You know around that obstacle are these goals that you have in mind that you set for yourself, but this literal obstacle just kind of manifested itself in the way. And it's keeping you from progressing over. And it makes you-- the fact that it's there for so long, it tears at you. And that's kind of what I feel-- not even kind of. I literally describe it as a bunch of hard to put-- internalizing the words.  And I think back to when people are in absolute pain, and it's like a mercy thing-- that's a mercy killing to-- it's the right thing to do because these people are in this excruciating agony. And to lead them in further agony would in itself be more brutal. I'm not just saying like, ""Oh, I'm definitely going to go the next time,"" but that's what I relate to if these moments of, ""I don't want to exist. I want this to stop, but I don't know how to stop it."" But I don't want to experience it because it hurts a lot. And, again, it's not like a physical pain to your body, which a physical pain to your body, I believe, will always be worse because it's the actual damage that's brought upon you from something that's inflicted onto your exterior, and your brain responds, our nervous system, ""Aw, this hurts."" I feel this down here. So I said something very much on a deeper level. And it's agonizing. There a moments where I'm like, ""I feel like it got me. Wait a minute. Okay."" I can push it down. It's like I'm doing something. It just literally comes out of nowhere. And I'm in public, and I'm like, ""Whew."" And I'm not worried about people in public looking at me, and I [don't worry?] like that. But I'm not really worried with people at all looking at me in public. I'm not - what is it? - afraid of crowds or anything like that. Public speaking, that's easy. I mean, I'm not-- many people have lots of big fears if it was public speaking like this. But I'm not ashamed. If I cry in front of people or I'm just going through something in front of somebody, I'm not. It's just I don't want it, like, ""You don't understand."" As much as I don't want to die in front of random people, I don't want to die in front of my loved ones. As much [inaudible] for my loved ones, I don't want to die [inaudible]."
661.0,662.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
662.0,762.0,Subject,"You know what I mean? It's all together. So the same pain that I have here, I think it's worse for my loved ones. I don't want my loved ones to see me dying in front of them or in misery. I don't want them to see that. That makes me more sad if I see I'm bringing you pain now. I don't want to put my pain on you, although you're more than happy to help because you care about me, but I don't want you to experience what I'm experiencing. As much as I don't want to be by myself because I-- I used to be-- I can be by myself or with friends or [inaudible]. And I'm still by myself a lot times. I have to do things. But now I do get worried being by yourself because it happens more often by myself. It does happen where I was by myself. And I feel being like being around other people when I feel that I definitely know something inside-- I know inside of me that I'm with other people. It helps it to not emerge when I'm doing something that I care about. It helps that it doesn't-- when I'm by myself, it's more likely to happen, and it's happened more while I'm by myself."
762.0,767.0,Interviewer,What do you think-- how do you think that works?
767.0,891.0,Subject,"Honestly, I believe it works where my mind cannot be on itself when it's not left alone to its own demises so it can tear itself down. I don't know if I mentioned this to the purposes of this. Everyone's hard at you, your hardest critic, but that was because it was my best friend and my worst enemy. And I boost myself up a lot, and I hated myself a lot. And a lot of that self-deconstruction is criticism on how you could do something better, how you can be better. But there's a difference between-- and that's [right?] in the beginning stages of what I was going through. I thought, ""Oh, maybe I was just out of tune with it. Maybe I was [over-critiquing?] myself. Maybe I was over-upset with myself."" But it's like now, no, because I could be in total bliss, happiness, and it happens. So if it's not me intentionally doing this, then it is something else. Because before, I would say, ""Oh, that's me doing this. This is me."" And the more I think, it's not me doing it. Because if it was me doing it, then I can shut it off at any time. When I'm upset with myself, ""Oh, man,"" I'm beating myself up. I'm like, ""[What?]?"" I'll be blaring some. I just live my-- I mean, literally, die. And sometimes in those moments when I'm experiencing an episode, I have that kind of thing in my head just saying, ""It's over,"" and, ""Go back. Do it."" And I'm really thinking really hard on it, but my body is just-- I can't move. I can't physically do anything. And it's a part of me that's like, ""Oh, just get over it. Just joke it off."" And I can't do that, and that makes me even more-- there's a part of me that knows I can, but I can't do it."
891.0,892.0,Interviewer,What is--?
892.0,893.0,Subject,"But when I'm like-- oh, sorry."
893.0,894.0,Interviewer,No. Go ahead.
894.0,959.0,Subject,"But when my mind on something else, when it's with someone I care about, or I'm doing something that I'm passionate about, it doesn't-- because I'm too busy focused on one thing or other people. So I believe my mind can't dwell and start thinking. But there have been moments where I haven't been thinking that much at all. It just happens. I just feel being around other people or doing things that I care about-- and obviously, that is because it forced this to happen. It has happened a handful of times when I was with other people, not to mention in the crowds, or I was doing something I care about. But it happens more frequently when I'm by myself, and it happens. The impact when I'm alone is worse than when I'm with people or doing something that I care about. Yeah."
959.0,960.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That makes sense.
960.0,962.0,Subject,Yeah.
962.0,969.0,Interviewer,So what is it like to experience an episode? You called it an episode.
969.0,1418.0,Subject,"For now, like I've been mentioning, I don't really self-diagnose. However, I have actually come in for treatment at Mount Sinai for what I believe to be psychosis as the experiences that I've been going through are very reminiscent to it. And they're very akin to the experiences that my own sister has. And my sister is actually diagnosed with PTSD and psychosis. And I've been [looking?] for a sign for her episodes through-- not to say it's one on one, and they're extremely the same. However, what she described to me-- and I've been with her-- because my sister is my older sister. I grew up with her. We're like best friend at times. And it's what she has described to me. I don't how I can internalize that when I was younger. Given that she's described it to me, but I never experience something like that. I've been depressed around that time, but I have not ever experienced that. And learning more about it for the sake of understanding what my sister is going through, I understood more of it just educational-wise. I guess another thing entirely when you're actually going through it and when you start experiencing it for the first time, when I started going through it for the first time, like I mentioned, I believe it just to be me doing it to myself. I believe it was maybe anxiety, or I was overthinking something of the sort. However, the more frequent it happened, I was very much in denial. Not just that I was immediately thinking, ""Oh, it was--"" I didn't know what the hell it was, but it knew it was very different. It was a very different beast than what I experienced in the past. Because I still go through those moments, and when I do, they're not always the same sensation. But I can tell when I'm-- I can tell when I'm very anxious, and I can tell when I have this lack of motivation and sadness. When I have an episode like depression, the lack of motivation is because I'm sad. And that makes me not want to do anything because I have this downward attitude, I would say, if I'm describing it right. When I'm experiencing an episode and the lack of motivation is because I'm not sad, I actually want to do the things that I'm trying to do. However, it literally stops me from doing it. I can't just feel that I could move my body. I can feel it, but I just can't. I just sit in a position that keeps me just very tight and clenched so I can't reach out and grab a pencil and keep writing or keep drawing or typing on a computer, whatever I'm doing for the most part. If I'm standing, I'll slow-- if I'm walking, I'll slow down in my walk, and I'll try to go over to a wall. Whereas if I'm on the sidewalk, someone bumped into me or stopped their pace at my pace, I would just walk at a slower pace at the side of the wall. And I describe it as going to the motions. When I know, it's very automatic. And it's a different automatic where you know is used to going to this environment or wake up at that time. That's your internal clock, how it works with that, or how you have muscle memory. I describe it like going through the motions as just I'm doing it, and I don't want to do it. No. I know I'm doing it, but my body is just moving. There's [inaudible] of me that wants to do it, so I'm just walking to my destination.  However, all the enthusiasm to get there-- there's this thing in me that's too focused on-- there's this thing in me that's too focused on this cramming of thoughts in my head and emotions. I can't focus on one-- I can't focus on, actually, what I will be doing when I get there. I'll be focused on what's happening in the very moment within my own head. And it's like when I get there, I'll just do my best to put myself back on track slowly, commit to planning everything else step by step, I would say. I think in [inaudible] a scenario like I'm going to work or something like that, a job I don't have, right? I'm going to work, and it's an office job. And I know why I'm in this office building. I have to go through the front doors, use my keycard to get it, get in the elevator, press a specific floor, then get to my computer, take my coat off, and then boot up my computer, and then open up a file, right? I know all that in time, right? Because I've done it multiple times. Now if I'm going through it, it's just, ""Okay, get to the building. Okay. I'm at the building. Okay. Now remember get this keycard. Now you have to get in the elevator."" It's not planned. I don't know if it sounds [default?], what I'm describing. But it's like I'm not thinking far ahead anymore. I'm thinking about only in the moment and what scares me about that is I start to forget things. I wouldn't say it's forget. Really, it's an all-time rule or something. Because there's so much that's building up in my head at the moment. There's so much that's going on, and I can only focus on-- I like to believe-- I like to believe-- I like to believe that I'm able to multitask. I'm not ready. And multitasking itself is a great skill. However, focusing on one thing at a time or two things allows you--"
1418.0,1419.0,Interviewer,That's hard.
1419.0,1524.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah. When you're focused on one thing or two things at a time, you're able to finish it quicker. Multitasking is a good skill because you're able to be flexible. I can't even do that when I'm in those moments. I can't think future as well as past. I can remember something that was mentioned beforehand. I can't do that because in the moments, it's only the present. It's only what's happening right now. And what's happening right now is what's happening in my head. So that's why I kind of describe it as going through the motion. I'm not planning things. I just know I have to get here. When I get here, then I do that. Then I do that. But it's a very slow pace. I'm not thinking ahead. I'm not thinking, ""Oh, I got to work. What am I going to eat,"" or, ""I got to work. What can I not wait to do? I can't wait to [lie on my bares?], get on my conscience, pet my dog like that."" It's just, ""Okay. Here's the building."" And that's not the least. It's kind of a drone mentality as if like you're like an ant or something like that. You're like an insect, ""Okay. Go here. Get food. Bring food back to queen,"" a little like that. It's very robotic. Not as if what I'm going through is like a computer, but it's very limiting in terms of what I'm going through like when I have to through something physically, where I have to physically move or maneuver, I would say. Yeah."
1524.0,1534.0,Interviewer,Do you think it's so difficult to plan and multitask because you're distracted by your thoughts?
1534.0,1611.0,Subject,"And during episodes, it's a very different obstacle compared to-- it's a very different obstacle compared to something that's physically in your way because, again, it's something that's almost debilitating from thinking straight. And it's hard for you to-- it's kind of like if you blast music in your ears, and then you're trying to read something at the same time. You know what I mean? Like there's something screaming in your ears, and then you're trying to read from some Shakespeare literature. And that in itself is kind of difficult, being that our dialect is different now compared to back then. I can't tell you the experience is exactly like that, but that's how I describe-- that's how I describe the method of it. It's acknowledging one thing while there's another thing on you simultaneously."
1611.0,1612.0,Interviewer,Okay.
1612.0,1809.0,Subject,"I've experienced [inaudible] these embodied voices that emerge in my head. And at first I believed it to be-- at first I believed it to be sounds that were interior sounds of my apartment, for example, or I thought it was just maybe-- I thought it was maybe just someone in another apartment speaking. I can't ever pin down how the voice literally sounded. If you show me a billion different recordings of voices, I don't think I can ever-- at least in my case. Because I hear it as a voice. I hear it as a voice. And I kind of describe it as possibly my own voice, but it just doesn't sound like my voice because we have our own voices in our heads. You know we think and plan things out, how we talk to ourselves? Why it feels so alien is because I'm not the one initiating the thoughts. I'm not the one creating the-- I'm not the one creating these sentences or these words about doing it. How I can think right now, I just saw a door in my head. I'm looking at the door. You know what I mean? I thought computer. You know what I mean? I related it to something before. It's like a pop-up ad, right? Okay. Right? Okay. Imagine you're on a website, and you're looking at a specific thing. All right. I'm looking up toasters or something, whoever uses toasters in 2019 [laughter]. We have a machine to do that, right? But you're looking up toasters then a pop-up ad comes up for [runs?]. You know what I mean? It's literally on the entire screen, right? But it doesn't stay there. It just pops up and it leaves. That's how I can describe it. It's very intrusive, the thoughts I have. I describe the thoughts and as well as the emotion is very intrusive because it's something very unwanted. And it's something that's literally taking up space within my head. And these voices are-- I'm now being able to-- I'm now being able to actually decipher them a little bit. I've mentioned it before in the beginning. I was able to decipher that some of those voices were harmful, were very destructive negative thoughts. And the [thoughts?] themselves are negative. But they were very much on par with self-hatred or criticism, things that are just [pertinent?] noise, more exaggerated than they had to be."
1809.0,1810.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1810.0,1901.0,Subject,"Now I can feel that they're very much-- when they get to the certain point, I feel their voices. And they're not like I'm speaking to you right now, like, literally, they're that clear. It's definitely just almost like a whisper. It's like a screaming whisper, if that makes sense. There's energy within what's being said. However, it's kind of masked. It's not exactly clear, I guess, if I'm on the phone or it wasn't the same room. It's almost like someone saying it from a distance, but the distance is very close. It's very close in your head, but it's very much there. Before, I related them to just-- before, I related them to just some hopeless words, like entire sentences that were just in the head. Not necessarily that way, they're related to you reaction of a word's meaning, I would say, right? I'll be like, ""Right in front of me is a table, right?"" Words is what we created through language to describe things. You know what I mean? Bless you."
1901.0,1902.0,Interviewer,Excuse me [laughter].
1902.0,1916.0,Subject,"Words is what we describe that make-- if I say table to someone that's obviously Spanish, they don't know what table is. They don't know what I'm talking about. Well, if I say table, when I point this, they say, ""Oh."" They understand that this is my word for table."
1916.0,1917.0,Interviewer,Right.
1917.0,2093.0,Subject,"You know what I mean? And it's like words only have meaning to what you give to them. I look at a table. It's a four-legged piece of furniture that you put stuff on. It wasn't the word. It wasn't the word. It was an experience for me. It's like I didn't do something right, and I didn't hand something in right, for example, an assignment, one time. I then submitted an assignment one time, and the professor gave me time. She said it was fine. She said, ""Just resubmit it."" I submitted it as a wrong document format. And I was a little upset because-- I was a little upset because I went to go-- I went to go hang out with a friend just right after class. I was like, ""No. I was really tired."" And I just wanted to hang out with her for a bit, right? And I got too carried away. I was having a good time. And I sent in the document the wrong way. And then I was having trouble sending it in on my phone because the way how you submit it on your phone is a whole other can or worms. Case in point, the method of sending it on the phone, it was very difficult because the browser was made only for desktops. So I was frustrated with it. And then midnight came, and I was like, ""[inaudible]."" When I got back home-- when I got back home, I sent it in, and the professor didn't grade it. And I was upset because I put a lot of work into it, and I'm like, ""You mean to tell me she didn't grade it."" And it's a very simple, little-- even thinking about it now, that [inaudible]. She still graded it, and then she gave 100 for it, but that was later. It was a week-- not a week. It was maybe four days after. Because she didn't grade no one's work, but I was irrationally thinking that. At that moment, I was being very irrational. I was like, ""Come on, man. Are you serious?"" And I thought on, and I was like, ""Man, I put my work into it. I put my work into it, and she didn't even grade it."" You know what I mean? It was almost like-- you know what I mean? I could have been spending that time with something else if she wasn't going to grade it. And I just switched over from that. I switched over from that. I'm like, ""All right. I'm going to draw for a little bit, right? Just practice drawing for a little bit."" And then for whatever reason, I guess [inaudible]. I mean, I think because I was trying to draw something specific and it wasn't coming out well-- I don't normally get [inaudible] at all. I get pissed off [inaudible]. I guess I was relating the experience of not drawing [laughter]--"
2093.0,2094.0,Interviewer,"Oh, yeah."
2094.0,2156.0,Subject,"--this thing right, to send in that file format in the right way. And I'm just with a pencil, and I was like, ""I'm going to just study what I'm looking at for a second."" And then this sensation of-- it was like failure. It was like shame. It was very much-- it was very much, ""You didn't do it right."" I can describe it as this-- the word was, ""You didn't do it-- you did it wrong. You were wrong."" You know what I mean, right? And that brings a feeling of not being able to do something right. I describe it as-- if someone says, ""Oh, you didn't do this right,"" or, ""That's not quite how I wanted it,"" or, ""You didn't meet the criteria,"" that's a feeling of disappointment now, right?"
2156.0,2157.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
2157.0,2312.0,Subject,"[inaudible] you describe it as, right? So the feeling that I had, it was lingering, and it wasn't like the word popped in my head, like someone sent it to me. It just struck me. It was just disappointment. I was really disappointed, period. I was really disappointed, period. And I wasn't even thinking that hard on it. I wasn't because I was still relating to drawing to the format. And this feeling that just popped in my head was just overwhelming like this dread that just dropped down on me. And it was just disappointment. And I just sat back for a little bit. I just sat back for a little bit. I was like, ""Okay. Just calm down and just relax, relax, relax."" And then I started hearing it. I started hearing this voice that was describing my disappointment. It was like, ""You didn't do that right."" I already knew I didn't do it right, but it's just reinforcing on me. That's not my own thought because I already knew I didn't write it right. And I was kind of over it. But it was like it was very much nailing it into me. In that very moment when I was drawing, I was just calm. I was just listening to a podcast. I was literally just blank. I was like, ""All right. Just sit back for a bit. Just kind of look at it."" Then I go a little while over it. Again, it wasn't the word or voice was there at the moment. It was just dropped out of my body like my heart sank or something. Now my heart is calmed down. And then it's just these thoughts, but they're not thoughts. They're not my thoughts. They're not my thoughts at all because I'm focusing on what-- I was trying to focus on the thing we're talking about, but it's just like someone was at the side of me, and they were talking into my ear. And I can't really understand what they were saying, but I knew what they were saying was related to what I was drawing, and it was negative, so. "
2312.0,2317.0,Interviewer,That sounds really difficult. I'm sorry.
