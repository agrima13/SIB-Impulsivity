0.0,7.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So the first question that I will ask you is, how have things been going for you lately?"
7.0,191.0,Subject,"I would say that 2021 has not been the nicest just because we came into the new year, and I was really excited that like, ""Oh, maybe things are going to [turn?]. The vaccine is going to go out, and then COVID was going to get better."" But my dad actually suffered a stroke when he went down to Kentucky at the end of January. And then he came up a week and a half or so later. And so I took care of him, essentially like a nurse for two weeks or so, so meal plans, driving, doctor's appointments, that kind of thing. And then roughly two weeks after he came back, I tested positive for COVID as did my boyfriend at the time. And then I found out that my boyfriend's father who I had literally-- we went grocery shopping the day before, so obviously, he was positive as well. And that was really rough. I think last Friday or two Fridays ago, I tested negative. Symptoms, I can't taste anything. I can't smell anything. Breathing is [eh?]. It's getting better, but it's definitely a process. And then school obviously started, of course with my luck, right around the time my dad had a stroke, so everything was just going downhill. But I have a pretty strong set of friends. I'm in a lot of extracurriculars, so that kept me going. A lot of my professors are really understanding. Midterms was rough because after I finally felt good enough, I realized that I had five midterms due in four days. So that was kind of bad. But we're past that. So now I'm just recovering and sleeping. Yeah. I think two Fridays ago, I tested negative. And then my midterms hit. And last Friday, I had three midterm essays and a test and something else due. And the three midterm essays are for one class. Yeah, I know. It doesn't really have that many assignments, so that's why the midterm is bigger. Because it's a film class,  so it's just how it is. And so having to write 35-page essays, which is nothing compared to PhD dissertation or a long lawyer kind of preparation thing, but for a sophomore in college, it's kind of rough. And so I actually didn't end up sleeping that much from Wednesday night till Friday just because you got to get it done, right? And I didn't want an extension. I know a lot of other people are going through stuff, and I felt okay enough at that point in time that I was like, ""I'm going to grind this out. I might not sleep a lot, but at least I have the weekend to recover."" So 2021 has been not the nicest, but I'm hoping it gets better because I don't know how it'd get worse from here. Yeah."
191.0,208.0,Interviewer,"Wow. That's [laughter] a lot to happen in the first two and a half months of 2021, my goodness. I'm so sorry to hear about your dad. What was it like to take care of him like that?"
208.0,210.0,Subject,I'm sorry. My dog is right next to me. [laughter]
210.0,212.0,Interviewer,"That was cute. Oh, [my goodness?]."
212.0,454.0,Subject,"Okay. Now he's in the meeting. I'm so sorry. You're sitting on my headphones. So it was really rough because I spent-- first of all, I'm only 19, and I frankly haven't had that many life-changing experiences. I've had some stuff happen to me that I think you guys already have in your file. But I haven't really had to change the way I live or had to change the way [laughter] I think because of something like an illness or something, which I would say I'm really lucky about. My mom had breast cancer, but they caught it super early. So it wasn't too big of a deal. It was stressful, but it wasn't like we had to shift-- okay, we had to shift schedules or thinking because of that. So it was really hard because I spent, essentially, any time outside of classes and extracurriculars focusing on what would be the best recovery path for my dad, making sure he took his meds and didn't overdose on any of the painkillers or anything else and called the doctors and everything. And so it was pretty rough as a whole, especially once I got COVID and kind of had to quarantine away from him. But at that point, it was kind of out of my hands because he had to take care of himself. So I have a half brother, and he is the person I go to for anything related to my dad just because my dad and I don't have the best relationship. And so once he found out that I was positive and, obviously, my dad would probably be, ""Oh, dad should take care of himself, and you should quarantine upstairs and try to stay apart. And if you have to be together, double mask and ask him to leave the main room or the kitchen or whatever."" But for the two weeks before I tested positive, I did all the grocery shopping. I had a lot of friends help out, thankfully. And obviously, Instacart is a lifesaver. And then cooking was never something I had to do, especially just because I have grandparents at home. My parents are divorced, so I used to live with my mom. And so my grandparents would always do breakfast, lunch, dinner, right? That wasn't something I had to worry about, and that was definitely a huge privilege. But then, all of a sudden, I had the burden of someone who really couldn't walk too much. He went from his bedroom to a couch in the living room, and that was most of what he did at least for the first week and a half or so. And then making breakfast, lunch, dinner, and planning the whole thing around, first of all, not cooking with salt. Because even though you can reduce your sodium intake and it's fine, it's better if you just take it out entirely. So learning to cook with spices after not cooking for 18, 19 years of my life was definitely a struggle. And just [laughter] everything hitting at once was rough because I wanted to leave a good impression for my teachers and go to office hours and talk to them and get to know my classmates. Because I'm in a smaller class, I mean, 20 to 25 people. So it's very noticeable when [laughter] someone's not there, or the teacher will point you out and call you out, like, ""Why haven't you been here?"" Thankfully, I sent an email about my dad, and I gave them an entire update, and they were really understanding, of course, until midterms came. They got a little bit antsy. But everything worked out, so. Yeah."
454.0,475.0,Interviewer,"And I'm glad they were understanding about that. That's a lot of pressure and a lot of responsibility that you had to take on. So you said that you're in very small classes. Can you tell me a little bit what that's like? I know you're taking a film class, so."
475.0,674.0,Subject,"So I'm doing four classes right now. I originally was going to do five. The fifth one was going to be a lower-credit class just to fill out the max amount I could do for the tuition I was paying, so that's, I think, 18 or 19 credits. So I decided not to do a fifth credit just because all the smaller credit classes that were still open were either way too intensive, workwise. They would be two credit classes that we're looking for, and they would have 200 pages of reading, which is ridiculous when my four credit classes only have 80 pages for a week. But I'm currently taking a management class, a film class, a World War II class, and then a liberal arts requirement kind of course, but it's the art of seduction and the Genji, which is old Japan, which is really neat. Unfortunately, obviously, I haven't been able to go to classes that much, but it is what it is. And I really enjoyed-- okay World War II is something I really enjoy as a topic. And my film class is actually in war film, so it's '45s to the '55s or so. And so it's interesting to see two classes tied together and how I can carry over elements from my World War II class to the film class and kind of apply it to discussions when I was there for discussions. And reading everything, especially filmmakers who had been in the holocaust or been involved or talked a lot about, was really interesting. And my management class is really cool because part of my concentration is management. So I'm in Gallatin at NYU, so I have the individualized study. We're called the crayon jars and the playground players. Because you have Stern, which is a huge name; CAS, which is a pretty typical name. And then you have Gallatin, which is like, ""What is everyone doing?"" Everyone's kind of forging their own path. So I'm currently on a weird track of event planning, management, finance, which is what my concentration is. How I'm going to combine it, don't ask. I have no idea. I have to write an essay about how I'm going to combine it, and I have no idea [laughter] what I'm going to write for it. So my management class has been helping me figure out management as a whole just because I'm in a lot of extracurriculars that I hold a lot of leadership positions for. So, A, I thought it would help with that kind of thing. And then, B, it would help me manage whatever else I would go into. So if I went into a company or if I led a group or something like that, it would be useful for the future. It's kind of just a life skill that I really respect and, I think, personally, a lot of leaders need more of. Yeah. Sorry about my god. [laughter]"
674.0,690.0,Interviewer,"No, that's okay. He's adorable. And yeah, so you said you're in this kind of program where you're forging your own path. What drew you to a program like that?"
690.0,722.0,Subject,"So in high school, I was never someone who's-- I'm not an academic at all. I'm not a scholar. I'm not going for a PhD. There's no way I'm doing that. And I knew that from a young age. I got really good grades at elementary school. Grades started dipping in middle, and then high school was where everything started changing. But something I had always been attracted to was volunteering and service. I had 1,600 hours of service at the end of my high school career."
722.0,723.0,Interviewer,Wow.
723.0,1201.0,Subject,"And I really prided myself in that because I'm very much a hands-on person. I like doing work, not a construction kind thing. But I like seeing things get [changed?]. I like fundraising. I like organizing events like that. And so I was involved immensely in Key Club. I also participated in 7 Cups, which is an online anonymous counseling service that's for free for people, which, I think, was a quarter of my service hours because I would do that every day for, I think, three and a half of my high school career-- years of my high school career. So I never was the kind of kid who was super into comms. I was okay at math. I really had to try hard for math if I really wanted an A. English was never my thing. My mom would not want me to pursue English anyways. But I never was [tied to?] liberal arts or STEM. I never was super passionate about women's rights or-- well, that's sounds bad. [laughter] But I'm never passionate about history as a whole. I was always passionate about World War II or certain parts of history. And so once junior year, senior year came around, I'm trying to figure out what I wanted to do while all my peers are like, ""I'll do math. Yeah, I'll do finance,"" or like, ""Yeah, I'll do economics."" I was just like, ""I don't know."" Sometimes I envy people who have a straight track because you have a course list you need to take. You find internships within that field, and you just go, right? It's a very straight, narrow track. And obviously, there's bumps, but that's just how it is. Mine is completely open. So in high school-- I knew I wanted to go close to home. So I'm northern New Jersey. Originally, I thought, ""Oh, maybe I could go six hours away from home."" Then I thought about it, and I was like, ""My mom."" And then I was like, ""Maybe I'll go four hours."" So that's what I kind of settled on. So Boston was the farthest, and there's no way I was going to a school in DC. So that was kind of canceled out. But I, at heart, am very much a suburb/city girl. So I grew up-- when I was younger, I hated New York City because it reminded me of China. Because it's gross, right? Because when you're younger, you see everything else on the floor, and you don't want to see that. But as I grew up, I took a lot more trips with my mom or my friends into the city. I really grew to love the diversity and the different kind of cultures that mash in New York City. Certainly, they clash all the time, and then you have riots and everything. But what are you going to do? NYU wasn't my first decision school even though it was my early decision school. And usually, those are the favorites. My favorite school was actually Tufts University up in Boston. Frankly, too hard for me to get in, my grades were not there. No matter how many service hours I had, my grades just would not-- and so instead I decided to pick NYU as my early decision. And still, my guidance counselor along with everyone else actually said I would never get in because NYU's GPA average was 3.7, 3.8 depending on the school. But that's usually what the average is. And my GPA was a 3.45 going in, so there's a little bit of difference. And my guidance counselor was like, ""I'm pretty sure you're just wasting your early decision spot on that school,"" which obviously was really heartbreaking, but I really believed in my passion and my drive for NYU and my love for the city to really shine through. Ironically, I never wrote anything about the city in my essay to NYU. But it's fine. At the time, senior year, I had 11 pets. So I had reptiles, lizards, turtles, fish. I got everything that didn’t have fur because my mom didn't [laughter] like [rodents?]. And then my mom didn't want to get a cat or a dog or a pig or a horse because like, ""Where are you going to put it in a suburb in New Jersey?"" So I was super into animal science education and the idea of eventually running my business or my own business and then being like a zookeeper for a little bit before starting something on my own. And that's what I wrote to NYU about. But a core idea of Gallatin that I guess they saw on my essay-- and I didn't realize because I avoided liberal arts schools, but Gallatin is one of two liberal arts schools in NYU. And I didn't realize it until orientation day in April. [laughter] So somewhere along the lines, I somehow completely skipped over the liberal arts core requirement and how liberal arts sits at the Gallatin core. But it's fine. It's fine. It's a funny story that I tell people, and they're like, ""You're an idiot."" And I'm like, ""Yeah, I agree."" So I wrote my essay a lot about studying different parts of different topics and majors, so finance and also science and education are all three separate majors. And at the core, Gallatin is a interdisciplinary school. So the way concentration [is built?] is you bring two or more majors or schools of thought together. So my three, I would have to combine somehow and then ground it in liberal arts. So I don’t know how, but I've heard of people doing studies on evil, where they've combined psychology with history, which is really cool. Honestly, any topic you give, you can probably Gallatinize it, and there's probably a major or concentration that someone's done that's similar. But I knew I wasn't a one-track person because I'm very much-- once I get interested in something, I get really interested. But getting me interested in that thing takes a while, or I need to be involved in that activity or something like that. I [inaudible] [attention?], and I don't know if I answered [laughter] your question. But yeah, I'm not a one-track person. I would never be happy just studying one thing because frankly, I think-- And my mom's driven this into me for years. To be good at a position, you should be good at other things outside of your position. So my mom took accounting classes. Obviously, she's not an accountant because she would hate doing numbers. She's like, ""I could never--"" but that accounting class has helped her in-- she works in a bank. She works in SMBC. So it helps her with money management and making sure all the files are right. She self-taught ComSci, which I'm like, ""Why would you put yourself through that pain?"" She knows Java, Python, and then some other thing. And I'm like, ""That could not be me. Good on you. You're a goddess but not me."" But she's always driver the idea of knowing more than just your singular topic, which I think is something that-- I really enjoy Gallatin even though it's really hard because I have access to, essentially, all the schools at NYU, which is also the reason why I liked it. Because you have NYU at your feet, right? And you're not just secluded to CAS or to Stern, so it's kind of nice. My idea was I get all the resources while being in school that lets me have the freedom. But yeah, that's why I like Gallatin. It's really hard trying to figure out what you're doing, but we'll get there eventually."
1201.0,1231.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, of course. And you said you're a sophomore, so you've got some time. That’s very cool that they let you kind of have that freedom right off the bat. And so you said that you have a pretty good group of friends that helped you kind of get through those really hard past few months. I'm curious where those friends are from and what those friendships are like."
1231.0,1484.0,Subject,"So the friend I see the most recently is a friend of mine who's actually been my best guy friend since sixth grade, so it's almost 10 years now. And he was actually my ex-boyfriend, my most recent one. But we broke up two weeks ago just because I thought we would be better as friends as a whole. We actually started dating at the beginning of the pandemic, so it's been a quarantine relationship, which was definitely different from the usual. But he has been one of my biggest pillars just, A, to keep me sane. B, he's involved in one of my extracurriculars, so it's nice working with him as well as, at the time, seeing him. But we still talk and hang out, so it's nice. And then I'm involved in a lot of extracurriculars. That same trend has continued into college maybe [inaudible] time commitments, but it's fine. So I'm primarily involved in three things. So one is Circle K, which is where I spend almost all of my time in terms of extracurriculars. It's the college version of Key Club. Kiwanis is our parent organization. You might know them. But I will not be the co-president soon, but I am currently the co-president. I'm the sitting international CKIx planning chair. I'm on two statewide districts and five other things [within?]. I don't need to continue. But my best friend sits on my committee just because he applied. He had a really strong application, and I accepted him. I'm not biased. I swear. And then I also do ballroom. And so I'm the treasurer within that. I was looking forward to competing in my freshman year. Obviously, in March, that didn't happen. I only got one competition before everything kind of shut down and closed. So hopefully, one day, before I graduate, we'll go back to normal. But we have, I think, three hours of lessons every week for different levels and then a weekly E-board meeting. And then my third thing that is kind of-- they're inactive right now just because it's kind of hard, but it's a cultural organization. And I was on the event planning board for them. But since it's kind of hard to plan-- we used to have like 500 people attend the events of culture mixing, and we would do a collab with the Taiwanese foundation or the Chinese global connection club. But that kind of doesn’t do anything too much anymore, but a lot of my friends come from those committees. And those are things that I'm into. So my current NYU Circle K E-board is 13 people strong. Unfortunately, some of them are inactive just because of timezone differences or something like that. But I really recognize each of my committees and each of the things that I'm in as a kind of family. Especially my own committee that I chair, I really wanted to make sure everyone could depend on everyone and really build that family relationship just because there are six other international committees, and a lot of them have lost members, which is really scary to me because I can't imagine losing one of my five committee members because I cherish them. And they're not like my children, but we're like a family, right? And so my international committee had biweekly meetings. We did weekly for January just because we had to catch up on stuff. But it's really fun to have that meeting and check in with everyone. And then once a month, we do a social just to keep the teambuilding and everything. And that's always really fun to bully each other. Not literally, I promise you. Don't report me. [laughter] But most of my friends, at least the ones I interact with now, come from there. And then I also game on the side, and I have gaming friends. So I spend all of my other free time with them. And then, obviously, there's Deakin. That's my dog. Yeah."
1484.0,1490.0,Interviewer,"Aw. Yeah. I was going to ask you. You seem so, so busy. You have so much on your plate."
1490.0,1492.0,Subject,A little bit. [laughter]
1492.0,1507.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. I was going to ask what you kind of do for yourself to unwind and stuff. I mean, you mentioned gaming, but there could also be other stuff."
1507.0,1674.0,Subject,"So there's gaming, which is a huge part of my unwinding because I just go crazy, and I just lose it. We just unwind completely, and it's really nice because school is rough, and then gaming is always a nice outlet. I got into knitting for a little bit before I lost my patience with it. [laughter] This is the third time I've tried knitting. It's not working. Someone in my E-board does crocheting. And every week, she'll show her projects. And she has a shirt made, a skirt made, a jacket made. And I'm just like, ""I can't do a stitch."" So I'm just, ""You know what? You can do it. I’m just going to sit here and watch you."" Something I've wanted to get back into is jigsaw puzzles. I am a fanatic for jigsaw puzzles. I have a ton. I've spent a lot of money on them. I have a 4,000-piece that's sitting for me. And I have two on the chair behind me that I've been wanting to do, but I just don't have the space. Also, with this big boy running around, where am I going to put it where he won't just knock it off the table? But I've been meaning to get back into that. I wanted to start working out, and then I got COVID, so that was a no-go. So I'm hoping to get back into that because I started in January of 2020. Time is a weird thing. And then, obviously, COVID hit, and I couldn’t anymore. And at that point, no motivation to work out, right,  because there's so much other stuff going on. I wanted to get back into baking, but I don't trust the oven in this house. Because I was a huge baker, especially towards the end of my high school career. My signature is Oreo cheesecakes. Yeah. And so I really enjoyed baking, but baking is, A, a lot of time commitment because that's anywhere between an hour, if you're lucky or doing something simple like cookies, to four hours to six or something. But I've always wanted to make a layered cake. And this house kind of has the room to have it. But I don't know what's going on with that oven, so I'm not going to try. I don't want to blow up on me. And obviously, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook. I don't watch TikToks. I watch Instagram Reels, but they're essentially the same thing. [laughter] Yeah. And then I read manga sometimes, and I watch anime. But I have been putting that off because I don't want to see that part of the story yet. Because I'm not ready. [laughter] Because people talk about it being a huge emotional breakdown. [laughter] I'm not ready for that."
1674.0,1676.0,Interviewer,"Oh, man."
1676.0,1680.0,Subject,"Yeah. And then, obviously, I like snacking."
1680.0,1686.0,Interviewer,"Yes, quarantine snacking is [inaudible]. What are your favorite snacks?"
1686.0,1790.0,Subject,"Okay. Something I've been going through is this. I highly recommend it, white cheddar Cheez-Its. I don't recommend the toasty ones. I bought a box thinking I would really like it. They're way too salty. And personally, white cheddar is [inaudible]. I love Goldfish Xtra Cheddar, amazing. I never got into the pizza or the birthday cake. Oh my God, Xtra Cheddar [inaudible] is perfectly fun. When I was on a diet, which I've kind of broken, [laughter] maybe, I had these fruit bars. And it's no-sugar fruit-- he likes them. [laughter] So they're no sugar. So I'll split one with him every other day or so. He's expecting half. I'm not going to eat it right now. I also, honestly, love fruits. In an Asian household, we grew up with grandparents cutting fruits. It's a sign of love, right? Because Chinese generation is like, ""You have to be strong,"" and that kind of thing. So I grew up eating fruits day and then night. I would have a plate each. So now it's different because I'm an adult, and I have to make my own fruits. And it's sad. I know. And so I'll do that every morning or night if I didn't wake up in the morning. And then I snacked on other stuff. I just can't think of it right now. Oh, I highly recommend-- not the Kirland brand but Costco carries it. It's these green rice rolls that has a little bit of brown sugar."
1790.0,1791.0,Interviewer,"Oh, I know. Yeah, the sticky rice."
1791.0,1792.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah."
1792.0,1795.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
1795.0,1798.0,Subject,"But yeah, that's my big ones right now."
1798.0,1812.0,Interviewer,"Cool. Yeah. So that's interesting. So your grandparents don't make you fruit anymore, but it sounds like you're trying to carry on some of those traditions."
