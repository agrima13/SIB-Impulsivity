0.0,3.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
3.0,50.0,Subject,"It's been going good. I'm pretty much blessed. I'm happy. My son, he's getting to eat by himself. A lot of blessings, just doing things. I have to do things like a lot of errands. I have to get [sort of?]-- I have to call some of my insurances, have to recertify. So when I get my tax I'm going to go-- I made a list of things I have to-- my goals I want to accomplish and things I want to set. Like maybe I want to go to Florida again in the summer. And also I'm happy because yesterday my boss told me that we got a raise now."
50.0,51.0,Interviewer,Awesome.
51.0,100.0,Subject,"Yeah, no. And I told him too if I could maybe work another day too, so maybe I could work four days. And then so next month, my baby's birthday. He's going to be two. And then soon I'll probably put him in daycare because since I love working, I'm going to see if I could work late a little bit of days. But to be honest, I think everything's been good to me. There's times that I'll be having a stress mood or depressed, and then sometimes I'll be happy. So I don't feel like not letting that go and trying to be happy and do good for my family, my apartment, so yeah. So I'm sort of finding things that I like so-- know what I'm going to do, what goals I'm going to set and also things to buy, like that, so."
100.0,105.0,Interviewer,Good. And you said you have some goals.
105.0,106.0,Subject,Yeah.
106.0,108.0,Interviewer,What are those goals?
108.0,172.0,Subject,"My goals, I want to decorate my house, maybe paint the rooms because I want the paint to be-- I want to paint my son's room, my room, buy some stuff, because I love Target [laughter] and Walmart. So I want to buy some stuff to decorate, like curtains, bedsheets, and stuff like that. And also I want to see maybe I can work more, but not that much sometimes because I want to be with my family too. But maybe only another day. Maybe a morning or something. And then also when my tax comes, I want to see if I could buy some stuff too and also buy off my flight, maybe two flights to go to Florida around June or something and also in October. So I'm trying to set all of that. And I also have to recertify too. But my main point is just to fix my house more, decorate it. Because it's so comfortable to have my own apartment, big and everything. And I want to paint and then buy some rugs and stuff like that. So that's my main goal, and then also vacation again. Yeah. [laughter]"
172.0,174.0,Interviewer,You just want to go to Florida.
174.0,210.0,Subject,"Yeah. I want to go probably around June or somewhere around there. I want to go again. But the main goal is I want to buy some stuff for the house. I need new bedsheets, curtains, because I cleaned my whole apartment after I had the baby, because my baby was in my mother-in-law's house. But I cleaned my whole apartment and cleaned a little bit, did this and that. And I was like, ""Well, I want to see if I could buy new bedsheets for the bed, bedsheets for the baby, maybe some rugs, decorate it."" So that's what my main goal I want to decorate more of my house, paint and stuff so it could be nice. So yeah. [laughter]"
210.0,219.0,Interviewer,You have some goals [crosstalk]. And what do you do when you go to Florida?
219.0,264.0,Subject,"I go to the beach, the pool. I usually stay in the house and then wait until my parents get home, and sometimes we go out to eat or sometimes I go out with my friends. We go to the mall, Busch Gardens, Adventure Island. We do a lot of stuff there. It's so much fun because of the weather. The last time I went there we had so much fun as well. And then my sisters just surprised me because I haven't seen my family for a long time, for maybe five years, I guess, or three years. So it was so much fun. So I can't wait this time. I want to go again. It would be nice. I want to see if I could take my son to Orlando, to Disney World. I'm not sure yet. Probably not. Maybe next year. Probably on my birthday or something. But I have so much fun there because the weather and-- so much fun."
264.0,266.0,Interviewer,And you have family in Florida?
266.0,322.0,Subject,"I have my mom, my dad, my little sister. My other sister, she lives in Texas with her husband, but they're moving to Georgia probably next year in October. And then I have some family that lives in Orlando, Miami. So everywhere. Some of my family from New York, they're trying to move over there too. So it's pretty much good. I like it here in New York because I was born here, but I was raised in Florida, so I feel like it was much easier for me. You need a car for everything, but it's much easier because of the weather and things like that. It's easy to set goals over there, and it's easy also to buy a house soon. Also, my goal is once I get my credit-- because I'm building my credit because I want to see if I could buy a house over there too as well. Probably maybe next year or two years, I want to buy a nice house over there. So I want to do that."
322.0,328.0,Interviewer,And so you have maybe moving to Florida in your future plans also.
328.0,371.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm thinking of moving to Florida because I don't want my son to go to school here in New York because there's so much pressure, and I feel like, I don't know, sometimes the kids are too much. So I feel like maybe only daycare, probably, but it'd have to be a good daycare. But to be honest, I was thinking, and I was telling my boyfriend, I was like, ""I feel like we should move to Florida maybe in two years or next year, something like that, a year."" Because I don't want him to start school here because there's too much pressure. I'd rather have him start school in Florida because it's much maybe easier for him, the weather and all that. And he would pretty much like it. So that's what I was thinking. And also, I want to buy a house there too. So slowly. That's what I want to do."
371.0,378.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And would being near your family also be an advantage to moving to Florida?
378.0,379.0,Subject,Yep.
379.0,380.0,Interviewer,Is family important to you?
380.0,403.0,Subject,"His family is too, but since I have to-- because we have an apartment here and we got benefits, but a year from now or two years, I see myself being over there and buying a house and maybe be close to my family because it's much easier, fun, and stuff like that."
403.0,411.0,Interviewer,And you said that you wouldn't want your baby to go to school here because of the pressure?
411.0,463.0,Subject,"Yeah. I wouldn't want him to go to school here not because of-- well, it is, yeah, because of the pressure, because of some of the kids are here and all that. I wouldn't want him to start school here because maybe it will be dangerous and how sometimes the teachers are. So I see news and stuff, and pretty much the pressure and probably mean kids and everything like that. I wouldn't him to because it's too much here, to be honest, for him to start school here. I'd rather have him start school in a smooth environment and smooth-- because some of the kids here, let's say if he will be four or five already, there will be too much craziness and all that, so I'd rather have him starting school in a nice, smooth place, a nice environment like that."
463.0,468.0,Interviewer,And you think that Florida will kind of be that smooth environment for him?
468.0,489.0,Subject,"Well, everywhere we go is always a bad environment, stuff like that, but I prefer it over there because you will be much-- you will be okay. So I always talk about Florida too much. I like it. I miss it. Yeah."
489.0,498.0,Interviewer,And you said that your son is about to start daycare.
498.0,537.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, not yet, but I want him to start daycare maybe next month, maybe when he turns two. I'm looking into that to see, maybe looking for childcare or a really good daycare that the days I work just only part time to see so he'll get-- because he's already eating by himself. He's already singing, talking more, and it's so cute. And I want to put him so he could learn more, interact with the teacher, interact with the kids and stuff like that, so he could be busy while we're doing our errands, stuff like that. So he could be busy playing [inaudible] with him."
537.0,542.0,Interviewer,And how do you feel about him kind of being away from you and being in school?
542.0,592.0,Subject,"Well, I would be really hurt because he really loves us so much. Today when I left, he's like, ""Mommy,"" like that. So he's too attached to us because that's really nice when you have kids that too attached to your parents. So he gets so happy when I come home. He gives me a hug and stuff like that. He plays a lot with us. He's so happy. And so probably he would be kind of saddish to put in daycare, let's say, because he's too attached to us. But then when he sees a kid and toys and stuff, probably he will be okay. Yeah. But I haven't think about it yet because I have to see because some daycares are full or just have to be waiting, so."
592.0,595.0,Interviewer,And how do you think you'll feel when he's in school?
595.0,616.0,Subject,"I would feel kind of like-- have anxiety or sad because sometimes I don't trust daycares, and who knows, maybe the teachers or stuff like that. So I will have anxiety and stuff like that. But probably I will be okay. Let's see. Yeah. We'll see."
616.0,619.0,Interviewer,So you think that you might be a little anxious?
619.0,635.0,Subject,"Yeah. Even now this day, I will be anxious too because I was like, ""If he's two, put him in daycare, how it's going to be? How the teachers will be like, the kids?"" Like that. I still get anxious this day."
635.0,638.0,Interviewer,And you said his second birthday is coming up?
638.0,639.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
639.0,641.0,Interviewer,So do you have anything planned for that?
641.0,681.0,Subject,"His birthday is next month on the 21st, so Friday. Yeah, I think it's Friday. And his aunt's birthday's the next day too. But on Friday, and I don't have any plans yet. Probably I want to take him to the new American mall in New Jersey because they have a Nickelodeon theme park. I want to take him there. Or I want to take him to maybe a little amusement park, maybe Chuck E. Cheese or somewhere maybe in Connecticut for him to play, eat a little bit, and that's it. Not that much because last year I did a birthday party for him. I want to do a birthday party this year, but just take him to a little [inaudible] or whatever, eat cake, go out to eat with him, that's it. [laughter]"
681.0,682.0,Interviewer,That would be fun.
682.0,723.0,Subject,"Yeah. Because I want it soon. I want to see if also maybe I could get just maybe two days maybe. I want to take him to the indoor water park soon. Once my tax comes through, I want to take him to a nice indoor water park like I see in New Jersey or Pennsylvania and take him there. He would love it because he loves the pool. When I took him before, he loved it. So I want to take him there because it's really fun if you want to take your toddlers out fun places and stuff. So that's what I was thinking for his birthday. Something like that. Something he could play with the kids, like that. So he'll have fun. [laughter]"
723.0,730.0,Interviewer,"Do you think that, as a parent, a lot of your activities are structured around your child?"
730.0,732.0,Subject,What do you mean?
732.0,739.0,Interviewer,Like you do more for your kid's entertainment and fun than you do yourself?
739.0,793.0,Subject,"Not really. I do both. There's times that I say I'm doing an errand and sometimes I feel like, ""Oh, I'm going to go shopping, go out to buy for the house, some food shopping."" And then there's times that I like to make activities for him, like, ""Oh, let's do this and that,"" like take him to the museum or take him to the park and stuff so he could have fun and he could be entertained because he loves to have fun. And he has good energy, and he's so happy that it's fun to take kids because they have fun and they love it too. So I like doing things as family, like kids [inaudible] and everything. I like to be like-- a lot of thing for the kids that I love to do. When I was young, I always did that. I went to Chuck E. Cheese, museums, everything. So I want to have him do that too because it's so fun because you feel like a kid yourself too. Yeah."
793.0,798.0,Interviewer,Right. So you're kind of having him directed into what you enjoyed as a kid.
798.0,844.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. And then I also buy him stuff, like little coloring book or little things for him to paint. He is so cute. He likes it. It was so much fun. I want to do a reservation for the children museum for Friday because you can get in for free because of the library card. But I canceled it, so now I have to wait till April. But the ticket's, I think, 30-something and the kids are free. The baby is free. Because it's nice because usually my sister goes to places like that in Texas with her kids. It's fun because they do little things. They could play little games. They have things you could take pictures, stuff for the kids. I would like to take him. It's nice. Yeah."
844.0,851.0,Interviewer,Do you get to spend a lot of time with your sister's family?
851.0,876.0,Subject,"No, because two of my sisters, one of them is in Florida, and then my other sister, she's in Texas. So I don't really get to see them that much, so. But my little sister, her birthday's next Tuesday. Is that right? Yeah, next Tuesday, the 21st. And [laughter] she's going to Canada the next day."
876.0,877.0,Interviewer,Oh wow.
877.0,908.0,Subject,"On Wednesday, yeah. I was like, ""What are you doing for your birthday?"" She said, ""Oh, I'm going to Canada."" By herself. And she's going to be 20. But she rented a Airbnb, something like that. And then I was like, ""Why are you not going with anybody?"" She said, ""Oh, because why would I wait to go with somebody? I want to go by myself."" Because I guess she gets to explore, and she really-- good places for her to sightsee, people who maybe she could see or maybe make friends with. So I'm happy for her, for her 20th birthday."
908.0,912.0,Interviewer,Were you guys close with your sisters when you were growing up?
912.0,921.0,Subject,"Yeah, we were really close. There was times that we argue, fight, but no, it's good. Yeah."
921.0,945.0,Interviewer,So you talked a lot about your family and kind of your own family as well. Do you think that moving to Florida is kind of-- or you wanting to move to Florida has something to do with that?
945.0,978.0,Subject,"I want to move there. To be honest, I always talk about Florida a lot, but I really miss it over there because I feel like my-- I was good. Now, with my own family, I think now, two years from now, probably I'll go buy a house over there so I could be close to my family, close to the warm weather, have my baby live good there with the weather. Because sometimes it gets colder too, but always I have to take him out and stuff like that. So it'd be really nice."
978.0,981.0,Interviewer,And what does your boyfriend think about moving to Florida?
981.0,1000.0,Subject,"I think he would like it because he went over there and he likes it. Maybe a year from now or two years, maybe I definitely know we could maybe buy a house or apartment over there, so it could be more good. Because sometimes he doesn't really like New York that much either, so."
1000.0,1004.0,Interviewer,And buying a house is something that's really important to you?
1004.0,1024.0,Subject,"I think I would buy a house or an apartment, not buy it, but-- well, buy a house probably, who knows, and maybe rent an apartment over there maybe would be nice. Let's see. So yeah, I have to force myself a lot now."
1024.0,1025.0,Interviewer,Force yourself?
1025.0,1055.0,Subject,"Yeah. Not like force myself, but push myself harder if I want this. Because sometimes you get tired of being in the same stance. And there's times that you miss where you was raised or something, that you want to go back because you feel like maybe this is not it. Or even if you have your own family, be like, ""Oh, I want to go somewhere else so my family and my son could be in a good place,"" like that. That's what I think. So yeah."
1055.0,1058.0,Interviewer,So you don't feel like New York is that good place for you?
1058.0,1081.0,Subject,"I do. Actually, I like New York and everything. But I feel like I miss being back over there because of being next to my mom and dad so I'm close to them and not [inaudible] my own son, my own family. I feel like it will be good for him there because of the weather and all that. So that's what I think. And it's not that expensive to go over there."
1081.0,1092.0,Interviewer,Right. And so you also mentioned that you got a raise and wanting to work more days.
1092.0,1240.0,Subject,"Oh yeah. Because it's a private office, actually, where I work. I work in a physical therapy. It's a private office. So last year, I got paid 12-something or 13. And now I got a raise now. Not only me though, but I think other people too because every year is-- because it's due to their policy. So I got a raise. I'm so happy. And also I told my manager, ""Maybe it's okay maybe if I could work--"" and I told my mom. She's like, ""Wow, nice."" Because me and my mom, we talk a lot. My sisters too, and my dad. And then my mom said, ""Oh, are you going to tell your manager maybe you could work another day?"" Because I work Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. So I want to see maybe I could work another day, but maybe in the mornings only. So I told him, but he has to see first, to see if I-- to see if he has another day for me to work maybe 8:00 to 2:00 so I don't have to be home late. Really nice to be home to work and stuff like that for my son, my family. So let's see. Hopefully. [laughter] Because before, I used to work six days a week, actually. And I've been there for three years now. This is my third year now. I used to work six day, Monday through Saturday. Well, Monday through Friday, and then they opened Saturday. Monday through Saturday. That's when they hired more people, and then that's when I got pregnant and I worked-- before I was pregnant, when I still had my son in my belly, I was working five or six days, I think. But then once I got pregnant, then I worked-- I was in maternity leave, and then I work again. So I've been there for a long time. And I like it because it's good. My managers are good. My manager, he's in Holland right now because his wife is from there, and she has [inaudible] and they're coming in March. But he loves working with me because me and him, we laugh, and so with that, I miss him. He's, ""I love having you,"" and everything. Hard work. Work hard and stuff. And it's nice. So it's good to work a place where you feel more-- when you feel comfortable and nice."
1240.0,1241.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's great.
1241.0,1410.0,Subject,"Yeah. There's sometimes that I get a little frustrated with my coworkers and my therapist because they always say something I don't like. Because I'm bilingual. I talk Spanish and English. And there was a patient that-- she talked English and Spanish. A little bit of English that's good. So one of my therapists, he was like-- I was helping translate, whatever. And he was telling me to tell the lady, to translate, and he was like, ""[foreign]."" So he was like-- sorry. And then he was like-- and I was helping him. And then he went to my other coworker in her front desk. He said, ""I'm wanting you to help me with the Spanish."" So right there, actually, then I was like, ""Really?"" I want to say a bad word. But he was being like that because like, ""Seriously? He doesn't think my Spanish is good?"" Because I'm bilingual, so I like to help with the patients. So I feel like he was being [inaudible] because he was saying that to my other coworker when you know I know Spanish and English. And I was trying to help you, so why are you going to tell my other coworker, ""Oh, I'm going to need your help with this,"" if I'm right there? You don't think my Spanish is good? So right there, I didn't really like it. He was like [inaudible]. So then my coworker, she was like, ""Well, I think I'm going to need to take-- I'm going to have to take Spanish lessons,"" to me and my other coworker. And I'm like, ""What do you mean? I know how to speak Spanish."" So I really didn't like that because to me, my energy was good, but then I could feel that their energy was bad, and I just hate it like that because you're the one that looked bad saying that. How are you going to have me help you and then tell my other coworker, ""Oh, I really need your help."" So then why do you have me there then? I can help. So it made me kind of mad. But overall, I kind of like what I do, my job. I don't really pay attention to that. Just sometimes I get-- because I'm sensitive, get sensitive easy. But sometimes I would feel really-- I don't really think about that. Because my boyfriend was talking about energy and also to just let it go in meditation. So I don't really think about that that much. Just a little because you know what. [laughter]"
1410.0,1416.0,Interviewer,And you said that you are someone who's kind of sensitive. What do you mean by that?
1416.0,1499.0,Subject,"Like my feeling, sometime, it gets hurt easily or sometimes I cry a lot for no reason. Or if something comes, I feel like crying. But I don't really think about that that much. I just stay focused and just move on. Because let's say maybe sometimes in the office there's some patients that are like-- because my other coworker works there more, so I usually only work now Thursdays there in the morning till 12:00, 8:00 to 12:00. And there's some patients that, ""Oh, where's that other little girl?"" She's kind of little, but she was like, ""Where's the other girl? My other aide?"" And so I feel kind of sensitive because sometimes they get used to seeing another aide there. Because I usually don't work there that much, only on Thursdays when they need me for coverage. So they say that, so usually I get sensitive because, ""What? They don't want me here or something?"" One time there was a patient that she brought [foreign] to my workers, and then I felt sensitive. Kind of feels bad because they just put it there, and she's like, ""Oh, you don't want a little bit?"" Like that. So I kind of got sensitive. I was messed up, like greedy. I already [paid?] mine. That's okay. I just come to work. So yeah."
1499.0,1505.0,Interviewer,So sometimes things happen at work that you take personally?
1505.0,1537.0,Subject,"Yeah. There's times that things happen at work, sometimes with patients. There's patients that likes me too because I treat them with kindness, with respect, and with good words and stuff. But there's sometimes that I get kind of-- feel like I take it personally, like sensitive. But sometimes I don't really pay mind to that. I just move on and stuff like that. Because you're not going to keep thinking about that too much and [laughter] just make your mind crazy. So I don't want-- so it's pretty much okay."
1537.0,1541.0,Interviewer,Is that something that you had to kind of learn to let go over the years?
1541.0,1569.0,Subject,"Yep. Because before, I used to cry a little bit because a patient said something mean to me or-- that was a long time ago. But I'm kind of-- so I'm sensitive or I'm crying. But now, because I have a kid and now stuff like that, I've been more matured and more just dealing with good energy, bad energy around people, and also meditation around people because my boyfriend told me, ""Oh, just be happy,"" and stuff like that."
1569.0,1572.0,Interviewer,So you feel like having a kid has helped with this kind of thing?
1572.0,1575.0,Subject,Yep.
1575.0,1576.0,Interviewer,In what way?
1576.0,1609.0,Subject,"Maturity, meditation, being happy, positive, blessed. Yeah. Because before, I used to be not immature, but a little bit, but I was sensitive always, like things bothered me and stuff like that, like sad. But now because I have a kid and everything, I've been more mature, and I feel like, ""Oh, I don't care about what those people said,"" like that. So yeah."
1609.0,1621.0,Interviewer,"Sorry. [laughter] So you feel like that was something you had to overcome, the like, ""I take things personally""?"
1621.0,1677.0,Subject,"Yeah. Because I think maybe before, I remember one time it was raining, whatever, and I slipped. And I hit my knee, and I was crying. And I was sensitive. I'm like, ""I don't know why I was crying for that."" But so things like that, like low self-esteem and things like that, I didn't feel confident about myself. I was always sensitive, and I was taking things personal. If somebody said this, I'd take it personal, like, ""Really? You don't like me?"" or whatever. But now I'm feeling more secure about that. I just be positive, have good energy. Because when you have good energy, then that person will have good energy too, so it will just feel okay. So I don't feel-- now I've been more matured, more just laid back. And now I don't take it personal. I'm like, ""Whatever."" Because I pretty much have my-- I'm happy. And sometimes people are weird. Yeah."
1677.0,1684.0,Interviewer,So you talked a little bit about good energy versus bad energy. What does that mean to you?
1684.0,1760.0,Subject," Well, my boyfriend knows more about that because he talks sometimes way smarter than me, but. [laughter] But bad energy is like when you're around people and you could tell that they're starting arguments or starting fights, or how they have a mean face and whatever. They have bad energy. They're ready to do something. And then good energy is they're more laid back, positive. Because you have to always have a mindset because when you're outside, you never know who you're around, if that person has good energy or that person has positive energy, good energy. So sometimes you have to be positive. So whenever you pass by people, you can just have good energy and then transfer over that to them, and they'll have good energy back to you, like that. Like me, I'm always smiley. I always have a regular face when I go out, whatever. But then I always feel like it would be positive and good when I'm outside because once you bring bad energy, then you're going to transfer it to another person. They could do damage, like that. Sorry."
1760.0,1772.0,Interviewer,And you also talked about meditation. And what is that in relation to not taking [inaudible]?
1772.0,1793.0,Subject,"Meditation is like relaxing my mind and just not thinking about it, thinking about something else good and happy, like that. Meditation, it'll just be like-- so I'll close my eyes or open my eyes and just pay it back or just think about something positive, like that, so I don't have to think about it."
1793.0,1800.0,Interviewer,So these are kind of the things that you've come up with to make sure you don't overthink some of the things that happen to you?
1800.0,1852.0,Subject,"Yep. Always. Because I overthink too much a lot, and I'm always anxious. I always feel myself, like what I'm going to do today, what I'm going to do later, what I'm going to do tomorrow.
