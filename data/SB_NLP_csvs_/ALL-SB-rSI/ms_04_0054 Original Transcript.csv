0.0,7.0,Interviewer,Okay. So the first question I'm going to be asking you is how have things been going for you lately?
7.0,128.0,Subject,"[inaudible]. It's a little bit more relaxed than usual. Especially since I [inaudible]. I also started to look more at relaxation techniques. I never realized how stressed I was until very recently. So I was able to get in some me time over the course of this couple of weeks since the Christmas holidays until now. I'm starting to discover what makes me happy and makes me relaxed, got some stuff done, started to reclaim some of the stress-relieving mood that I never had the chance to engage in, talked to some friends, did some outdoors walk just to get in touch with nature, and kind of looked at how the future might look like especially since I just got adjusted to this new way of life in school. I remember, it was only a couple months ago where I was kind of in a really bad state of agony, deciding if I wanted to quit jobs or not because of school. I won a scholarship, so I have to quit my jobs. So it was a heck of a semester trying to get used to. But I'm glad I got used to it, and I'm on my way, so that's happy. Yeah. So I'm just looking forward to what second semester brings. I'm already kind of making plans, although I know I should really slow down and let whatever life takes me will do, so."
128.0,134.0,Interviewer,That's great. So what are you doing in school?
134.0,170.0,Subject,"I am studying for a doctoral degree in psychiatric rehabilitation. So I just finished my first semester. I am also a predoctoral fellow, so I do a combination of teaching and research. I'm also going to be started some book clubs with faculty at school. So I am in the middle of trying to get my second semester up. And I'm still trying to figure out what kind of research interest I want to engage for my doctoral dissertation."
170.0,179.0,Interviewer,That sounds great. And so what do you think made you start school?
179.0,217.0,Subject,"So I've always wanted a doctoral degree. But I've been so busy, and being that my interests are so vast, I never really settled to see what it is I really wanted to do until this pandemic hit. Being you're at home all day, so you might as well think about it, so that's when I thought about it. And the program that happened to just essentially be up all in my face was the program that I applied to. That was the only program that I applied to, and I got in. It had every single interest I was ever interested in, so I thought, ""Hey, it's kind of screaming my name so might as well apply to it."" And I got in, so."
217.0,224.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And what do you think drew you to this particular program, in the end?"
224.0,255.0,Subject,"I think it's really my line of experiences working in the psychiatric rehab field. It's pretty vast, from direct work to policy making to creating programs, so I think this program kind of embodies that very, very much, and it had a lot of wiggle room. So being that I also had a lot of certifications that was created by the [Safe?] Program, I thought, ""Why not? This is kind of right up my ally."""
255.0,269.0,Interviewer,"That's great. And I'm curious. What's it like to be in a program after, it sounds like, working a lot? And it sounds like a big transition. So what has that been like for you?"
269.0,321.0,Subject,"I remember being kind of sad, kind of you went from a really high, sky, parachute, and you kind of got dropped all the way onto the floor. And it's like, ""Oh, this was kind of different. What's going on here?"" Mostly because it's a different way of life. You're not engaging with clients 24/7. I really liked that 24/7 interaction with people. And on top of that, I had a much bigger income. Right now, I still get income but not as big. But people just reassure me, ""Hey, you're working for something even bigger and better."" So yeah, I mean, if I were to compare it to an analogy, it's almost like you dropped out of a dropped, and you landed on the floor. Safe and sound, yes, but it's kind of different like, ""What happened?"" [laughter]"
321.0,333.0,Interviewer,"It's still a lot to go through, yeah. So what was your kind of old job like that you were doing so much patient interaction with?"
333.0,372.0,Subject,"So I was a direct support worker for PEAK with kids and families with disabilities. So I was in charge of-- essentially did counseling and mentoring and helping them to gain skills for effective living. I think with the pandemic that hit, I also became a research navigator, which is kind of like a-- which is kind of like a contact tracer, only I specialize in the resource part. So I did a lot of helping them to get from point A to point B, rehabilitation-related work, that type of stuff."
372.0,394.0,Interviewer,"Very cool. And it sounds like there was some hard times during that time, and you were saying that you have been employee some relaxing techniques and stuff. So what was it like when it was really difficult?"
394.0,530.0,Subject,"So I have to say, I'm very fortunate enough to have a couple of friends, a handful of friends, that I consider who are close. We follow each other to vent whenever times get hard. One of them happens to be a colleague of mine in this program right now. We just call each other whenever we need to vent. There's actually three of us. One of them happens to be someone I talk to more because, well, we share a lot more in common. And I think when we vent our struggles, and we look at the fact that we're not alone. We're on the same boat. It helps. And at the same time, I have other friends too, who kind of call me to cheer me on. It's like, ""You made it this far. This is what you wanted. I don't know why you're kind of down right now. I don't get it."" And I'm like, ""It's not that I don't it. It's more like, it's such a big job."" And I was talking to one of my colleagues, and she knew my situation. And she's like, ""Wow. That's a big job. I mean, how do you handle that?"" I was like, ""I don't even know. I'm just kind of like every day is whatever comes, just keep going."" And I recognize it was a huge learning curve for me. Not because the work was hard, because there was so much involved. And I think a lot of it was because the pandemic made a lot of stuff harder. People weren't necessarily operating as quickly as we ought to think they can. And it's understandable, and at the same time, it's like I didn't really know what was going on. And on top of that, the thought that I had to drop from-- essentially, I had a pretty big salary to live on. I was free. And all of the sudden, they're like, ""You can't have any of that because you are essentially dedicated to this now."" So I had to quit all that. And all of sudden, it went from like a [25,000?] aerial view to like you're now on ground zero trying to see what's going on. Again, it's not something I can't manage. It's just it's very different now. Every day you woke up knowing that somebody needed your help, and you were going to answer that phone call when somebody needed you. But now it's you're teaching, and you're doing research. It's not that much interaction, and the dynamic is different. So it just presents a lot of changes."
530.0,547.0,Interviewer,It sounds like you really like the interaction part of the work. And what about that do you think is so special to you?
547.0,585.0,Subject,"I think it helps me to gain a sense of satisfaction that I made a difference in someone's life and that I was able to kind of change somebody for the better or change the circumstances for them. But at the same time, I'm able to kind of use whatever I know works for them to help them get from point A to B. So it's kind of that ah-ha moment where it builds up and builds up, and you see that something worked. That's kind of what makes it all worth it."
585.0,604.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I can imagine. It's really powerful to experience. So you're doing this degree, and it sounds very exciting. What are you interested in doing after you finish?"
604.0,637.0,Subject,"My ultimate aim is to go into academia, do some research related to empowerment, rehabilitation, and programs and policies, integrating in some type of cultural awareness to it. But I know in order to get to that, I'm going to have to do some postdoctoral work, which I know this is like three years down the line, but I'm already thinking about it, so. "
637.0,652.0,Interviewer,"Better to plan, then to be a surprised, I guess. That's great. So what about empowerment do you think is so important to kind of emphasize in policy?"
652.0,691.0,Subject,"I think it's important to look at the opticals that got us here in the first place. Looking at the factors involved on the wider scale, the systemic issues, trying to harness support, and I guess trying to round up a sense of consensus in order to come up to some type of solidified plan to battle it because I think right now the main issue is that there is no [sense of community?]. So all this is kind of like a symptom of that, so."
691.0,698.0,Interviewer,"And when you say, ""All of this,"" what exactly are you describing?"
698.0,713.0,Subject,"All the chaos, all the unrest, the inequality, I guess, the agony, the anxiety."
713.0,725.0,Interviewer,"So if I'm getting this correctly, you're interested in kind of where psychiatry or mental health might meet policy and politics. Is that right? Yeah. "
725.0,726.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
726.0,738.0,Interviewer,What do you think kind of drew you to this field of study and connecting those two things? It sounds like you're very passionate.
738.0,850.0,Subject,"So I think, growing up as an Asian American woman, I've always witnessed some type of, I guess, unequal footing somewhere here or there. And being that I had to essentially learn an entire language because English is not my first language, I kind of understood what it meant to not exactly have a lot of resources. And understanding the cultural dynamic in the sense of while working hard and trying to make it in a world that isn't necessarily equipped to handle diversity sometimes, it helped me to witness what depression really meant. And so I am just naturally-- I love going out into community. I've worked a lot with different types of experiences including with elected representatives and with just tutoring youth and a wide variety of other stuff throughout the city of New York. I just realized that community work is what I'm passionate about. And at the same time, I saw that there was a common element involved of psychiatric ailments. A lot of it, all these social issues really have a common denominator with psychiatric concerns. And so that's when I started looking at how social issues can be solved. But you can't really solve them without looking at the psychiatric rehab component and empowerment. So that's how I came to this field."
850.0,877.0,Interviewer,That's incredible. I'm really interested in how your upbringing and kind of some of the struggles that you had led you to this. So what was it like to have to learn English and really kind of struggle with that and be put in that position?
877.0,981.0,Subject,"So being that I had a family that didn't really know English, a lot of what I had to do was just repeat what other people were saying. That's how I learned it and knowing that I wasn't going to have a natural resource at my disposal to learn English. A lot of it came from just this theory where the second-hand learning [inaudible] hard work, wherever you want to just pick up some words or learn some words on your own time and try to talk as much as you can, taking ESL classes. I mean, I have to say that it would have been nice if I had someone at my disposable to help me with that. But I knew that wasn't going to happen, so I kind of just rely on whatever I can to be able to make sense of the world around me. So I remember in Kindergarten when a teacher used to say something to me, I didn't understand what she was saying, but I knew to look for context clues. And it's like, ""Oh, you want me to go there. Okay. Thank you."" Right? And I remember in first grade, I kind of knew the English language then, but there were some words here or there that I didn't necessarily understand, but I could understand from the other words, ""Oh, you want me to sit down."" Right? So those were the types of things that helped me to get by. But I think just not being able to benefit from having English as my first language, it gave me the habit of learning other skills and other learning techniques that helped me to get along in this world."
981.0,998.0,Interviewer,That sounds like it must have been difficult even if it sounds like you learned a lot of really important skills from it. So what languages did you grow up speaking at home?
998.0,999.0,Subject,Mandarin.
999.0,1013.0,Interviewer,Very cool. And so what has it been like to have parents that you speak entirely in one language to and a lot of the rest of your world be in English?
1013.0,1051.0,Subject,"It's just like a two-world thing. You're always trying to make sense of it. And then it kind of starts shedding light as to who you are in terms of identity. You are kind of in the middle of two worlds. Here, you have one set of your own heritage, and then here, you're learning something entirely new. You find something in common when you see someone who looks like you. But then you go somewhere else, and you wonder, ""Well, this kind of part of your world, isn't it, so how do you mesh the two?"" so."
1051.0,1065.0,Interviewer,"And do you think that you've been able to do that pretty easily, or is it still something that is hard to do today?"
1065.0,1183.0,Subject,"At first, it was kind of a struggle. I mean, it's still something that I battle. But I think the difference now is that I've learned to embrace it. So every time I face any concerns along those areas, instead of just kind of voicing my complaints, I just kind of embrace it like, ""I'm here. This is what I represent. I'm both Chinese, and I'm also an American."" And I take in the things that are before me. I integrate them into who I am. So I'm a Chinese American, but I'm also someone who embraces ideologies that are external to the identity. So that's one of the things that helped me develop a love for culture and racial talk, simply because I know where my position is as it relates to that, right, because as somebody who belongs to a gender minority and also a cultural minority, it helps me to develop a type of empathy that, I guess, some others wouldn't necessarily be able to pick up on. It's just the sort of direction that I have in life, that I'm able to see things through that lens and to be able to relate to people in a certain way. So right now I just jump on every opportunity to say, ""Oh, yeah, there's something to be done here. There's somebody who needs resources. Oh, I could definitely try to help them."" That's why certain things like the pandemic hit, being a resource navigator was really something I loved doing because pointing people to resources was just something I naturally did as part of who I was, so."
1183.0,1221.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And gosh, a lot of people need it right now. So that's really cool that it's been able to kind of help you in your work a little bit to have navigated all this yourself. I'm curious. Can you tell me about an example of some time when it really did help you kind of empathize with someone, and you were able to kind of really relate to something that was going on in their life?"
1221.0,1306.0,Subject,"A time when I was able to relate to somebody using empathy was actually when somebody told me that their parents-- somebody who actually had a mom who had COVID-19. So this individual was a Hispanic, so I didn't necessarily have the language affinity with. But I did identify with them in the sense that I had parents at one point who didn't understand English either. And I remember having to fend for myself, so. And she was very, very much feeling helpless because, well, I think this was a minor, and she didn't know what to do without her mom. And her mom was in the hospital, and the only people she had around was her father and her brother, and they were not necessarily people she went to all the time. Her mom was her direct source of support. So essentially, I just kind of-- all I could do was just comfort her and ask her to develop some sort of coping strategy, and that's what I was there to help her with. But I think definitely understanding what it's like to have parents who don't know the English language and how scary it can be, what kind of challenges that presents, and how that impacts just experience overall, can really be daunting."
1306.0,1350.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Of course. And also, the ways of navigating health and mental health are so different in different communities, that that's also something beyond the language that can be difficult to navigate. So it sounds like you're really invested and kind of successful at what you're doing. At the beginning of the call, we were talking about kind of coping mechanisms. I'm curious about some of your relaxation techniques and things that you do for yourself during this time."
1350.0,1391.0,Subject,"So I've been trying to develop ways of relaxing muscles. I mean, I've come to realize very recently that I think much of my stress is not necessarily-- I mean, it is emotional. It is mental. But I think a lot of that manifests itself as muscle stress. So I've been trying to figure out ways to relax that. I think a lot of it just really involves me relearning what the definition of relax and stress relief means because I used to think, ""Well, if I could just go outside and still be productive, that would be great."" But you can't really relax and try to be productive, so."
1391.0,1407.0,Interviewer,"Fair enough. And it sounds like you have a great support system, a great kind of group of friends you were talking about earlier. And you said a couple of them were in your program?"
1407.0,1408.0,Subject,Yeah.
1408.0,1417.0,Interviewer,So what is it like to kind of work with someone and be their friend as well?
1417.0,1451.0,Subject,"I mean, it's a more stable sense of mutual support. And I think the only reason why she and I have a very solid type of friendship is because we have a lot of the same identity kind of sort of. We both had jobs that we gave up. We both identify with a certain faith. We both have goals and dreams and all that stuff. And I think she and I share a lot of the same values, so we just kind of clicked right there."
1451.0,1478.0,Interviewer,"That's great. And in terms of the rest of your program, have you been liking the people there beyond your friends? How has had it been to kind of-- you said it's such a big transition. I'm curious. Is it also like a social transition, or are you feeling it more in terms of being back at school rather than working?"
1478.0,1644.0,Subject,"It's a bigger transition because, well, I don't know. I guess it's just being tasked a lot more stuff, a lot higher of an expectation. And I think for the first time in my life-- I don't know if you heard the term imposter syndrome. For the first time in my life, I was like, ""I feel like an imposter. Is everything I do good enough? What's going on?"" Right? You do get feedback but not as often as you like. And before, it was just you help somebody. You see that ah-ha moment. You write it down in a progress note, and you're kind of done. But now it's like as much as they value you as part of a team, you always wonder if this is good enough, right? Research is just never something that's ending because you're always on the hunt for something. It's also the sense of it's a big, big university. And I don't know if you heard of this saying. Somebody sent this to me that kind of sums up what I'm feeling. It's, ""You were once a big fish in a small pond, but now you're a small fish in a big pond."" So now that I completed a semester, I guess, it's safe to say that I went from a small fish in a big pond to a medium fish in a big pond, which I guess is logical, and it makes sense. So I'm kind of feeling better now because I grew in size, and I have more at my disposal to use. But I think it's really just maybe you could call it a shock. Again, I used to talk about it like, oh, it's such a horrible thing. But I think it's just shock. It's not a bad thing. It's just shock. Because I got into a program that I never thought I would. And then on top of that, I got a scholarship, a full-tuition scholarship along with a stipend. As much as all that's great and dandy, there's was one thing I had to give up, which was my job and all this other stuff. And getting all that kind of meant giving up some type of control too, which I really didn't like. So it was a whole lot of changes, and it was also getting to know people and being able to come up with something last minute that sounded in any way even logical, presenting to people that was going to be very critiquing of your work, and being able to take on just doctoral-level work all at the last minute. It was a very big quick change because all this was announced to me right at the beginning of September, and I had to give in notice to my program, my jobs that I had to quit. And it was such a very unexpected last-minute change that I didn't have much time to process."
1644.0,1661.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That sounds like a really quick kind of transition. And it sounds like it was kind of disappointing to have to leave your job. What was that like?
1661.0,1753.0,Subject,"I battled it very much because I had a really tight-knit relationship with my coworkers. I still talk to them, and I tell them all the time that I miss them like hell, and don't ever underestimate the importance or power of a good coworker team. But we keep talking about reunion, and that if it weren't for COVID, we'd probably be hitting a restaurant right now and eating and talking. And we still laugh and joke around. But it's hard because I didn't want to leave the people. At the same time every day when I woke up, it something to look forward to that have somebody calls me going, ""I really need help."" And being to instill that sense of hope and walk along with them and not leaving them alone and being able to say, ""You know what? I helped somebody get up even after a really bad life defeat."" So having to move on from that with only, what, I think it might have even been, what, a week worths of time to think about it. And I remember even trying to bargain and say, ""Hey, how about I only do this, and the rest of the time I'll do your work?"" And they wouldn't even take that. So the sort of thing where I had to really battle, and I only had a week's worth of time to be able to process that and say, ""All right. I'll do this."" But deep inside, I'm like, ""I can't believe something was taken away from me,"" so yeah."
1753.0,1784.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean, that seems unfair. But so I mean, curious. It sounds like you really were so engaged in this patient-facing-- or at least people-facing environment, and now you're doing something kind of more academic, and there's more policy. How do you see yourself-- well, do you see yourself going back to doing more patient-facing work?"
