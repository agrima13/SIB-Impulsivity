1.0,6.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So the first question I have for you is just how have things been going for you, lately?"
6.0,113.0,Subject,"Things have been going pretty good. I mean, school's been going great. And I was a little nervous about it at first because it was some subjects that I might not have known or had a little uncomfortable with. I mean, for my science, I am taking it as a pass-fail because after my first encounter with sciences, it was pretty tough. So I [provide?] a failsafe. But I'm doing really well in it and getting a lot of high 90s, almost 100s. And also, with different anthropology classes and a media class, it's been interesting to learn what techniques I could use to enhance my film making. And I've been using Premier and some other film equipment. And it's been very interesting. Two of my teachers I've known since freshman and junior year. And it's been fun to get to work with them again. And they're always happy with working with me, too. And let's see. And life is going good so far. I'm living upstate. Right now, it's a bit of a huge adjustment to live here long time when I've been basically using this house as a vacation home. But I have definitely gotten used to living here."
113.0,119.0,Interviewer,That's good. So are you interested in film making?
119.0,193.0,Subject,"Yeah. I've been doing film since high school of my education. Though I had a rough experience with a teacher that I prefer not to get into, but yeah, he almost made me want to not do anything with film. But I still didn't give up and managed to pursue more of my interest. And thus, I ended up getting into one of the hardest cinema schools to get into at USC. So it's been a big achievement. And I like movies and all of that. There's two movies I've watched nonstop until the cassette tapes were all stopped working, and it was Jim Carrey's How The Grinch Stole Christmas and Rugrats In Paris, which I did have fond memories of. And yeah, my tastes have widened to more comedies, more action, and all that. And the subjects been very interesting to me."
193.0,201.0,Interviewer,That's great. What do you think drew you to do film yourself?
201.0,270.0,Subject,"I had an interesting concept of using my toys to reenact certain events and pantheons, and it's been interesting to try to media [them out?] for myself. And getting into that, as well as anthropology, I found through the Margaret Mead Film Festival in Museum of Natural History in New York, and that was super interesting to see so many cool films of different cultures that have not been explored yet. And it really came to me when I went to the American Anthropological Association where I saw different professors and people presenting their topics, and that was super interesting. And it also got me to do some papers for that program, which I've presented three times. One in Denver, the other in Washington, and one in San Jose. And it's been a really great experience for me."
270.0,273.0,Interviewer,What was that paper on?
273.0,320.0,Subject,"My first paper was on cosplay as a tribal ritual. So I explored cosplay and the connections to the heroes journey and [intros?]. And the other one was transgender youth and how they're being exposed on social media. And my third and latest one was on hikikomori in Japan and how it's connected to anime-manga in a way. And that actually was like a-- at a writers' conference back at school, I got honorable mention for that paper. So it went from an assignment for a [inaudible] trip in Japan to an anthropological presentation to an honorable mention winner at a writers' competition."
320.0,322.75,Interviewer,Wow. That's so cool. 
322.75,323.0,Subject,Thank you.
323.0,325.0,Interviewer,Congratulations.
325.0,329.0,Subject,Thanks. I really am proud of that achievement.
329.0,344.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, you should be. That sounds like such a kind of diverse publication list. I'm curious what kind of got you interested in all of these topics."
344.0,421.0,Subject,"Well, I'm a huge fan of anime, and I was very interested in wanting to explore more about it. And there's a lot of shows that have some interesting values and things that gather a lot of people together. And as for transgender, it was like a-- it was like a project that I was working on. And I think it was interesting to figure out statistics of it. And for hikikomori, it was a subject-- it was one of the subjects that I found in readings that was interesting for my class, and I decided to go with that topic with exploring some connections of anime-manga that explored topics of hikikomori. Yeah, most of it was just interests and interesting facts. How to explain the motivation of it."
421.0,429.0,Interviewer,And so I've heard you mention anthropology a few times. Is that something you're studying in school?
429.0,447.0,Subject,"Yes. It's one of my majors at school. I'm doing a [inaudible] practice, which is one of the divisions in film and anthropology, which is like-- and visual anthropology, which is one of my big majors."
447.0,451.0,Interviewer,"So what is visual anthropology, specifically?"
451.0,486.0,Subject,"Visual anthropology is basically like anthropology captured on screen. And with that, you make-- and with that, it's basically what captures certain tribes or different people on camera. And you're studying it visually. Unlike written text or other writings."
486.0,497.0,Interviewer,Gotcha. And so what about visual anthropology is of particular importance or significance to you?
497.0,547.0,Subject,"Well, with visual anthropology, it's interesting to see so many different styles of shooting and different perspectives that you see. You get this new sense of discovery when looking at different-- when looking at different cultures on screen. And it makes you feel like you're there. And sometimes it's like you view it from the filmmaker's perspective, but other times, the subjects of the film really get to speak for themselves. And it's real interesting to me."
547.0,567.0,Interviewer,That sounds really interesting. What do you think is kind of a good example of that difference of sometimes having the perspective of the filmmaker and sometimes having people kind of speak for themselves?
567.0,623.0,Subject,"Well, there's two modes of this. There's the fly in the wall and the fly in the soup. Fly in the wall is you're just an observer. For instance, there may be a certain culture and anthropologist just takes you through or just narrates what's happening in events. Like what Margaret Mead was doing in certain films, like bathing babies. I can't remember the name of it, but there was just one film where she was recording a trance. And then, there's other films, which actually take you through the subject's point of view, and filmmakers actually in [inaudible], they're actively participating or interviewing with the subjects [inaudible]."
623.0,626.0,Interviewer,Which one do you prefer?
626.0,656.0,Subject,"I like to hear what-- I definitely like to hear the small voices speaking for themselves. I'm very fascinated by small voices, and I feel that I'm a big listener in hearing voices that are overshadowed by big perspectives. Yeah, the small voice always attracts me."
656.0,662.0,Interviewer,"What is it like to be a listener of the small voice, as you put it?"
662.0,694.0,Subject,"Well, it's very [fascinating?]. And to be a listener, you actually can hear what other people can't. And it gives you more of an insight to it rather than just hearing one simple narration of what they think. When you listen closely, you get an idea of what these people are like and how they function for yourself. "
694.0,698.0,Interviewer,And what makes that important?
698.0,737.0,Subject,"What makes it important is that you get a sense of what they're talking about. And it's important to notice different aspects that you may not have discovered before when you're listening to, excuse me, when you're listening to someone else. Yeah, it definitely provides more of a new perspective or something fantastic."
737.0,757.0,Interviewer,"Interesting. And so I'm getting a good sense of some of your work that you do at school or for school. You said that it was kind of a transition to live where you're living upstate. I'm curious, how has that transition been?"
757.0,854.0,Subject,"Well, when COVID happened, it's been an interesting couple months. Because when it happened, I was still in school back in LA. I was living by myself. And I was used to living by myself for three years, or three-and-a-half years, because I've been doing so well on my own since I've learned a lot. But since COVID happened, I ended up going back to my apartment. But then, we decided to move upstate permanently until this would all blow over. So we had to repack and remove everything from the house that's been around for a long time. Because I've been living there since the end of high school. And to see it all go upstate, in a way, it's been really crazy. We've all been trying to adjust to this new way of living. But I mean, I have my own room, now, and so do my two parents. And it's been an easy transition. Well, it hasn't been super easy since we had to move everything, but we've been getting used to it, and it's been doable. So yeah."
854.0,861.0,Interviewer,"And so you have your own room, but how was it to be living with people again after living alone?"
861.0,918.0,Subject,"It's been good. I mean, we definitely know each other by now. And living with my parents, we know what our situations are and all of that. But yeah, I mean, I've been living alone with a roommate back in college, but a few of them were total strangers. I mean, one of them was my friend. Let's see. But no, I definitely know these two for a long time. So it hasn't been too [drawing?] for me."
918.0,928.0,Interviewer,"That's great. And how has it been to kind of be away from school for the first time, doing virtual learning?"
928.0,987.0,Subject,"Well, I like the new change of pace of working at home. Because for classroom assignments, you get more time, and for tests, it's more open book, something you can't get when you're at school. But I miss the feeling of going on campus or walking around campus and going to classes. I mean, that's all part of the college experience, and I miss seeing people actually face-to-face rather than onscreen. And in some of my classes, some people don't even show their face cam onscreen, just their profile. But yeah, I've missed some aspects of the campus life like doing a lot of social activities, and all that, and events. But no, I've gotten used to home learning by now."
987.0,994.0,Interviewer,"[inaudible]. What kind of activities and events are you kind of missing out on, now?"
994.0,1086.0,Subject,"I'm missing out on group talks, free lunch or dinner events where they actually give out free food. I've been missing that in person. And there are two clubs that I go to, an anime club and a meditation club where in person we get to explore our passions and interests. But since a lot of schools been going on and since there's so much work to do, it's kind of hard to get back into those two things because of the different time zones here. Because 7:30 or 5:30 for them would be like an 8 o'clock, or a 10:00 for me, or 11:00. And it's been tough to keep with it. But I'm getting used to the contrasting hours. But it feels like my morning class is like an afternoon class and my late afternoon class is like a night class. And yeah, it's been strange. So I guess, I miss that being able to conduct everything at the same time, basically."
1086.0,1094.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. What is it like to not be able to go to your meditation?"
1094.0,1128.0,Subject,"Well, I'm still doing all right, but not being able to go to it, it is kind of tough because it's been helping me out come down either after classes or before exams. But yeah, it's been a little bit tough without it. But still, I'm managing to do well on my own."
1128.0,1135.0,Interviewer,Great. What about meditation are you drawn to?
1135.0,1177.0,Subject,"Well, I'm drawn to being-- I definitely think it's an easy process to use when you're feeling stressed. And it's been helping me a lot. And I definitely enjoyed the thought of it. And sometimes even the commodity of [some?] people. And it's been real helpful for me in terms of because I have a lot of anxiety, so it definitely helps me calm-- it calms me down, basically. It's definitely a great way to reduce stress."
1177.0,1185.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, for sure. What kinds of things do you get stressed about the most?"
1185.0,1225.0,Subject,"Well, it's a lot of things. There's social situations like meeting new people or going to new events, and then there's school assignments and tests would stress me out, and some living situations. Like whenever there's something new, or imposing, or something that's very challenging coming up, I get stressed out about that. Well, like getting results for something, it's very stressful."
1225.0,1230.0,Interviewer,And what is that like? What does it feel like?
1230.0,1250.0,Subject,"It's pretty scary. You're short on breath, and you have anxiety. It's like you have trouble getting the words out properly. And it's very stressful. Yeah."
1250.0,1252.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that sounds difficult. I'm sorry."
1252.0,1256.0,Subject,That's okay. 
1256.0,1259.0,Interviewer,"Hopefully, the meditation is still helping, though."
1259.0,1261.0,Subject,Yeah.
1261.0,1273.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what kinds of things are you able to try to do for fun now that you're not really on campus?
1273.0,1340.0,Subject,"Well, I feel like now I can spend a lot more time with my family, now. And sometimes they have movie and TV nights, which I haven't been able to do out of campus because it's been a while. And I feel like we can talk more, and see some specials, and all that. And yeah, although before this all happened, I would hang out with friends on weekends at their place, play games, watching movies or shows. But during COVID, it's been kind of hard to get together with them due to our busy schedules. So I guess, to answer it, it would be I'm spending a lot more time with my family, now."
1340.0,1343.0,Interviewer,"Are you close with your family, in general?"
1343.0,1376.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. For sure. I mean, I guess, maybe a little too close. But still, I think that's where all the love comes in. Especially my mom, we're super close, and we're like a team. She helps me out with my work sometimes, and it's super helpful. And it helps get points across and certain explanations that I would not be able to see if I was by myself."
1376.0,1393.0,Interviewer,"That's great. That's so sweet. And it sounds like-- correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're coming to maybe the end of your time in LA or at school. Are you a senior?"
1393.0,1415.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, I basically finished my program. But I'm almost done with my GEs in anthropology, so I'm close to a degree. And I'm in the progressive master's program, so I'm working on a thesis for the MBA."
1415.0,1418.0,Interviewer,"Oh, cool. At the same time?"
1418.0,1428.0,Subject,"Yeah, at the same time. I mean, I just got a few GEs, and I'm taking two classes from the progressive MBA. "
1428.0,1438.0,Interviewer,Very cool. And what do you think are kind of the next steps in your future after you have this degree?
1438.0,1482.0,Subject,"Well, I'm hoping to find a job somewhere in a museum. I mean, my first work study was cataloging for an archive in the ethnography department at the LA museum-- at the LA county museum. And I'm hoping to do work similar to that or actually dabble in curation, which is something I'm into. So hopefully, around those aspects to be in museum work or archiving."
1482.0,1491.0,Interviewer,Do you think you'll be able to incorporate any of the kind of film stuff you've been doing when you do those things?
1491.0,1525.0,Subject,"I think it will help give me a background of what to do. And I'm interested in one aspect of filming, which is editing. Again, something I have done since high school and got a certificate for. And with that, I don't know, I guess, hoping to apply some knowledge that I learned from films into some of my career."
1525.0,1529.0,Interviewer,What kind of things do you think you could apply?
1529.0,1563.0,Subject,"I guess, some things that I could apply are different techniques, [inaudible], editing, I guess, a little lighting. But still, it would help if I understood the terminology, and then as a position like a director or an IDM man, I'd definitely know what I'm asking for."
1563.0,1566.0,Interviewer,What does a director or an IDM man do?
1566.0,1600.0,Subject,"Well, they basically are the heads of projects, and they help direct the staff in having it. And with an IDM, they pitch some ideas out, and they determine what's best for the project they're working towards. I don't know. It's very complicated to explain, but I just had a little gist of it."
1600.0,1606.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that was helpful. So is that something you're interested in?"
1606.0,1622.0,Subject,"Partially, yeah. I definitely enjoy being part of the people behind the ideas. Because that's always something that's interested me. "
1622.0,1625.0,Interviewer,What do you think makes that so interesting?
1625.0,1643.0,Subject,"I think for the fact that you get to dabble in so many different subjects, and you can determine what you want to work on. And I don't know, a lot of inspiration and thought goes into it."
1643.0,1647.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, it seems like a very creative process, for sure."
1647.0,1650.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely."
1650.0,1659.0,Interviewer,"[inaudible], so that is-- do you think you'll be in LA? Where do you want to be when you try to--?"
1659.0,1716.0,Subject,"A lot of places. I'd like to be either in LA, Washington, Boston, San Francisco. There's a lot of places in mind where I could go. Because I heard with-- so yeah, it depends on wherever I go or wherever the journey leads me whether I'll stay in [UC?] or move onto a grad school, hopefully, one that doesn't take the GREs, like Stanford. And again, it was kind of surprising to me. That's why I'm thinking-- and that's why I'm kind of thinking of San Francisco, as well. I mean, Washington, DC, for all the museums around there, like the Smithsonian and the National Geographic Museum. And Boston because I've been there so many times, and it's a fun place."
1716.0,1722.0,Interviewer,That's cool. And what might you want to do in graduate school if you go?
1722.0,1745.0,Subject,"Well, I think somewhere in anthropology, but I'm still not sure of what I want to do exactly. Because it's still a big process, and I'm still learning. And yet, it all depends on where I want to go with my journey, you know?"
1745.0,1756.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And how do you think-- how do you think you'll figure that out, the next parts of your journey?"
1756.0,1770.0,Subject,"Well, I think it's all through trial and error whether I enjoyed this experience or not, it'll determine what I want to do."
1770.0,1783.0,Interviewer,Fair enough. Cool. Is there anything that I didn't think to ask you that you think is important to share about yourself?
1783.0,1794.0,Subject,"Sorry, I'm still trying to think."
1794.0,1797.0,Interviewer,That's okay. Go ahead.
1797.0,1848.0,Subject,"Well, I guess, a few things about myself are that, well, as you already know, I'm from New York, and I went to school in California. And my hobbies are doing film and also watching animations and entertainment. And I very much enjoy movies and television. Let's see. And yeah, that's basically around the whole gist of who I am."
