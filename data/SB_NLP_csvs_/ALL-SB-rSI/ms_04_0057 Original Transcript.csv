0.0,5.0,Interviewer,So the first question that I have for you is just how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,24.0,Subject,"I think things are going well. Yeah. I think things are going well. School is finished. Now it's just winter break. So yeah, I think things are going well."
24.0,29.0,Interviewer,And so what have you been up to over winter break?
29.0,72.0,Subject,"I think I'm going to just focus on-- I have a bunch of things I need to-- I kind of made a list of things I need to sort of accomplish. I just need to tackle each one day by day. One of them is internships. I'm also trying to fix-- sorry. I'm also trying to fix my garage. So my parents gave me the garage, so I'm trying to just fix that and kind of make it into my own personal space. Other than that, I think winter break will be good."
72.0,80.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what do you think is important about having your own space in the garage?
80.0,117.0,Subject,"I mean, I think it gives me some sense of freedom, I guess. But also, it's more roomy than my room upstairs. So I don't know. I guess the only bad thing is that there's-- I need to get a really-- I need to invest in a really good heater because it's not really insulated. And so it's getting really cold outside, so."
117.0,124.0,Interviewer,That's cool. So what kind of things do you think you'll do in there?
124.0,155.0,Subject,"I think I'll probably bring my friends over or something, and we'll just hang out there. Or I'll just go downstairs if I want some distance from my family. Just because, I don't know, it can be really loud sometimes, and I can't really focus on certain things. So going downstairs will definitely help with that, I think."
155.0,162.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what kinds of things do you think you need to really focus on right now?
162.0,201.0,Subject,"Right now? I think I'm just going to focus on, majority, just myself and sort of improving myself. I don't know. I want to be better than I was, I guess, like a month ago. So I want to just, I don't know, improve different aspects of my life as well. I don't know. Yeah. Sorry. That's my dog. Can I just let him in real quick?"
215.0,217.0,Interviewer,"Oh, sweet."
217.0,218.0,Subject,Yeah.
218.0,224.0,Interviewer,Okay. So talk to me about what was going on a month ago.
224.0,328.0,Subject,"A month ago? A month ago, I was [inaudible] classes. And I think this semester just-- it's been a weird year. This whole year's been really weird. But definitely this semester and last semester-- I don't know. I think the summer kind of ruined this semester as well just because-- I don't know. So basically, my parents went to a trip, like March, I think. Starting in March, my parents and my sister. And it was supposed to last for three days, but then there was a shutdown because of COVID. That was before COVID though. So there's been a shutdown. And what was supposed to be three days lasted I think it was seven months. So from March to September, I was just alone. And I don't know, I feel like it really affected me. And then after that, I was just-- I don't know. After that, it just felt weird starting the semester off. I don't know. It was just different. So I don't know. This semester, I feel like it's just not-- hasn't been a good semester for me, this semester. I think next semester I'll definitely focus more on school. This semester, I've been focusing more on my own health, I guess, my own mental health."
328.0,336.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you think that being alone during that time affected your mental health?
336.0,415.0,Subject,"Yeah. I feel like it definitely did. Because I remember there was-- I think there was this one day I was, I think, after like four months, my friend, he came over and then he saw-- and I was just completely bad. I remember my hair was super long and I looked super bad. And I don't know, he kind of helped me-- he kind of uplifted me to get out of where I was. But I feel like I was in a bad position. And I don't know, I just started-- and I remember this one day, we were drinking, and then I remember I started crying. I started telling him about a whole bunch of issues that I've had in the past. But the thing is, I thought I made peace with it, but most of the stuff that I was saying, I feel like I just bottled up. And so I kind of-- everything started spilling out. And then I realized I have to take care of that before I can move forward in life, if that make sense. And I feel like that's what I've done this semester. I've been focused on school."
415.0,420.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How has that process been? Sounds like a really difficult thing to do.
420.0,511.0,Subject,"Well, it has been difficult, but I don't know, my friends have been pushing me to-- I don't know, to sort of-- so before, I would sort of ignore problems and kind of hide them. I wouldn't really tackle them straight on forward. And I feel like that was one of my mistakes. And so I feel like now I have this sort of mentality where I want to attack every problem rather than just sort of avoiding the problem itself. And yeah, I mean, it's been difficult. But my friends have been really supportive, and they've been really helpful. And yeah, and that's what I've been doing this semester more than school. And I think it's definitely healthier for me. But next semester for sure, I'll definitely focus more on school. But yeah, hopefully school is open, like physically I could go to school and everything. I don't want to do school online. I don't know."
511.0,514.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What's it been like to do that online?
514.0,563.0,Subject,"Online? School? I get really distracted. So I get super distracted. I'm listening, but then if I'm not physically active-- if I don't fidget or if I don't-- I can't really concentrate on what the professor is saying because I'm not really-- I feel like I'm not really there. Plus, my environment, I guess I don't really have-- I feel like I'm too comfortable. And so it's kind of hard to focus and study and stuff, in my opinion. But yeah, hopefully schools are open and I could go back."
563.0,593.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean, it's hard to be kind of working and not working in the same space. It's hard to switch back and forth. Sure. What are some of the other things that you have been doing in this time? You're going to school and you're working on these things. What does that look like for you? How do you kind of spend your day?"
593.0,641.0,Subject,"Well, I feel like on a typical day, I wake up. I help my family out in whatever they need. And I slowly work towards an issue that I guess I was facing. And then I hang out with friends from like 5:00 to 9:00, but we just go to the gym and we just spend it there. And then I just go on a bike ride and then just come back home. And that's a typical day for me. Yeah. That's a typical day for me. But once school starts, I'm going to have to just-- it's going to be mostly school, just mostly studying and focusing on classes and school."
641.0,648.0,Interviewer,And so what are you taking next semester? What are you excited to be doing?
648.0,689.0,Subject,"I'm going to take more, I think-- well, I have a few-- I have three or four computer science classes I have left. And then I have a few econ classes. And then that's it. So yeah, it's mainly just-- well, I'm really more excited for the computer science classes than anything. But yeah, I've heard they're really difficult. These classes are really tough. So I'm going to have to just focus more on them. Yeah."
689.0,691.0,Interviewer,Is that your major?
691.0,693.0,Subject,Computer science? Yeah.
693.0,698.0,Interviewer,And how did you kind of come to choose computer science?
698.0,778.0,Subject,"Okay. Well, so I changed my major three times. So first, I was a math major to begin with. And then I realized what am I going to do with math other than be a teacher or probably an accountant or something? And I don't want to be either one of those. So I kind of switched to bio because I kind of like biology. And then while I was a bio major, my friend enrolled me-- without me knowing, he enrolled me in this computer science class. And it was an introductory class. And I took it, and then I realized I spent more time just doing computer science than the other classes. And that's just because I was genuinely interested in it. And I realized that I would go out of my way to learn new stuff on the class. And then I got a good grade on it. And I noticed it came really easy to me than my other classes. And then I kind of enjoyed doing it too. It was like a puzzle. So then I realized that I really liked computer science, so I just switched to that."
778.0,785.0,Interviewer,That's great. And what do you hope to kind of use it for after you graduate?
785.0,863.0,Subject,"Well, I'm going to do master's, and then after, I'll probably just become a software developer or something or be in cyber security. I'm not entirely sure. But I know it's towards that path. Yeah. Yeah. I need to get back to studying that because this semester has just been bad. But next semester, I need to do better. Yeah. I feel like I lose-- when I'm doing computer science or math, I kind of lose track of time. I just focus on it super hard. But then with other classes like English or I guess dance or something, I can't really focus that much on it. Oh, bless you."
863.0,877.0,Interviewer,[laughter] Sorry. Yeah. Losing yourself is a really kind of important thing when you're finding what you want to do for a long period of time.
877.0,899.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I could write a really good essay, but I don't know, it takes me so long. I don't know. But I prefer, I don't know, math. I always kind of like doing that rather than that. So I guess it works with computer science."
899.0,909.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, it sounds like. Do you know what about math and computer science make you just kind of lose track of time?"
909.0,1064.0,Subject,"I feel like it's the puzzle aspect, sort of like a challenge. I remember when I was taking more computer science classes towards the beginning of the major. I remember I would try to solve a problem a certain way, and I wouldn't understand why it isn't working. And then I would constantly think about it throughout the whole day. And then I remember there was this one project I was doing. I overcomplicate it too. I see it now. But I remember I couldn't get this-- there was this little problem that I couldn't fix. And I didn't know where it was, where the problem was. And I was going to scrap everything, just restart. But I was already 80, 90 percent of the way through. But I was so mad that I couldn't fix it. And I just kept thinking about it throughout the whole day. And then I just kept working on it. And then I had to go home. It was already like 11:00 PM. I had to go home. And then I remember I took out my notebook, and then I was just writing code. And then the code that I wrote on my notebook on my way home was a code that fixed everything. And then, I don't know, I was just really happy that I fixed that problem. Or something that I remember, I would even-- it's kind of like-- I don't know. I remember I wouldn't even sleep. I would go to sleep, and then I would dream about how to fix this code and this problem that I was having. So it's kind of like-- I guess it's like a little obsessive, obsessiveness with fixing, like finding a solution. But I feel like that's just me too, because I feel like sometimes when there's a problem and I can't fix it, I become really overwhelmed and then I try to fix it by any means. I don't know. Also, I feel like I do have obsessive tendencies. If I start a hobby or something, I go fully in, which is bad too. I don't know. But yeah."
1064.0,1068.0,Interviewer,What do you think makes that bad?
1068.0,1148.0,Subject,"Having obsessive tendencies? I feel like because I become so concentrated in it, I can't do other things. When I was in school, I think I had to break up with my ex and then I had to not talk to any friends, delete all social media. I don't know. The thing for me is I don't really have self-control, and that's really bad because I can't-- well, it could be good I guess if you direct it. But it's bad if you try to kind of have an organized life and do multiple things. And it was really bad. But I don't know. Yeah. I've noticed that about myself. I can't complete multiple things. It just has to be one thing and fully that one thing. I don't know if it's ADHD that's acting up or anxiety. I'm not sure, but yeah."
1148.0,1151.0,Interviewer,Does it bother you?
1151.0,1215.0,Subject,"Yeah. Because I wish I had more self-control. And I've taken steps where I do have more self-control, and that's just having a little notepad or something and just writing stuff I need to get done or sort of timing myself. Okay, it's 5:00 PM already. I can't focus on this anymore. I've got to do something else. But it's kind of hard to-- once I focus on something, it's kind of hard to not focus on it and focus on something else. I think once I focus on something, it's 100% and it's hard to leave that atmosphere and go to something else. So yeah, it does bother me. I feel like I don't make time for everything I want. I just make time for one thing. Yeah."
1215.0,1223.0,Interviewer,Has there been anything that you feel like you missed out on because of it?
1223.0,1293.0,Subject,"Yeah. I feel like I'm mostly-- last year, I wouldn't really see my family. I would just be in school. So I missed a lot of family time. And the year before that, I missed out on-- I basically missed out, I guess, on stuff that you're not supposed to miss out on. I remember in also high school-- but that was all of high school too, so I don't really feel that bad. But a lot of people missed out on the social life in the high school I went to. So I don't know. It was a bunch of things that-- just a bunch of aspects where I feel like I missed out on. But I feel like sometimes it was worth the sacrifice, some things, so yeah."
1293.0,1299.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It sounds like you have a really supportive group of friends.
1299.0,1396.0,Subject,"Yeah. I just wish that I made time for everything. I wish I could just do everything, but I can't. I can only just do one thing and just focus on that one thing. But usually, I get really good at that one thing, like really good. I remember there was one summer where my other friend taught me how to play chess. And then that's all I did. I think it was like every day, just 15, 20 games of chess, just continuously, continuously, continuously. And I became really good at it. It was throughout the whole summer. And then one day I just stopped, and then I never went back to it again. And then yeah, I got really good. I remember in school, I would play a whole bunch of people and I would always win. But then I stopped. Yeah. I don't know. Or there was this other summer I became really good at playing eight-ball pool. And I would play with one of my friends. And I would play with him all the time. And I remember, me and him, we got so good at it that we would make our own games harder than the actual game. And then we just stopped again. I just kind of stopped that. So it's been kind of a cycle. I just focus on something entirely, and then I just stop."
1396.0,1399.0,Interviewer,Do you know what makes you stop?
1399.0,1483.0,Subject,"I feel like for the chess thing, I just kind of got bored of it or I got interested in something else. Or school started, so I kind of had to stop. For the eight-ball pool thing, I think I just got bored at it, so I kind of just stopped. Yeah. I guess it's just like-- I don't know. Maybe it was a seasonal thing. It's also easier to stop when there's not someone that's kind of pushing you. When you don't have a partner that's also helping, like a friend that's also pushing you to do it. So yeah, I guess I also stop when I prove to myself that, ""Okay, I've gotten good, and now it's just like if I want to get really better, then I just have to continuously do it for a few more years."" But I'm okay with just being good or being all right. And then I just stop."
1483.0,1494.0,Interviewer,And what do you think is the-- what is your current obsession? Or what are you working on the most right now?
1494.0,1633.0,Subject,"Oh, right now? I feel like it's the gym. I'm always at the gym. I'm always at the gym. But that's like from 4:00 to 9:00. Like from 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM. I just watch videos-- I just watch videos now, just people going to the gym. That's all I do. I was actually going to stop this obsession, but then my friends, they've been pushing me to go, so I've started to go more and more. But I feel like I'm slowly stopping. So yeah, that's one of my latest ones. I think I probably know the next one too. Mainly the next one's just going to be school. But yeah, I wish I could make the time for everything. I'm pretty sure I can, but I just don't-- it's hard to bounce from thing to thing, like bounce from one thing to another thing. I don't know. I remember I worked at this fast-food restaurant. I worked at Chipotle. I think it was three years ago. Even when I worked there, that became an obsession because I remember I would always want to be there. Even on days I wouldn't work, I would always want to be there, even if it's just to say hi to my friends there. And then they noticed that, and they gave me the most hours out of everyone. They gave me I think it was like 50 hours. And I was happy with that. The most time I spent there the better. And I became really good at it too. But then I left after a couple months. But there were talks of me being a manager at that place. But I don't want to be a manager. I think that was just my obsession."
1633.0,1643.0,Interviewer,So school is the next one. And you said you were going to try to get some sort of internship. What are you thinking in terms of that?
1643.0,1666.0,Subject,"Basically, I'm just going to apply to any internship that I see, and hopefully I get one. I just want to have something, I guess, under my belt just for master's and for some experience to kind of dip into that, into whatever field. So yeah."
1666.0,1667.0,Interviewer,Do you think it'll be [crosstalk]?
1667.0,1669.0,Subject,School [has usually?] been the one that-- sorry.
1669.0,1674.0,Interviewer,"No, sorry. I was just going to say do you think it'll be computer science related or--?"
1674.0,1693.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. It's computer science related. I'm also economics major, but I don't really pay attention to that. But yeah, I forgot what I was going to say. I think--"
1693.0,1694.0,Interviewer,I'm sorry.
1694.0,1698.0,Subject,"No, it's okay. Wait. What were we talking about before?"
1698.0,1705.0,Interviewer,"We were talking internship, and you said you wanted something under your belt before your master's."
1705.0,1741.0,Subject,"Oh. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know. Oh. I think school has always been that obsession thing though. Yeah. I notice when I have an obsession, I have to stop social media because then social media becomes that obsession. What?"
1741.0,1743.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk]-- go ahead.
1743.0,1823.0,Subject,"I think I'm actually like this because-- I'm thinking about it. I think I'm actually like this because my-- so when I was little, my parents were super strict on me. My parents were super strict on me. And I remember I wasn't allowed to play video games. So I had no video games growing up. And I wasn't really allowed to watch TV a lot. I think it was like one hour, Monday through Friday. And then I would be timed. So once that hour was up, you can't watch any more TV. And so I feel like I never really had that self-control, I guess, discipline growing up because things were already kind of set for me. So maybe that's why I don't have that self-control, discipline now. Although I should probably build on it. I should probably start developing it now. Yeah. That's just a theory though. I don't know. But yeah."
1823.0,1831.0,Interviewer,That's an interesting theory. Do you have siblings?
1831.0,1834.0,Subject,Yeah. I have a sister.
1834.0,1837.0,Interviewer,Do you think she's similar?
1837.0,1979.0,Subject,"I mean, me and her were kind of raised differently, so. They were less strict with her. So also, something that I think I should note is that my mom was sort of-- she has sort of this perfectionist mentality. She wants everything to sort of be perfect. And if there's one slight flaw or something, she just starts crying or goes on a rampage or something. So my sister was kind of a trial period, so they use her to sort of see what was wrong, what worked and what didn't work. And so they sort of-- my mom sort of tried to do everything that didn't work for my sister, use that against me, if that made sense. So I think they gave my sister text messaging on her phone or something, and then they stopped that. She was getting really distracted with that. And they didn't give me text messaging. It was sort of like that. So it was really different, me and my sister, on the way we were raised. But yeah, I don't really have that much self-control, I realize. Because I remember when I-- so I went to school upstate for a year and then I transferred back to the city. And I remember when I went upstate, I had no control. I was failing all my classes, and I was just going to parties every weekend and then just hanging out with friends. And that's all I would do the whole year. And I had to distance myself from most friends and transfer out just to get back on track on school. So I don't know."
1979.0,1981.75,Interviewer,Was that for college?
1981.75,1982.0,Subject,What?
1982.0,1984.0,Interviewer,Was that for college or--?
1984.0,2064.0,Subject,"Yeah. Upstate for college. Yeah. So I don't know. I guess it might be environmental, like my parents. But it might also-- I feel like it's also the ADHD thing. I just focus on one thing. And then yeah, I don't know. It's one of those or it's both. But yeah, I don't know. I just know that I have to just try not to be like that because there's going to be multiple things I need to work on and not just one thing. Actually, my cousin is like that. I'm thinking about it now, and he also has ADHD. So it might be because of that. I don't know. And my dad's like that too. Yeah, my dad is like that. Yeah. So yeah, it might be the ADHD thing, so. ADHD runs in my dad's family. They focus on one thing and they don't really care about the other things. So yeah, I'm pretty sure it's because of that. I don't know."
2064.0,2066.0,Interviewer,It runs in the family. Yeah.
2066.0,2077.0,Subject,Yeah. It runs in my dad's family. I have cousins that have to take Adderall just to focus. So I'm pretty sure it's--
2077.0,2081.75,Interviewer,It almost sounds like you have the opposite problem.
2081.75,2082.0,Subject,Huh?
2082.0,2085.75,Interviewer,It almost sounds like you have the opposite--
2085.75,2086.0,Subject,Like what? Like the opposite--
2086.0,2093.0,Interviewer,Like you're really focused instead of not able to focus.
