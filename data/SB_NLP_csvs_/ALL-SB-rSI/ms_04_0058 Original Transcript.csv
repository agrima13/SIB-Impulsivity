1.0,2.0,Interviewer,Awesome.
2.0,21.0,Subject,"So I'm going to just say this again. You've already heard this. So first, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to talk with me. Like I mentioned, our conversation will be recorded for analysis. And in this part, I'd like to get to know you and learn what your life is like. And so how have things been going for you lately?"
21.0,53.0,Interviewer,"Things have been going for me lately very relaxed, actually. I have school next month, and I think I might travel to my homeland technically, with my uncle, I think. And yeah, life is going kind of relaxing, to be honest. I kind of don't want to go to school, but I kind of do. I don't know. So I guess school-- I mean, life at the moment is actually all right. And I got there, so I kind of can skip school a lot. So kind of happy about that."
53.0,59.0,Subject,What are some things that you're looking forward to at school?
59.0,84.0,Interviewer,"3D printer, kind of prototypes, friends, and cool teachers, to be honest. I fuck with them to be honest. They mad cool. What else I'm looking forward to? That's kind of it. I'm not looking forward to learning at all."
84.0,87.0,Subject,Could you tell me more about the 3D printer stuff?
87.0,109.0,Interviewer,"Okay, okay, okay, okay. The 3D printer stuff is you go on a program, you design it, and then you just 3D print it. And that's literally it. And I don't know really what to experiment with, because I haven't been there in person. So yeah, I have to find that out [on my own?]."
109.0,111.75,Subject,"So this is technology, right?"
111.75,112.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
112.0,116.0,Subject,"Yeah, is this something you're really interested in?"
116.0,128.0,Interviewer,"I mean, yeah. It's a coding and technology school. So yeah. But I kind of hate coding. Actually, I hate coding. So yeah."
128.0,130.0,Subject,What about it don't you like?
130.0,147.0,Interviewer,"It's coding. You just type shit. And I hate a bad teacher, I think. So I just really hated it, and I despise it. But I have a other mentor, that's teaching me how to kind of use it better and kind of hack a little bit. So [I'ma just do that?]."
147.0,149.0,Subject,Could you tell me a little bit about the mentor?
149.0,167.0,Interviewer,"iMentor is a program where my school gave to me and everyone else. My mentor's about future jobs that you might want to pick. And I didn't choose anything, so they just gave me a hacker. And so I was like, ""Okay."" That's it."
167.0,177.0,Subject,"That's really cool. Yeah, and so you said there are some parts of school where you're not looking forward to?"
177.0,224.0,Interviewer,"[inaudible] looking forward to, I mean, schoolwork. I'm not looking forward to schoolwork. I'm not looking forward to the very-- breaks are cool, but they're so short, like one to two weeks. Before, it used to be like three. I kind of hate them for [that?]. What else do I hate? I hate teachers who are very naggy and are very mean for no reason. Okay. I don't like actually going to school and waking up for it. To be honest, before I can make breakfast on the fly and do whatever, but I can't do that no more. I can't get no breaks, so that's what I hate. Yeah."
224.0,234.0,Subject,"Yeah, [definitely?] makes sense. What do teachers nag about for you?"
234.0,271.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Teachers nag about the most stupid shit. They're like, ""Oh, you didn't do your homework,"" or, ""Oh, look at this class, like what you're doing."" If one kid just messes around and has fun, they just bring the whole class for it. I could care less about that. I literally just think about leaving school every day. So it doesn't bother me. But really, it got so much to a point where my friends or the classmates literally had to curse my teacher out, and it felt so rewarding, and it gave me the biggest smile on my face."
271.0,274.0,Subject,I see. What do you like to do outside of school then?
274.0,307.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Outside of school, I like to hang out. Or sometimes I get very worn out, because I'm always tired, I think, because I don't sleep. So I just go home, and I probably just, I don't know, do work on the train, or I just lay down, but I don't go to sleep. And mostly, to be honest, after school, I just get food afterwards with people. And sometimes I go to their houses and shit. And are you a high schooler? I'm actually curious, to be honest. Are you an adult? I'm actually curious."
307.0,325.0,Subject,"So during this interview, we're not supposed to discuss about me, but I am an adult, yeah. Yeah, I mean, tell me more. What do you do after you get food with friends?"
325.0,348.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Afterwards I get food with friends, to be honest, we literally part our ways, and sometimes we just talk and shit. We text [inaudible] the train. Actually, not all the time, because the train has bad Wi-Fi. So literally, we text on the train. Or sometimes we're like, ""Oh, come to my crib and chill for a second."" And then I ask permission from my mom, and then that's it."
348.0,352.0,Subject,Nice. You said that you were traveling?
352.0,366.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Oh, Santo Domingo, yeah. DR. Yeah, I don't know if I'm going to travel. To be honest, it's like 50-50. So I don't know."
366.0,373.0,Subject,I see. Is there a reason why it's 50-50?
373.0,394.0,Interviewer,"Because it's September, and I might have school. I mean, I'm going to have September 13, but I don't know. It might be 50-50 because, I don't know, family situations, sometimes the random stuff that comes along with family, like random birthdays and shit that I have to go to. I don't know. I hate that."
394.0,396.0,Subject,Do you see your family often?
396.0,407.0,Interviewer,"Do I see my family often? Yes, I do."
407.0,416.0,Subject,So if you were to travel would you-- you mentioned your uncle.
416.0,423.0,Interviewer,"I mean, I could travel by myself, to be honest. I'm 17. I was thinking about that, to be honest."
423.0,425.0,Subject,"Where would you go then, if you were to travel? Because since you [can go?]--"
425.0,426.0,Interviewer,Well--
426.0,427.0,Subject,--by yourself.
427.0,481.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. Okay. I [inaudible] Rome, Paris, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii. Canada. I mean, I've been there, but at the same time, I kind of want to visit because, I don't know, I want to see how cold it is. And where else I would want to go? Low-key, I want to go to Chicago or Atlanta, or I want to go to-- what's the other places called? I think it's called-- [inaudible]. I think I want to go to California or Florida, probably, kind of. I don't know. I kind of hate it there. "
481.0,483.0,Subject,What don't you like about it?
483.0,502.0,Interviewer,"What I don't like about it? Florida? Florida sucks, to be honest. The most random shit happens there. Alligators. You get tsunamis and earthquakes, and you get lava flowing from trees every week or month or year. It's so random."
502.0,512.0,Subject,"Yeah, that's nice. So you said school is going to start for you soon."
512.0,514.0,Interviewer,Yes.
514.0,520.0,Subject,"What do you do on the weekends then? After school, you [inaudible]-- then what do you do on the weekends?"
520.0,545.0,Interviewer,"To be honest, on the weekends, [inaudible] school, I do nothing, where I literally just think about school for the past two days. Because I literally have nothing to-- I mean, because I think about it a lot, but at the same time I don't do-- I think about it so much that I don't do my work at all, or I don't do my work in general, because I just hate it. Literally, I pray for the worst to happen when I go to school."
545.0,549.0,Subject,So you think about how much you hate it?
549.0,569.0,Interviewer,"Yes, I literally pray for rain to literally stop the train. I literally prayed for the brakes to break and everyone to evacuate so I can not go to school. Literally, I go that far. I don't know [why?] [inaudible]."
569.0,578.0,Subject,"So I guess what part of school, besides having to do work, don't you like about it?"
578.0,601.0,Interviewer,"How it acts and how it regulates. The schedule, it actually sucks, to be honest. I get no breaks. I just do classes, and then I'm worn out, and then I'm stressed, and then I just do more homework. And then you get more stressed and then more tired and worn out. So it's like a never-ending process."
601.0,603.0,Subject,Has summer break been good then?
603.0,611.0,Interviewer,"Summer break, I didn't even get no homework, to be honest. I didn't get nothing at all."
611.0,613.0,Subject,What did you do during your summer break then?
613.0,646.0,Interviewer,"My summer break, my first one, technically, I didn't even do anything, because I had COVID. I mean, I didn't have COVID, but COVID happened. So I just sit around and did whatever. But my second one, to be honest, this summer break, I was just doing whatever, to be honest. This summer break, I just was at home doing regular stuff, texting. And yeah, that's kind of it."
646.0,649.0,Subject,What type of stuff did you do?
649.0,650.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by that?
650.0,655.0,Subject,I don't know. What do you do beside texting?
655.0,678.0,Interviewer,"What else do I do but texting? Either read. Actually yeah, I barely read. And I read. I watched stuff that's interesting to me, what I want to do, kind of. But I just find [inaudible] like-- or literally, I just go around on my skateboard or electric scooter [inaudible], and that's [it?]."
678.0,681.0,Subject,What do you read?
681.0,700.0,Interviewer,"I'm reading The Alchemist now. And I'm reading a book called Renegades. I didn't even start the book. I just bought it. And I didn't even finish Alchemist. I didn't even start the page. I [inaudible] one page [inaudible]. I have to finish it, but yeah."
700.0,704.0,Subject,"Is this for your summer reading that's for school, or are you just--?"
704.0,721.0,Interviewer,"No. No, it's not for summer reading. The Alchemist is my sister's book, because she has summer break work. So I just took her book, because she's not reading it even though she starts school earlier than me. So yeah."
721.0,724.0,Subject,So you haven't started the book though?
724.0,726.0,Interviewer,"No, I haven't started the book."
726.0,731.0,Subject,I see. Is this the type of genre of book you like?
731.0,753.0,Interviewer,"I don't even know what the genre of the book is, literally. I literally don't even look into it. To be honest, I just got told from my family members, because they read it in Spanish first, that, ""Oh, it changes your life and changes how you think."" I'm like, ""Okay. I'll try it."" And that's it."
753.0,756.0,Subject,So what's stopping you from reading?
756.0,773.0,Interviewer,"To be honest, myself. My motivation. My motivation goes up and down, to be honest. It's mostly down. Yeah, I can finish a book in one day if I wanted to, but I just have no motivation for it."
773.0,777.0,Subject,Are there certain things that motivate you a lot?
777.0,796.0,Interviewer,"No. I don't know, to be honest. It's random to me. Literally, comes at random. I don't even know what motivates me, to be honest. Just random."
796.0,802.0,Subject,Have there been some things-- what in the past has motivated you before?
802.0,826.0,Interviewer,"What has motivated me before? Not wanting to do the same thing again, because I hated it. Motivated me? What else motivated me? Was, I don't know, just getting it done, over with. But at the same time, I haven't felt like that in a while, so yeah."
826.0,832.0,Subject,What was the time when you didn't want to do the same thing again?
832.0,850.0,Interviewer,"It started in the middle school. I hated doing the same work over and over again. Literally, just work in general, I hated it. And I never did it. And I don't know how I passed. I literally don't know."
850.0,853.0,Subject,"So it was homework repetitiveness, right?"
853.0,859.0,Interviewer,Yes.
859.0,874.0,Subject,"I see. So we covered school and the weekends. What are some things you like to do for fun, then?"
874.0,897.0,Interviewer,"To be honest, now I don't really even know, because I'm always numb. So I don't really know. Yeah, I don't know anymore, to be honest. I guess traveling's still-- I mean, traveling's still fun. I can't lie. But I don't know. That's [inaudible]."
897.0,901.0,Subject,What did you do before then?
901.0,943.0,Interviewer,"Before? For having fun? I don't know. I was a kid, so I was fooling around. You just, I don't know, have fun all the time, to be honest. I don't even know [inaudible]. I mean, I still jump around and do stupid shit. But yeah, I mean, before what did I do for fun, or what I had to do for fun? I would ride on my bike, or sometimes I would just go outside and run, or just do the most random stuff like, I don't know, stomp an ant or something, or [see?] a caterpillar. I don't know."
943.0,960.0,Subject,"So we had talked about your teachers before, and you said there were some really cool teachers out there. What did you like about them?"
960.0,1026.0,Interviewer,"[inaudible]. They spoke on my level. They were literally human. They're so human. For example, Mr. [Royal?], he's retired now, right? He was my English teacher, and he was so down to earth, bro. He was like, ""Hey, don't do that shit. Don't do that shit."" And I liked that. And he would let it slide. He was so New York. I loved it. And then I had another English teacher named Mr. W. He was so honest too, and I liked his class and everything, because he didn't teach us normal English; he taught us the English we deserve. Like, ""Oh, I'm going to teach you how to do this and this and this."" But it wasn't English; like, ""I'm going to teach you how to know people lie to you, people manipulate you to do this and that."" And you got to read books about stuff that's interesting, I don't know, like myths and world wars. I don't know. I forgot. Oh, music teacher. Music teacher [is cool?]."
1026.0,1028.0,Subject,What about your music teacher?
1028.0,1050.0,Interviewer,"He's my advisor, and he's very honest. He's like, ""Hey, cut that shit out."" I mean, not like that, but he's very honest, and he's very good and caring. I don't know. I literally can just curse at him, and he be cool. I can curse with the teachers. That's what's so cool. Because they know me, you know what I mean?"
1050.0,1054.0,Subject,Do you find that you really value honesty then?
1054.0,1078.0,Interviewer,"I do value honesty. I don't like when people hide themselves, to be honest. Or when you shield yourself. You can be a teacher and be yourself instead of being a teacher and just following all the rules. My teacher just lets us break the rules, like wear a hoodie and eat in class, but clean up yourself. It's a hoodie. It's not going to kill you, stuff like that."
1078.0,1084.0,Subject,How has this translated into your other relationships beyond your teachers?
1084.0,1114.0,Interviewer,"Beyond my other relationships? To be honest, all my other relationships, I always look for integrity, honest, trustfulness, kind of stuff. So at first, when I first meet somebody, I don't fully trust them. I give you 5%, and then if you're good and everything, I give you more and more. So I'm wary to everyone at first, yeah."
1114.0,1117.0,Subject,What does that 5% look like to you?
1117.0,1143.0,Interviewer,"That 5% of trust, I think it would be like if I approach someone, like, ""Hey. Okay. You cool,"" [inaudible] little bit. That's like 5% of trust, like, ""Okay. You're cool. I'm going to give you a little bit of [inaudible] points, but not too much, all right? Because I don't know you like that."" And then if it builds and builds and builds, then boom."
1143.0,1148.0,Subject,What does it take for somebody to gain your trust then?
1148.0,1187.0,Interviewer,"Be honest. I mean, what it takes is someone should take-- I mean, it depends, to be honest. You can be honest, or you can be honest in other means, like, ""Oh, I didn't like that shit."" [inaudible], ""Thank you. I appreciate the honesty."" And then that's criticism or some shit, and yeah. Or sometimes you can be like, ""Oh--"" I don't know. I don't know. I guess it's different. I don't have anything in my mind right now. Yeah, I have nothing in my mind."
1187.0,1190.0,Subject,Do you find that you're a very honest person?
1190.0,1197.0,Interviewer,"I mean, yeah. I literally say it straightforward what I think to people."
1197.0,1200.0,Subject,Has that impacted your life in any way?
1200.0,1236.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, before I was very shy, and I was just very timid and nervous. I still am a little nervous sometimes, but it just breaks down-- it just goes away quickly. And I'm honest. Literally, I will be like, ""Hey, teacher."" For example, my teacher had a black eye, and I was like, ""Hey, what happened to your-- what happened to your face?"" And nobody said anything, because they didn't point it out. I don't know why. It's not disrespectful. Just pointing it out. Just asking. I literally asked you what your age was, with no hesitation because I wanted to. So yeah."
1236.0,1239.0,Subject,Would you say it's been more positive or more negative?
1239.0,1259.0,Interviewer,"It depends on the situation. I'm still honest 100%, but I have to tone it down a little. If you're sad, I'm not going to be like, ""Oh wow, you really look like a mess."" That's disrespectful. I'm like, ""Oh, you kind of look down. I'll help you."" Like that."
1259.0,1272.0,Subject,I see. So do your friends appreciate it most of the time? Do you find people who are like you then?
1272.0,1285.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I do. You just encounter it. When you're yourself, you just encounter people like yourself, or people who are different, but act similar to you a little bit. [inaudible]."
1285.0,1289.0,Subject,How is your relationship with your friends?
1289.0,1299.0,Interviewer,"To be honest, at the moment, I just been texting them. Because I haven't seen them in person, person. But yeah."
1299.0,1302.0,Subject,Do you have any plans with them?
1302.0,1310.0,Interviewer,"At the moment? No, to be honest. Because we usually make our plans when we're together, together."
1332.0,1342.0,Subject,Okay. So we also talked about technology and 3D printing. Is that something that you're interested in learning more about?
1342.0,1345.0,Interviewer,Yes.
1345.0,1346.0,Subject,How so?
1346.0,1374.0,Interviewer,"Okay, okay. I was expecting that. Because with 3D printing, you can literally just make anything, to be honest, to your heart's content. If I wanted to make-- I don't know. I got bored or something, or I can make me a sword, I can literally do that. I can literally just do it out of boredness. So I like it. Because I'm always bored, so I can just make whatever."
1374.0,1376.0,Subject,What would you build?
1376.0,1407.0,Interviewer,"What would I build? What would I build? I think I would build maybe a [inaudible]-- no, like a [sheath?] of a katana, probably. I don't know. I don't know. I have a vision of a beige katana with a orange strap. It's been in my dreams, and it broke on me. So I want to remake it."
1407.0,1410.0,Subject,So tell me the story about the katana.
1410.0,1434.0,Interviewer,"I was sleeping. I was in an auditorium back in elementary school, and they were just giving out shit. And I walked up to get my katana that was beige and had a orange strap on it. I held it, and it broke in my hand, and I woke up. And I hated it. I was like, ""Damn, I got to find that shit."" Or if I can't find it, I have to make it on my own. So yeah."
1434.0,1442.0,Subject,"Is that something that you would want to maybe pursue in the future, like something related to technology?"
1442.0,1460.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, actually. In some way or some [inaudible] form. Hacking is very useful in the right hands, to be honest. So [inaudible]. But I'm a good person, not like an illegal person. Yeah, that's [the right word?], I guess."
1460.0,1463.0,Subject,But hacking requires coding?
1463.0,1474.0,Interviewer,"True, true, true, true. That's how I'm learning from my other teacher, because he's more cooler, I guess, and he can probably teach me in a more simpler way, [inaudible] more experience."
1474.0,1482.0,Subject,"So besides just writing the code, what else don't you like about coding then?"
1482.0,1529.0,Interviewer,"Oh writing it. Sometimes memorization. I'm bad with memorization, but at the same time, I'm good at it. But at the same time, there's a whole website about if you're stuck on coding, you literally just copy and paste, and that's it. So if I ever am in trouble, I'll just do that. I guess what else do I hate about coding? Writing it, reading it. Sometimes it's the presentations that my teacher gave us, because it was so much, and I hated it. He made us do a project every day, no break, and I hated it. So yeah."
1529.0,1532.0,Subject,What program do you use?
1532.0,1537.0,Interviewer,"Java and Python. [inaudible], to be honest."
1537.0,1539.0,Subject,Do you prefer one over the other?
1539.0,1545.0,Interviewer,"Python, because it's easier for me somehow."
1545.0,1551.0,Subject,Could you see yourself in the future doing something with coding-related?
1551.0,1561.0,Interviewer,"No. Kind of. I just think about hacking, because hacking is fun. If you think about it, I literally just do whatever. I customize everything I want. So I just [do that?]."
1561.0,1563.0,Subject,What would you hack?
1563.0,1589.0,Interviewer,"A TV. My TV. Or a game console, or probably, I don't know, [inaudible] or something. Or probably just a 3D printer. So if I'm at home, I could easily do it [quicker?]. I don't know. Stuff like that."
1589.0,1599.0,Subject,What would you change your 3D-- what would you change your hacking your TV to be?
1599.0,1618.0,Interviewer,"Hacking my TV to be? I don't know, to be honest. Maybe to change in a different color. I don't know. Make a command when I don't want to say it. If I can change how it programs. Instead of just using a remote, I'd talk to it or something. I don't know."
1618.0,1624.0,Subject,That's very cool. How did you get into hacking?
1624.0,1650.0,Interviewer,"I've always been interested by it. I think I played a game called Watch Dogs, and I loved how hacking is. Because it's like you're just manipulating the world to your lazy fit, I guess. In a good or a bad way. So you can go good, or you can go bad. So yeah, if I wanted to, I can just do a lot of bad things or do a lot of good things. So I just do that."
1650.0,1653.0,Subject,Tell me how you would manipulate the world.
1653.0,1705.0,Interviewer,"You can steal money from the government. You can steal people's information, social security numbers, everything like that. You can take people's computers apart. You can literally drive cars. You can rob cars. You can just, I don't know, bypass any security locks. You can literally just hack a camera and use it to your advantage. You can do a lot of things with hacking. It just breaks privacy, but we still have it around us. I can hack electricity wires. You can cause blackouts. You can change traffic lights. What's that called? [Sewer holes?]. You can actually make [sewer holes?] or spark electrical boxes, explode. Stuff like that."
1705.0,1707.0,Subject,What are some of the good things?
1707.0,1742.0,Interviewer,"What are some of the good things? Some of the good things is you report what you see, like all the bad things, to authorities. Or you can just help people in need. In a bad way, you can help people in a bad-- if someone's in poverty, you can just send them money. I mean, [inaudible] it's illegal, but it's kind of good in a way. You can literally just customize and do a lot of good. [inaudible] hack everything-- I don't know. You make things easier for yourself [sometimes?]."
1742.0,1745.0,Subject,Which side did you choose more often?
1745.0,1763.0,Interviewer,"I think bad. A mixture of good, but bad. It's like a neutral. You do some things good and some things bad. So yeah."
1763.0,1764.0,Subject,Why?
1764.0,1790.0,Interviewer,"I don't know. It was there. It's a option. You can change traffic lights, and you just cause massive cars to crash into each other because intersections and stuff. Or you can steal people's money, you get information, stuff like that. It was easy, I guess. The good thing? I mean, there's no good thing. You're just a vigilante in that game. So I can't say anything about it."
