1.0,24.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So we're recording. So first, I'd just like to thank you for taking the time to talk with me. Like I mentioned, our conversation will be recorded for analysis. And this interview is different from other interviews we do. I really just want to get to know you and learn what your life is like. So we can just get started. So how have things been going for you lately?"
24.0,58.0,Subject,"Pretty good. I actually started a new treatment program through Columbia. The Lieber Recovery Clinic if you ever heard of it. So it's my third week of doing that, I guess. Almost finished this week. So it's a bunch of group therapies. DBT, CBT, every acronym in the book. So yeah, I've been doing that. And yeah, I feel like I'm getting used to it. Getting to know the people in the group. So that's been good."
58.0,63.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's great. What have you been liking about that, specifically?"
63.0,111.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, I haven't had much of a schedule lately. I'm currently out of work, so, and I'm not in school. So having a more structured routine has been, I think, really helpful for me, and kind of a nice thing. And that's something you kind of notice right away. But yeah, also, just having kind of a peer group that maybe is experiencing some of the same things I've been experiencing in terms of challenges and things like that has been also helpful because with friends and other people that I know, maybe people you see on social media, making those comparisons can be kind of difficult. So it's nice to have people who are kind of being very open and honest about their own challenges. So yeah."
111.0,119.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Absolutely. What challenges have people been kind of opening up about?
119.0,214.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm trying to think of examples, I guess. I mean, there's typical life stuff. Maybe they're starting a new job, or thinking about getting back to work, and thinking logistically about that. Thinking about if they're ready for it. Some people are, I guess, at a different stage where, maybe, they're kind of beginning some new treatment or doing neuropsychological testing or something like that. I think someone was talking about that this week. And getting feedback from that sort of stuff can be maybe difficult, or maybe just intense. And yeah. And then just the challenges of dealing with various different disorders and anxiety and depression and things like that, which I guess are things they've been dealing with for probably a while before they come to the group. But yeah, putting that through that lens, I guess, and trying to apply it also to the more structured parts of groups, like the skills we're learning and things like that. So that can be a starting point for sharing or different conversations, so."
214.0,222.0,Interviewer,"Absolutely. So what types of skills have you found helpful, or have you been learning that are new?"
222.0,295.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's a good question. I think, to be honest, the specific skills haven't been the most helpful thing for me so far, and it's only been a couple weeks, so inevitably, some stuff is going to be more applicable than others, and not everything's going to click with every person. And that's totally normal. But I think just the idea of sharing with a group of people that you don't know outside of the group-- so not exactly strangers, but people who aren't in your life in other ways. I think that process has actually been helpful. Just being very honest with people, and maybe you have judgements about yourself, but you sort of share anyway. And then seeing how it's received, seeing how people react, and seeing that most of the time people aren't judgmental-- or not as judgmental as you are towards yourself and that sort of thing. I think that's actually been probably the most powerful part of it so far. So yeah."
295.0,307.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That sounds powerful. In terms of work, you mentioned that you're currently not working. Is that something that you see for yourself going forward?"
307.0,390.0,Subject,"Yeah. Definitely. At a certain point that is something I'd like to do. The last job I had I was teaching for middle school humanities, and I didn't have that job very long, but I guess I wonder if I would like to go back in that field of teaching or education or human services or something related. I guess I'm not sure. There were things I liked. There were things I didn't like. Maybe it's worth going back to school and getting a higher degree in something related to that. Having more opportunities to kind of learn in a more school type setting might kind of help direct me. But yeah, I'm not really sure what I would want to do. Maybe starting off with something that's a little more-- yeah. I'm not sure what the right word is, but just something that's maybe a little bit less demanding. Maybe a part time gig or volunteering. Something like that might be a better next step than jumping right back into a career type thing, so."
390.0,397.0,Interviewer,And what were some of the things that you liked and didn't like about teaching when you were doing it?
397.0,622.0,Subject,"Yeah. I liked interacting with kids and other people in general. I mean, I was an assistant teacher, but I was in a classroom with two other teachers. So it was a lot about interpersonal interactions and building those relationships with the students, with your coworkers. I liked that part of it a lot, and I did like doing some of the more intellectual work of teaching. Getting to know a subject well enough to be able to teach it, and kind of being excited about something and trying to translate that excitement to students. I thought that was pretty engaging and fun. But then, yeah, parts I didn't like-- I mean, it's a demanding job. A lot of people say that teaching is difficult, and they don't get paid enough for how difficult it is and things like that. And yeah, it was an entry level thing for me, so I wasn't so concerned about pay or things like that, but it definitely felt very demanding in the sense of just having to kind of be present every day. If you're leading a lesson or a class, then you can't really sit back. If you're having a bad day, you can't really let it show. You have to kind of be the leader of the classroom. And it's a lot of responsibility. It's a lot of-- yeah. Yeah. I don't want to say you're scrutinized all the time because it's not like students are scrutinizing you in the way that a supervisor or a principal or vice principal would be doing, but they're definitely looking to you for signs of-- are you worthy of my respect? Are you worthy of being the teacher in this room? Do you know what you're talking about? Things like that. So I guess that level of scrutiny can also be difficult, I think, over a long time. And then I actually started-- it was during this ongoing pandemic. So it was virtual. I wasn't there long enough to go back into the classroom. So that was really hard. Being a brand-new assistant teacher and not being able to interact with people in person or in a classroom. Not having that foundational relationship with the students before going virtual is really hard because then you're asking a lot of them, and you don't really have that relationship to fall back on. So yeah, there were specific challenges. There were more general challenges about the field. So yeah, I guess I think, maybe, a group is more difficult than one-on-one. So maybe that's something I could think about going forward. Being a tutor or being a counselor. Things like that. So yeah, there certainly are elements of it that could be tweaked and changed according to different roles that you can take on, different jobs, so."
622.0,637.0,Interviewer,Absolutely. Yeah. It sounds like COVID definitely played a role in terms of kind of the level of engagement that you are talking about. So what were some of the strategies that you used to bring that engagement and excitement?
637.0,782.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's a great question. I mean, I would say, yeah, at the beginning I wasn't really leading a lot of classes, but yeah, there was kind of basic tools. I guess all of the students were using Chromebooks, which was a really fortunate thing, that that particular school district could do that. So they were all virtual, and I guess we had a way of seeing if they were getting distracted or doing other things on the Chromebook. So just monitoring that is a very basic way of trying to increase engagement or try to diminish distractions, but I also think just having three of us was also useful. If it seemed like some students were not super engaged, you could kind of pull them out into breakout groups, or message them privately and maybe try to break down the lesson for them, or just ask what's going on. Be able to offer that kind of personal attention. And then yeah, just getting creative with lesson plans and being willing to use different new technological strategies. I can't remember all of the different services that we would use, but there's ways to make a virtual whiteboard or do sort of Jeopardy type games. Factual, educational games and things like that. Yeah. So I wouldn't say there was a silver bullet that completely transformed it and made it really engaging, but there were definitely little things that hopefully added up to something that was more engaging."
782.0,797.0,Interviewer,"Definitely. And you mentioned that kind of the group versus individual might be a big difference. Also, do you think that maybe the age group would play a part? How do you feel about that?"
797.0,904.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think I definitely-- well, I guess I'm not sure, but I have a feeling that I might want to try-- if I were to go back into a kind of educational setting, maybe trying with older students. I think middle school's a very particular-- it has its particular challenges, and also a particular tone and a particular type of person I think would be better at that. And yeah, I think just with the level of-- for me, the intellectual part of teaching is really interesting. I really like the content and that kind of thing, and I think that would maybe translate a little bit better to older students. High school level, potentially, just because they are kind of interacting with things at a more critical, analytical level and things like that. And yeah, I think I can speak to that, yeah, level of intellectual engagement maybe a little bit better, but it also has its own challenges. I think particularly if you're a younger, newer teacher, it can be harder to maybe manage some of the behavioral components of having older students, and they can be challenging in other ways. So yeah, I can see new challenges, and also, maybe, some things that would be more appealing about the age."
904.0,909.0,Interviewer,And what subjects are really intellectually fascinating for you?
909.0,1008.0,Subject,"I actually applied-- I mean, I have a degree in English. So I kind of applied thinking I would be teaching reading-- or, I guess, English language arts is what they call it in New York State, typically, but I actually, like I said, was teaching history because that's where they needed people, and that was actually really interesting because I did spend some time at college studying international relations, international politics and economics, and things like that. So not exactly history, but more of that social sciences side of things. So I definitely have some experience with that, and I find a lot of those topics really interesting. And it's easy to kind of draw parallels between a lot of the historical content that students will look at and the present moment as well, which I think is really fun. It makes it really tangible. I think sometimes if you're reading old books in an English class, it can feel very abstract, and math is just completely abstract, but history can feel a little bit more real to an average student. So I like that part of it as well. And yeah, thinking about current events and thinking about politics and things like that, I find that all really interesting, so. So yeah, maybe I'll continue along with that, or maybe not, so."
1008.0,1021.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I was going to ask when you were talking about continuing along if you had a sense of what you might be interested in, or where you think you want to head, what your goals are."
1021.0,1190.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's a really good question. I mean, the last year has been really challenging. So I've been very intentional about moving at a pretty deliberate pace with things. I think I have a tendency to really want to leapfrog ahead when I'm feeling better, or when some things are going well. Just wanting to kind of push that as far as it'll go, and that's not always the most sustainable method, generally, for me at least. So I think I'm trying not to think too far ahead as well, but I definitely am just trying to be honest with myself in terms of, like, ""Yeah. What do you actually want to get out of a job? What kinds of things are interesting to you?"" And I think it would be maybe interesting to try a job that's a little bit less interpersonal, even though I was saying that that's kind of a real benefit, but it also brings that kind of added pressure of having to be responsible. Having to be kind of on. Things like that. So I think it would be interesting to try a job like that, where you just kind of have your goals and your tasks, and you sort of have to fulfill them. And it's more about, maybe, your output than how you present every day. If that makes sense. I think it would be almost like a test to kind of see, is that really the thing that makes it difficult for me or not? And if I find a job like that really interesting, and if it feels like a lot of the pressures that were once there are not there, then maybe that's a path to go down. If I find it really unengaging, then maybe I really do need that interpersonal element for it to feel fulfilling and engaging and satisfying. So that's something I'd like to test, I think, going forward. So maybe that's just a goal in and of itself, is to kind of figure that part out. I don't really have a dream career in mind right now. It's really hard for me to think along those lines, but in terms of what kind of environment, what kind of setting, what kind of challenges, what kind of benefits, I think thinking along those lines is maybe the next step, so."
1190.0,1210.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I think that intentionality is really interesting. And so it sounds like you are kind of striving for experiences over a direct goal, necessarily. Are there any other experiences that you feel like would be really beneficial for you at this stage?"
1210.0,1213.0,Subject,"Career-wise, or just in general?"
1213.0,1225.0,Interviewer,"I mean, in general. It seemed to me that you're focusing a lot on growth, personally and professionally. So what other kind of experiences do you feel like you want to incorporate?"
1225.0,1389.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, I mean, living independently is kind of the other piece of the puzzle, I guess. I was living-- well, I was living with a roommate, but I was living independent of my parents and my family. When I was working as a teacher I was living in Brooklyn, and that's something I definitely want to get to again at a certain point, but I think with the job stuff, I'm moving a bit deliberately, and just kind of being realistic about, yeah, what are the challenges of that? What is kind of-- on my worst day, am I going to be able to manage? That sort of thing. So yeah, right now I'm not living independently, and it certainly removes a lot of pressures, but yeah, it can be a bit constricting as well, I guess. So I think I'd like to-- I think I would like the-- you were sort of talking about experiences, but I think I would like to have the experience of finding a neighborhood or a town that I really like. Feeling really connected to a community or just to a place. Liking the restaurants that are around. Liking the parks. Things like that. Because yeah, when I was living in Brooklyn, I also chose that place because it was a friend of a friend who was looking for a roommate. So I kind of let that be sort of the, I guess, principle deciding factor. Was the price right? I knew I was going to be working remotely, so where I was wasn't super important, and because it was kind of the middle of the pandemic, pre-vaccines, I wasn't really going out much. So that also is such a different experience of the city. A year before it would have been a completely different type of experience. So I know I can't really depend on the global situation changing, but it would be nice to kind of be able to think about, yeah, where am I going to like being out and about, rather than just thinking, ""Oh, it's a good-sized apartment. It's comfortable. It'll be good for virtual work."" I think it'd be nice to be in a place where that's not the main consideration, I guess, so."
1389.0,1401.0,Interviewer,"So you mentioned that you felt that there was less pressure in your current living environment. Could you just tell me a little bit more about that, and how you feel supported, maybe, in this environment?"
1401.0,1625.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, my parents have been-- I live with both of my parents, and then my older brother, who has a developmental disability. So he also probably wouldn't live completely independently. So yeah. And then, yeah, we have a bunch of pets and stuff. But yeah, I definitely feel very supported by my parents, which is great financially because I'm not working in terms of being able to buy food and just live. So that's a very nice thing, and it certainly removes some of that pressure. But also, just feeling like when things are difficult, the basic day-to-day things are-- if I'm having a more difficult day, knowing that there are people who will be able to help-- or offer help kind of unconditionally I think is really useful because I think even if I was living with friends, you don't really want to be dependent on them in that way. I'm not sure that that's the healthiest thing, but that's kind of what family can do in difficult times. So that's a nice thing. And yeah, just having other people in the house who are kind of doing their own things and can be a source of just-- yeah. Who you can do things with. You can go on outings with them. Just to feel less sort of isolated, I guess, is also really a helpful, supportive thing. If I was living completely alone, I think that would be difficult, as having to be, again, very deliberate, very intentional about making plans with people. and not just working and then being alone. I think that's an easy routine to fall into, so. And I've had friends who have experienced that kind of thing when they're not living with roommates and things like that, especially during the pandemic. Yeah. And I guess, just feeling, yeah, like I am very lucky to have such supportive parents, but I think, I guess, the other component is just feeling like there's not an external timeline that I'm having to adhere to or feeling like there's not this time pressure as well. There's not this time pressure to get everything sort of sorted out. Having that pressure can sometimes be a motivator, but I think for me, it is more about finding that kind of motivation, and yeah, building a timeline starting with what do I really need? What am I really capable of? Rather than something kind of arbitrary or imposed."
1625.0,1627.0,Interviewer,And you mentioned you have pets.
1627.0,1628.0,Subject,Yeah. I do.
1628.0,1631.0,Interviewer,Can you tell me about them?
1631.0,1670.0,Subject,"So I have two dogs and two cats. And I've had the cats for a really long time. Since I was in high school, I think. So they're, yeah, I guess middle-aged. I'm not really sure how long cats live. I feel like they could live forever. I don't know. So I think one of them is 11. The other's probably 8 or 9, or maybe 10 at this point. It's hard to say. They were also rescue cats. So I don't know exactly when they were born and stuff like that. Oh, you can actually see one in the frame, sleeping in the corner--"
1670.0,1671.0,Interviewer,So cute.
1671.0,1754.0,Subject,"--on my bed. Yeah. [laughter] That's Toby. And then I have a cat named Willow. And then I have two dogs. One is a English springer spaniel, and then one is a-- I guess they're all my parents' pets, really. I say my pet, but they're kind of our pets. Yeah. One's an English springer spaniel, and then one is a chocolate lab. And the chocolate lab just turned two, I think. So she's still very much a puppy. And then the springer spaniel is maybe three or four. And they love each other. They're very sibling-like, which is really sweet. And my mom currently, actually, works for the parks of a nearby town - because I live on Long Island now - as their goose patrol. Driving the geese away from the parks because they nest, and there's just so many of them that they can make the water kind of dirty and do all of these bad ecological things. So she works with my dogs driving away the geese. So they live a very privileged, happy life. Being able to kind of run around every day and be outside and explore things. So they're very blessed."
1754.0,1761.0,Interviewer,"And how do they fit into your kind of familial support system, if at all?"
1761.0,1842.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's a good question. I think that maybe gets overlooked. I mean, I really love having them, and yeah, it's nice, I guess. Yeah. There almost is a psychological benefit to interacting with animals, I think, because yeah, there's therapy dogs and things like that. So it's not a totally new concept, but yeah, I think just interacting with them. Maybe they keep me a little bit active walking them and playing with them and things like that as well, which is a benefit. And I mean, they also can be a source of responsibility. If my parents are ever traveling or something, then I'm usually the one who has to look after them, which can be a pressure, but it can also be a benefit. Kind of keeping me to a little bit of a structure. Having to wake up and feed them and take them out, and just kind of be conscious of them and things like that. So I think that's actually been a benefit as of late. Having that structure. Having that little push here and there. Yeah."
1842.0,1848.0,Interviewer,I just want to say thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me and share your experiences. This was really wonderful.
1848.0,1850.0,Subject,Of course. Thank you very much.
1850.0,1852.0,Interviewer,And I'm just going to stop the recording now if that's okay.
