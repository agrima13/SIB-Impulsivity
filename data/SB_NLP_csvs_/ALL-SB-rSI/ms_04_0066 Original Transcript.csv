0.0,6.0,Interviewer,"So the first question I will ask you is, how have things been going for you lately?"
6.0,42.0,Subject,"Things have been going okay. I'm currently on a little short vacation from my job, so I've been painting. I've also been strengthening my knowledge of my mental health, and I've been looking for ways to connect with collectors and investors for my artwork. That's really important for me. It's scary. I don't know. I developed this weird fear with connecting to the art community, but it's a community that I'm a part of, so that's important."
42.0,55.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, absolutely. So what do you think is kind of behind the fear that kind of surrounds the art community for you?"
55.0,66.75,Subject,"I've just developed-- there is a part of my practice-- okay. Do you know Adele, how she comes out with an album like once every three to four years--"
66.75,67.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
67.0,71.75,Subject,--versus other artists that come out with an album like once a year or maybe two times a year?
71.75,72.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm.
72.0,127.0,Subject,"I believe that because Adele takes so long, her work is amazing because it's not like she's pushing the work. The work is coming naturally, and that's kind of how my artwork comes along. But in grad school, I developed the other part of the practice where I was pushing my work, so I developed this weird pressure and this weird tensity and anxiety with making art that just really just brings up a lot of fear. Like yesterday, I submitted my work for a competition, and my body was tense. I felt myself being tense just doing that, so I can't even imagine-- I mean, I'm going to work through that because I need to, but I can't even imagine-- I don't know. I'm a little bit worried about what it would look like for me to do more than that. I want to, so I need to just push past that. I think that's part of it."
127.0,141.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what have you been-- so you said you were tense doing this kind of one thing. Can you describe a little bit more what that process is like for you?
141.0,146.0,Subject,Are you referring to submitting an application for a competition?
146.0,147.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
147.0,202.0,Subject,"So that was the first one that I've done, actually, since I finished grad school. I've also been thinking of-- I've been reconsidering redoing my thesis for grad school, and that also just makes me-- I don't even know how to explain. Because that's when I started to feel what I feel, the angst that I feel, and I don't want to experience that again. When you ask me what that's like, it almost feels like-- I was painting, I think two days ago, and I wasn't thinking about these goals. I was just painting. I was like, ""Oh my God, I feel amazing."" And then yesterday, there was a moment where I started to think about the goal portion of getting my work connected or collected or invested, and I just felt a tensity, a pressure. Is that what you asked me? Is that answering your question?"
202.0,203.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
203.0,206.0,Subject,I feel like I was all over the place.
206.0,216.0,Interviewer,"No. No, not at all. It sounds like it's a really stressful thing for you, and I'm sorry. That sounds really difficult. So you--"
216.0,231.0,Subject,"[crosstalk], and I'm going to push against that. Because awareness is the first part of everything, right, and now that I'm aware that that's a thing, I can find a way to challenge that."
231.0,238.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what do you mean when you say awareness is the first part of everything?
238.0,296.0,Subject,"Well, actually, I learned in undergrad-- in undergrad, I was learning about the process of change, and anything we want to change, we first have to be aware of. Or even like with research, right, we want to know what we're-- for example, in this research, you're considering voice and facial features, so we're aware that that's what we're considering. That's the first part, so the what. Do you know what I mean? So going back to what I was saying about change, if there's something we want to change, we first have to be aware of what it is that we want to change or what the problem is. Yeah. That's the first part. And then the next part is developing little goals towards that, but I'm not there yet."
296.0,318.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And so just brainstorming, what are the types of things that you find that you're becoming aware of? So you mentioned there's tension around your artwork. What other kinds of things do you think are coming up for you when you think about awareness?"
318.0,320.0,Subject,What do you mean?
320.0,345.0,Interviewer,"So you mentioned, surrounding your artwork, being aware this is a problem that you're really struggling with and tense about making artwork, and you want it to kind of flow more naturally and push less. I'm curious if that's true of any other part of your life, that you're kind of becoming aware of things more in any other domains."
345.0,398.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think that that's something that I might do more often. I think that's anxiety, really. I might do more than I might want to, observe a situation rather than experience a situation. So when you ask that, I think I do that a lot. I think I do that all the time, not just referring to my artwork. I do that with pretty much any scenario. I end up observing what's going on rather than just living and experiencing. I'm not doing that right now, but yeah, that's something that I do very often, and it could be unhealthy that I'm not living the situation. I'm not living in the moment. I'm not being as natural as I could be, and that brings up a lot of angst. So yeah."
398.0,409.0,Interviewer,So you said you're not being as natural as you could be. What do you think about-- what does being natural mean to you?
409.0,509.0,Subject,"Not overthinking. Not thinking about what I'm going to do, just doing. Not trying to be a certain way, just being, and then not worrying about the way that I'm being, allowing the way that I'm being to exist and being okay with that and not doubting. I've also become aware that I incorporated this huge critic in grad school in me, and I've been challenging that way of thinking. Because I work with middle schoolers, and I've realized how-- I don't know. I've just actually learned a lot working with them, and I'm thankful for it. I've learned compassion. I've learned not to be-- I've learned not to be as much of a critic as I was in grad school, and that's helped me progress a lot with my work because I spent a long time just getting rid of things because they just didn't feel like they were what I wanted them to be. I'm all over the place, but yeah, hopefully, that answers your question. I know you're not necessarily researching what I'm saying but rather how I'm speaking, so I guess that's okay."
509.0,533.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, absolutely. There's no right answer. It's really just what you're thinking and feeling, so this is really fascinating. So what do you think about working with middle schoolers has kind of allowed you to step back on that critical part of the art world?"
533.0,617.0,Subject,"I think I just developed this unreal expectation of what finished looks like when it comes to my artwork, of what good artwork looks like, or, no, actually what worthy artwork looks like. I developed an unreal expectation of that, and working with youth, I realized that that wasn't healthy because you can't look at a younger student's artwork through that lens. That wouldn't be beneficial for the student in any way. And so I thought about that. I'm not saying that that's exactly what I did, but I had moments where I interacted with students' work, and I just thought about myself. I reflected on myself, and I realized I'm really harsh on myself. So I've been affirming worthiness when it comes to my artwork."
617.0,631.0,Interviewer,That's great. So what is a time that you think you were overly critical of your own work?
631.0,664.0,Subject,"I think I've always been overly critical in general. I just allowed that to take over me in grad school. I allowed that way of thinking to own my decision-making, particularly towards the end, but I think I was always that way. I think in grad school, I just let that way of thinking own my decision-making. Yeah."
664.0,668.0,Interviewer,And what do you think about that environment?
668.0,670.0,Subject,About the grad school environment?
670.0,674.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What do you think made that kind of come out?
674.0,676.0,Subject,What do you mean?
676.0,690.0,Interviewer,What do you think made that hypercritical part of you speed up and kind of work overtime?
690.0,829.0,Subject,"I think that was the purpose of grad school, or I think that I took that part of the grad school experience to the extreme. There were a lot of moments of criticism. But I think I have a relationship with criticism that I kind of silenced recently, but at that time, I didn't know how to. It was difficult to silence. There's just things that I just don't allow in my life anymore that I had to kind of allow during my grad school experience, just like presenting my work and-- I don't know how to explain. Yeah. I don't even know how to begin to talk about that. But I think the hardest part for me is that my work was really intimate in grad school. It was very personal, or it came from a really emotional place. It came from my history. It came from my life.  I was exploring my life. I was exploring my past, and I was putting that, and I was having that being assessed. And that in itself is harsh. Imagine putting your life out there and sitting there and people, because that's part of grad school, criticizing the work. Even if it wasn't about my life, even if I was just putting abstract colors on the paper, that was part of a grad school experience. But yeah, I was putting my life on display and having that criticized in front of me, and I was participating in that. And people weren't necessarily criticizing my life. People were criticizing the work, but I think, in a weird level, I felt that it was my life being criticized. Yeah. I don't know. I haven't really thought about that as much as I probably should."
829.0,835.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What was that like for you? That sounds really heavy.
835.0,969.0,Subject,"I mean, I was the one who chose to explore my life the way I did, but that's just the kind of work that I do. I still do kind of work where I portray aspects of my own life. Before, I was portraying aspects of the life of people I knew, but now I portray aspects of my own life. I think that is just something that I didn't know how to navigate very well. How do you navigate portraying your life and displaying a portrayal of your life and having that being criticized? I think that's something that I'm going to need to navigate, even now, as I put my work out there. Maybe that's what I'm doing. And I think what I was-- I don't think I knew how to manage that very well, and perhaps I still might not. But perhaps it's just like I need to redevelop my relationship with that process, with that aspect of putting or portraying aspects of my life and being around people who are going to have their own thoughts and opinions about that, and [saying?] that that's okay. Because that's actually one of the things when people ask me, ""Oh, what's the work about?"" I actually prefer to ask them, ""What do you see?"" That, for me, is the kind of conversation that I want to have because I kind of want people to-- not that I want, but it's interesting for people to develop their own narrative as they look at the work. Because when you look at artwork, you want to have your own opinion. You want to have your own thoughts. You want to get to where your brain goes when you look at the work. Yeah. That's what came to mind."
969.0,990.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That makes a ton of sense. That sounds really cool. And so you said your artwork really is deeply personal and kind of about your life. What do you think made you pursue that in your artwork?
990.0,1083.0,Subject,"That's just what art has always-- that's what art is, for me. When I think of art, I-- one phrase that I have on my Instagram is, ""I live. I feel. I paint,"" and that's kind of what art is for me. I live, and there's something that I'm feeling, something that I want to [comment?] about what I have experienced. There's something that I want to have out there, but the words are not going to put that out there, or the expression, like speaking to someone, is not going to put that out there. Or it might, but not to the point that putting that on a canvas will do. When I put what I have felt about an experience on a canvas, it's almost like, ""There, that was what I wanted to say."" That's how that has started for me, which has become muffled, but that's what that has been for me. I'm not saying that I don't like expressing myself. I think that's also necessary, with words, when I'm speaking to someone about something, but there are just things that are just, ""Yeah, I don't know. Let me see it on canvas."" Yeah. Yeah."
1083.0,1109.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's beautiful. Wow. And so I don't know if this is a question that can really even be answered, but what is it like to start painting on a canvas? What is that feeling like for you?"
1109.0,1168.0,Subject,"It's interesting because with my practice now, I don't start painting-- there's something that's performative about when I start painting because I begin by thinking of an experience, and I wear different clothing. And I think of what I have felt in that experience, of what I have needed in that experience, and I record that. And then I take snapshots of that, and then I place that, and then I create a collage, and I create a narrative of that. And then I begin to paint. So I kind of re-go through an experience in my own way. And lately, I just-- you said, what is it like to start?"
1168.0,1172.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1172.0,1250.0,Subject,"Have you ever felt like you were going through an experience and there was something that you were feeling intensely, but you didn't talk about what you were feeling? Or you didn't address that feeling, or you didn't acknowledge that you were feeling that way in that moment in time. So that feeling lingered, and that feeling still lingers. So I address those feelings, those feelings that I may not have addressed at that moment in time. And it doesn't have to be negative. I address those feelings and those needs that were perhaps unaddressed at some point in my life that linger. I believe those feelings and needs linger, so I acknowledge them. So my painting doesn't start in the moment. My painting starts in something that has been going on, and then I realize that. It's a realization of those things, and then that's when the painting starts. Does that--?"
1250.0,1251.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1251.0,1252.0,Subject,Yeah?
1252.0,1282.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, totally. So what is it like when one of those-- what is the experience of realizing that there is a lingering feeling that you're going to capture through your painting? What is the process like of kind of generating or coming to realize what that lingering feeling is?"
1282.0,1285.0,Subject,What is the process of realizing that?
1285.0,1294.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What is that experience like? How does it happen for you?
1294.0,1391.0,Subject,"It just happens naturally. I think that's what makes me a painter. I think that's what makes me unique, really. It just happens naturally. And sometimes it happens with things some people say. I was hanging out with somebody the other day, and they talked about returning home for the first time, or their version of home for the first time, and how some people when they do that, they kiss the ground. And I just thought of that, what that's like, that need for home and that gratitude and that recognition of home and of recognizing home by kissing the ground that home is on. So I imagined what that would look like. So that is how my mind processes things. And that one isn't my own. That's something somebody said, but that's one other thing. I'm thinking about my own-- I think about my own relationship or my own feeling in relationship to something somebody else says, like the need for home, the need for shelter and the recognition of home and the gratitude for home. I don't know. So it's hard. I think that's just unique to me, to how I think about life. It's hard to say. Yeah. I don't know if I answered your question. That was just an example of--"
1391.0,1420.0,Interviewer,"No, that was perfect. That really illustrated the process. Thank you. So yeah, that's a really interesting feeling, right, kissing the ground when you go home and that kind of gratitude. What was going through your head when this person you know said that? What was your first reaction to it?"
1420.0,1590.0,Subject,"I think I would want to use-- right now, I'm having a hard time wanting to use that specific example to talk about my work because that is something that came from something somebody else said, and one of my biggest goals is really honing in on what I'm saying and what I am feeling. So what I do with those kind of ideas - I actually have a sketch somewhere around here - is that I put something like a Post-it with the word recycle so that my unconscious recycles how I perceive that moment so that the thought becomes more from me. So I'll give you a more specific example of something that I've already completed. When I talk about me affirming worthiness, I imagine myself speaking to my younger self, to the younger version of me that has made decisions that I may not have been as proud of or I felt I shouldn't have been proud of. And so I imagine myself what that feels like. What does it feel like to feel worried about a decision? And you see me changing my body. I actually did that for the painting. And then I imagine myself addressing that and what it's like to remind myself that I am worthy, no matter what I've done. So I began by holding my own two shoulders, and then at one point, I just held my chin up. So in the painting, there is a smaller figure kind of like shoulders down, looking up with fear. And then there's another figure painted larger, and the figure is on its knees, almost holding the other figure's shoulders but one hand on the chin as a reminder to keep the chin up. And that happened as I was posing for the painting. And I think that was the first painting where I realized what these kind of paintings could do for me. Because it wasn't just honoring my past; it was also a guide for my future, sort of like the way that I want to look at my past and the way that I want to-- so now, when I imagine that I need a reminder that I'm worthy no matter what, that image comes to mind, to keep my chin up. Yeah. I hope that answers your question."
1590.0,1609.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. So this idea of keeping your head up, so that's an important one, keeping your chin up. What's a time when you feel like you've really needed that reminder?"
1609.0,1738.0,Subject,"Last year. Man, last year, or even the past two years after grad school, I just had this deep need to apologize. I had this deep desire to-- yeah. And it was almost like I ingrained this weird desire to apologize for everything that I do, I would say, throughout my life but more specifically during that point in time. But I feel like that's a reminder that we all need as people. I've been questioning what a mistake is, what an error is. I've been questioning that. I've been questioning how we think about an error that we make as a person, how we look at that. When you make a mistake, how do you think about that? When you make an ""error"" - and I'm putting that in quotations - how do you think about that? How can we hold the decisions that we've made that we might not be proud of? And even that, I'm questioning that. Why? Why do I need to think of a decision that I've made as a mistake or something that I'm not proud of? Why do I need to hold that in my brain, in my body? I think we deserve better than that because we're not really meant to be perfect. So yeah. So the concept of keeping my chin up reminds me of that, and it helps me question that. These are the kind of conversations that I like to have about my work, by the way."
1738.0,1743.0,Interviewer,"Good. Yeah, this was so interesting."
1743.0,1745.0,Subject,Sorry. Yeah.
1745.0,1798.0,Interviewer,"No, don't apologize, please. It's really wonderful to kind of connect in this way and understand your process and some of the things behind your work. Oh gosh, I had a question, and I lost it. Yeah. So this notion of, ""What is a mistake, and why does it have to be labeled a mistake?"" is really interesting. Can you think of an example of something that you're kind of revisiting that you initially thought was a mistake but maybe does not seem so much like one now?"
1798.0,1927.0,Subject,"I think about the paintings I made in grad school. Man, none of them exist anymore. Yeah. And I'm thinking about how I hold that memory, how I hold that experience, how I hold those paintings, how I hold how I painted, who I painted. And I think for two years, I just kept saying-- post grad school, I was like, ""That was a mistake. Why did I paint that way?"" And I just cannot keep holding my decisions in my head like that. So thinking about that objectively is-- there is nothing beneficial to me or to anyone else for me to hold my decisions in my brain and in my body like that. So that's why I question, ""What is the benefit of holding onto a mistake as a mistake?"" I mean, there are things like-- I think that concept of a mistake, there's a spectrum there. I don't know. There are just things that are just not okay, like the law. Right? Right? But I think I'm not necessarily speaking to illegal things, or actually, I don't want to get there. I want to get to the concept of a mistake and how we hold-- not just the action, but how we hold onto that, how we remember that ourselves, our own decisions ourselves. Because we can almost carry those things, and those things could weigh us down, and I just think about, ""How beneficial is that to anyone?"" Yeah. Yeah, that comes to mind."
1927.0,1953.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And so this is something that you've said a few times, which is really fascinating, this idea of holding it in your brain and your body, and how things can weigh on you. What do you think the connection is, or what is the connection for you between holding on in the brain and it also affecting your body, holding onto it in your body? What is that like?"
1953.0,2123.0,Subject,"I read a book - I don't know if you have heard of him - by something van der [Kolk?]. The book is called The Body Keeps the Score. And even though I can't tell you everything that I read about the book, just even the title is enough to say that the body remembers. Yeah. So, I don't know. I'm not an actor. I'm not a performer, but when I am working on my paintings, I recall situations as if I was there. I recall something that I have felt or needed as if I was there, not just in my thoughts but in what I do. Yeah. I don't really want to think of my body keeping score - I've been challenging that - but I recall. I mean, we have muscle memory. We have muscle memory. I think that is the best example of a response to your question is we have muscle memory. There are things that we don't need to-- when we know how to drive, sometimes we don't even need to think about turning left or turning right and having to click. That just happens naturally. Our body remembers. I think, similarly, our body can recall something that our body has needed or felt without us having to think about it. I think our body can just recall naturally. Yeah. So I think our body can hold onto things. I think our body does hold onto things, and I've been very mindful of that, really. Sometimes, when I'm feeling a lot of anxiety or really tense, I would put pressure-- I do it sometimes in my hand, or I do it sometimes here, just as a way of reducing the pressure that I feel because I do feel intense pressure, and that could be like maybe that's too much detail. Or I'll do this here till I calm myself down, but that's separate. That's just my own anxiety to keep the conversation on our-- I believe my body recalls naturally. I think anybody's body can recall naturally. So that's why I'd say that I'm not a performer. When it comes to me preparing for a painting, I don't consider myself a performer. I'm not performing; I'm experiencing. I'm reexperiencing, or I'm experiencing a moment in time or a moment in life, and then I take that and put that on a painting."
2123.0,2125.0,Interviewer,That is so cool.
2125.0,2135.0,Subject,"I think that is called performance if I go to terms I've learned, but I just have a hard time with that. You know what? I'm going to push-- I'm going to challenge that a little bit and say that--"
2135.0,2138.0,Interviewer,You don't have to be one if you don't want to be.
2138.0,2140.0,Subject,"No, I'm just-- yeah."
2140.0,2141.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay.
