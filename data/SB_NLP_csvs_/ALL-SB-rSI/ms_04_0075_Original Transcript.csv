2.0,5.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,52.0,Subject,"Not so good, to be honest. I've been dealing with a lot of personal stuff, but psychosis-wise, I feel like I have gotten a bit better or psychosis risk-wise. I've been taking my medication very often and being very diligent and what time I take it and how often. So I think that has been helping, so far, with the symptoms and-- so yeah. In that case, I am doing better."
52.0,63.0,Interviewer,"Well, that's good to hear. I'm sorry that other things have been challenging, though. Would you want to speak at all about some of the things that have been challenging, or would you rather talk about something else?"
63.0,77.0,Subject,"Well, I'll just do a brief summary. With my friends, things haven't been the best. Depression-wise, things have been really difficult, so."
77.0,107.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, yeah. I think at different times, some things are doing well, and some things are not doing as well, and yeah. Sorry to hear that that's the case for you right now. Besides taking the medication regularly, and all these other things that you've been doing, which seems really great, especially considering maybe some of the other things that you've been struggling with. Have you found anything else to be really helpful in terms of mitigating some of those psychosis risk symptoms?"
107.0,141.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think art therapy, just drawing and-- really help venting through my art. I think that one has been a really good coping mechanism. Excuse me. Also, I think, music, just in general, listening to music. That's really been just something to really get out my stress and deal with problems."
141.0,150.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So what kind of brought you into the art realm, and how did you discover that that was something that was helpful for you?"
150.0,193.0,Subject,"Well, I think I've always been venting through my art since I was really little. I just didn't realize it. I've always been a drawer, and I've always loved art and expressing myself through it. So I think that I just-- as I got older, it never really left me, and my dream job is a tattoo artist. So I can continue to draw and actively make art as my career, so yeah."
193.0,215.0,Interviewer,"That's amazing. That would be so cool to be a tattoo artist. Wow. So when you say that, you vent through your art, and you kind of relieve stress. Do you have to do any specific type of art, or is it just kind of the act of doing something-- how do you go about that process of releasing those emotions through your art?"
215.0,249.0,Subject,"I attempt to draw what I feel at the moment and how intense the emotions are, and I try to display it through my art. So by doing that, I'll draw just random people, and you can tell that they're going through a specific emotion, and yeah. It kind of just happens. I don't really plan it, so I just go through the motions of whatever I feel, and I just display it on paper."
249.0,268.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. I'm sure that's easier said than done, maybe, but that sounds really-- at least, is a great way to kind of get that out. And then what do you feel once you are able to put that on paper and kind of get that out-- how does that translate in your emotional state?"
268.0,312.0,Subject,"It relieves me. I think I'm able to feel a bit of relief, even though my emotions may not be completely gone. But the relief of getting that out, and actually just - sorry - I'm having trouble explaining it. I think just having it on paper or writing it down, even just releasing all of that pent-up emotion, can really just make everything lighter, in a sense."
312.0,329.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And is there any other purpose that you have for this art other than releasing all of this emotion and all these thoughts, or does it serve in any way to have any other purpose?"
329.0,362.0,Subject,"Usually, if it's been-- or it's mostly for me, and the purpose is to just get everything out because using that art, in my opinion, it's supposed to be messy, and it's supposed to be kind of sporadic and not perfect. So I think it's mostly just for me, and it doesn't really serve any other purposes other than helping me feel better."
362.0,383.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. No. I guess I just was wondering. Maybe, if it almost is like a diary, in that, you can look back and see, ""Oh, this is how I was feeling."" So I just was wondering if it has a kind of chronological aspect to it or if it's more of just, kind of get it out, in the moment and leave it be, and kind of put it [crosstalk]?"
383.0,404.0,Subject,"Actually, I think it's more, in the moment, but at times, when I do look back at my art. It is almost like a diary, and it is almost like, ""Oh, shoot, wow. That's how intense it was at that moment."" And I actually like to look back at it, sometimes. And days where I am feeling lighter and a lot better, it's relieving to look back and feel like, ""Oh, well, I got over that."""
404.0,421.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Totally. And do you feel like this type of art is also something that you like to do in those, maybe, lighter or happier times, to kind of document, in some way, those emotions, or is it really more kind of to get out more of the negative emotions?"
421.0,436.0,Subject,"I think it's more to get out the negative emotions because I notice that when I'm more elevated and when I'm doing a lot better. My art reflects that, so my art usually reflects what I'm feeling exactly."
436.0,462.0,Interviewer,"Got it. Yeah. Well, thank you for sharing that with me. I just think that's so cool to have that artist's perspective on going through difficult times and how you've been able to get through that. So art and music, you also mentioned. And is music something that you like to also create, or is it more just to kind of absorb for you-- how does that play into the picture?"
462.0,518.0,Subject,"So music is more of a listening type of thing. I actually used to play violin and create music, but I hated it, so I stopped. Sorry. I think that I usually like to listen to music while I'm doing my art, so it kind of intensifies the emotions of it, but it also kind of relieves. And I think both together are a really powerful concoction, and I like to add both. So I'll do art based off of a specific song, or I'll do just - sorry - I'm getting a little lost."
518.0,520.0,Interviewer,"Oh, no worries."
520.0,546.0,Subject,"Okay. Yeah. I think music helps me understand my feelings more. So with music, I'm able to usually connect, really, the dots and what exactly I'm feeling. So both of them kind of go hand in hand for me."
546.0,556.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. And how is it that you feel that music really illuminates some of the feelings that you're feeling and helps you understand them?
556.0,584.0,Subject,"I think it's specific songs and the specific lyrics or message that they have or [hold?]. I think that kind of just relating to a specific song can just feel like I'm less alone and can make me feel comforted in a time where I'm really lonely, so."
584.0,607.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And are you somebody who focuses more on relating to the lyrics and having those words kind of bring words to your experiences, or do you feel like the music itself-- the rhythm, the beat, [inaudible] to whatever's in the song kind of rhythmically and musically is what brings out those emotions for you or maybe a combination?"
607.0,636.0,Subject,"It's, honestly, a combination of both. I think having the music itself bring out those emotions and then having myself actually relate to them-- to the lyrics and relate to the rhythm and just everything. I think those go hand in hand in kind of comforting me and just relating to me in general."
636.0,661.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. And in terms of the loneliness aspect. Do you feel that you seek kind of company in those times physically, or do you feel like these kind of self-care, releasing emotions practices fill that feeling for you, in a way that, maybe, people don't at that time?"
661.0,685.0,Subject,"I think because I tend to isolate myself either way, and I usually don't like to have people around me in those times. So I think the music and art kind of fill in that void for me and just-- yeah. Kind of replace the comfort of a physical person."
685.0,705.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. So do you feel like the isolating yourself part of that is - sorry - I'm just trying to understand your experience-- but is that more of a [preservational?] step that you take or is that something that you kind of don't, necessarily, mean to do, but it just kind of happens sometimes?"
705.0,717.0,Subject,"I think I don't really mean to do it. It happens. Sometimes I do kind of [mean it?] because I do need it, but for the most, I think it just naturally, just occurs."
717.0,743.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. And so even though you've been going through kind of highs and lows, I guess, in this period. Do you feel like there are any kind of constant things that are going on in your life, whether it's school or work or anything that's kind of keeping you in a certain kind of grounded state, or maybe, contributing to your stress-- what else is kind of going on in the background?"
743.0,781.0,Subject,"So homelife definitely, contributes to the stress, but sometimes it can help, but for the most part, it's a big contributor to my issues. But school, also another one, but recently, I had kind of a breakthrough with school, so I think I'm on a good track to graduating at a great time, but for the most part, in the past, school has always been a stressor but now, I feel lighter about it, so that's--"
781.0,782.0,Interviewer,[That's definitely good?].
782.0,783.0,Subject,Yeah.
783.0,786.0,Interviewer,Wow. So could you tell me a little bit about the breakthrough?
786.0,803.0,Subject,"Yeah. So my principal, she spoke to me. She said in the-- like these iLearns, they're a special court - sorry - I'm trying to explain it. It's--"
803.0,805.0,Interviewer,Yeah. No worries.
805.0,880.0,Subject,"--a website for courses to do online. And so I don't enjoy going to class, and I'm going to be honest. I skip class a lot. So this is actually a new way for me to do my work in a way where I can actually just be alone, and it almost teaches you for-- so it's almost like I'm teaching myself, but I'm just reading it, so yeah. I don't know. I think the act of being able to be alone and without a teacher and having a different way to learn. I've already seen that I'm actually doing it and rather than-- the work that I'm supposed to do. [I can?] do this, and I just feel like I have a new way to get back on track and to just graduate. I feel almost relieved that I'm not stuck in a rut and that there's no one to help me. I could tell that she actually cares, so."
880.0,885.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Wow. That's so nice to be seen by her in that way. I feel like.
885.0,886.0,Subject,Definitely.
886.0,900.0,Interviewer,So yeah. What was it that you felt was contributing to you being in that rut before? What was it that was kind of challenging or preventing you from embracing that setting?
900.0,982.0,Subject,"I think some kids at school-- sometimes, I'd get made fun of, just for the way I dress or something or the way I looked, just in general. People just kind of say things. It's not bullying because it doesn't happen every day, but it happens sometimes, and when it does happen, it's very discouraging. So I don't want to go to class, so I avoid them. And I think that one was just something-- being embarrassed of myself, dealing with that embarrassment is just-- yeah. So to avoid it, I just avoid those kids, basically. But also, doing the work has always been a struggle, and being able to keep up with specifically, math. That's also another thing that's just been a struggle, but I think when I get discouraged about school and when I'm having trouble in school, that just kind of sends me in a spiral to not do anything. And I don't have the motivation to do it because I already feel discouraged, so yeah."
982.0,996.0,Interviewer,"So yeah. Kind of stepping out of the discouragement by this new environment is, maybe, empowering in that way to kind of push through-- even things that are challenging, just because you have this new approach. Is that kind of what you're saying as well?"
996.0,997.0,Subject,Yeah.
997.0,1033.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. That makes total sense. I'm so annoyed to hear about those people making fun. There are just always people who are out to, uh. It is so frustrating, uh, anyway. I'm sorry that you had to experience that and that the negative factor and totally [imagine?] that it was difficult to even concentrate on learning when people are focusing on other things. Anyway. So how long have you been on this new process of the at-home learning thing?"
1033.0,1072.0,Subject,"Actually, it recently started. So I still go to school, but I just get to do it at home. So it happened, maybe, on Wednesday. I believe Wednesday or Tuesday. And I went up to her, and I just-- because she told me about it, but she set everything up for me, and I've been working on it. And that's usually very out of character for me, to work on something at home, but with this, I feel like I have a new motivation and a new air about school, so."
1072.0,1081.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And maybe do you-- well, do you feel that it's showing you kind of what you can do on your own, in a way that, maybe, you didn't know before?"
1081.0,1110.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely. She actually printed out my transcript, and she showed me my grades from 9th grade, and they were 90s, 80s. I had a 90 in math, which was insane to me. And it's almost like I forgot that I could actually-- I have the potential to actually graduate because my grades now are all Fs because of how much I neglect school now."
1110.0,1118.0,Interviewer,"Right. So that shows you how-- when you are able to kind of apply yourself and do that, how far you could go, which is so exciting."
1118.0,1119.0,Subject,Yeah.
1119.0,1129.0,Interviewer,"So how do you see that, maybe, playing into next steps for you in terms of getting to graduation and maybe, even beyond that?"
1129.0,1188.0,Subject,"So now I know how many credits I need to graduate, so based off of what she showed me - sorry - based off of what she showed me. I'm aware that I can knock out 10 credits by the beginning of September. So that's already a big relief, and if I knock out 10 credits by September, that means I'm back on track to graduating, and I'm perfectly fine. And either way, I'm going to be a senior next year, so that's kind of just cool that I don't get left back. But the fact that I can knock out 10 credits and be perfectly okay. That is such a motivator and such a eye-opener because I thought I had more credits, so yeah."
1188.0,1194.75,Interviewer,Yeah. So now you're not stuck in that feeling of being behind because you're not behind. You're just--
1194.75,1195.0,Subject,Exactly.
1195.0,1203.0,Interviewer,"--[inaudible], nice. Oh, that's awesome. So is this summer going to be when you're able to make up those 10 credits?"
1203.0,1227.0,Subject,"Yes. And I actually enjoy summer school more than regular school. Sorry. So yeah. I think I'm going to be-- I think this summer, hopefully, will be a pretty good one because I'll be making up the work, and I'll feel like I am actually doing something."
1227.0,1234.75,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. It definitely helps a lot of people to have some degree of structure and stuff that they're working on, so."
1234.75,1235.0,Subject,Yeah.
1235.0,1251.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I'm excited for you. That's awesome. Yeah. And how do you feel now that you're on this good track and graduation's in sight-- how do you feel like that will feel to finish everything and be able to graduate?
1251.0,1281.0,Subject,"I know that that's going to be one of the best feelings in the world. I know that's going to be such a relief, especially because this year, I genuinely thought it was going to take me 5 years to graduate. So my principal telling me that I'm going to be able to graduate next year if I follow her plan, in which I really think I am. So I know that's going to just be a wonderful, wonderful, pure euphoric feeling, just so good, yeah."
1281.0,1299.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so exciting. That is so exciting, yeah. And how do you feel just knowing that somebody kind of looked out for you and made this plan for you and that it's on track to work-- how does that change your experience as well?"
1299.0,1333.0,Subject,"It just feels like I was seen. I felt like [inaudible] gave up on me, and no one really cared anymore, and my teachers literally gave up on me, and so seeing that someone actually cared and actually searched for me-- because she's not doing it with all the kids. She's only doing it with a specific amount of kids. And I think around four kids, that's she's doing it with, and the fact that I was a part of that four, just feels so, so good. I just feel really, really good about it, yeah."
1333.0,1344.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I can imagine. Do you know what went into her decision process of selecting those four, of who would be kind of in this group?"
1344.0,1374.0,Subject,"Well, me and her-- I had a moment during the school year, around January, I believe, where I tried to kill myself, and the school ended up finding out. So she's aware of my mental health issues and she's aware of my struggles and I think that may have impacted her decision. I think she really wants to see me succeed."
1374.0,1431.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think, seeing that and being kind of called to action as a result of your struggles is still a wonderful quality of hers, to just kind of say, ""This person can do it anyway."" ""This person can succeed. I believe in them."" I mean, I'm just so happy that you've had that experience of someone believing in you in a context where, unfortunately, some of the kids got kind of left behind in that way. Okay. So if school's been going better. I'm curious-- again, only if you want to talk about this-- if the working from homeschool setting has had any drawbacks in terms of stressors at home or if that's been really a distraction or manageable? What has that been like to be doing school from home kind of in that context?"
1431.0,1460.0,Subject,"It's honestly been a distraction, and I think it's been good. I feel like my mom is kind of nicer because she knows I'm doing work. So I think it's been a positive experience so far. And I think that my mom's kind of feeling more relieved about school because that was a big reason why we fight and why we would have conflict. So I think, overall, it's going great."
1460.0,1473.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That sounds wonderful. And have you been communicating with her directly about these changes, or has your principal been in contact-- how has she kind of gotten the memo that you're in this new page?"
1473.0,1492.0,Subject,I told her everything. And I told her about it last week when I first heard about it because I knew it would make her more relieved and happier because I know that was something that was really bothering her.
1492.0,1493.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1493.0,1496.0,Subject,So she reacted to it very well.
1496.0,1497.0,Interviewer,That's so nice.
1497.0,1498.0,Subject,Yeah.
1498.0,1517.0,Interviewer,"And do you see this at all impacting your kind of future career goal of a tattoo artist in any way-- do you see this as frightening that future and making yourself work towards that, or do you feel like, maybe, they're unrelated?"
1517.0,1542.0,Subject,"I think that's going to brighten my future. I think this is shining a light on the path now, and now I know where to go from here because eventually, I want to own my own tattoo shop. And I want to go to college for business, so now this is really going to help me possibly get into a college that I want in the city. So I think this is actually really helping me."
1542.0,1556.0,Interviewer,"Totally. Wow. That's so exciting. That's such an exciting next step. Okay. Well, I, first of all, just want to thank you so much for your time. I don't want to go over on your time, so if it's okay, I'll stop the recording."
1556.0,1557.0,Subject,It's totally fine.
