2.0,5.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,23.0,Subject,"Good. Good. I just ate a sandwich as I mentioned. And I've been doing some gig work. I've been coaching tennis a little bit, working on music, typical things."
23.0,27.0,Interviewer,"Is tennis something that you've always done, or is this a new hobby?"
27.0,35.0,Subject,"It's kind of an on and off thing. I'll see jobs online, and I'll be like, ""Oh, that's well paid per hour."""
35.0,41.0,Interviewer,"Got it. And then were you a high school tennis player, or?"
41.0,55.0,Subject,"Yeah, a little bit but not too serious. But it's good work if you can it, so. I just basically trump up my resume a little bit and get out there."
55.0,59.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Cool And it sounds like that would also be good exercise and [staying?]--
59.0,64.0,Subject,"Definitely, which is vital."
64.0,76.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, definitely. Just to let you know - I didn't say this earlier - part of this interview-- it would be extremely helpful, basically, if your face were somewhat centered and close."
76.0,78.0,Subject,"Okay. Okay. How is that, better?"
78.0,88.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's great. It's just because we basically will go through, and we'll transcribe this conversation and totally anonymously remove anything--"
88.0,89.0,Subject,"Cool. Cool, cool."
89.0,96.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It's just helpful. Okay. So what else has been going on? So music, is that something you've been doing forever too, or what's--?"
96.0,102.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I have a band, and we have a new album coming out. And I'm excited about that."
102.0,103.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh.
103.0,113.0,Subject,Yeah. And we're going to be in a movie with Justine Bateman. Jason Bateman's sister is going to be in it. And--
113.0,114.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh.
114.0,147.0,Subject,"Well, they already did the movie. And one of the guys from the office, a couple of pretty solid names-- so we're happy about that. And it was last year, but it took them forever to actually-- they told us last year. We were like, ""Oh, that's great. Let's see it already in action."" But it took a little while. But now the movie-- so I forgot that it was even happening. I believed it was a fake movie--"
147.0,148.0,Interviewer,That's funny.
148.0,160.0,Subject,"--even though we signed a contract and everything, so. Yeah. And now it's going to be out next month. So that's a nice little pick-me-up."
160.0,161.0,Interviewer,Wow.
161.0,168.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah. It's good motivation.
168.0,170.0,Interviewer,And does that--?
170.0,171.0,Subject,[crosstalk]--
171.0,178.0,Interviewer,"Is this kind of a first step for you in terms of getting into the movie industry, or is that not really something that you're--?"
178.0,194.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm not too obsessed with that. But yeah, I think it's not a bad thing to have your songs in a movie, so I'm feeling good about that for sure."
194.0,197.0,Interviewer,That's so cool. I can't even believe that. So [crosstalk]--
197.0,207.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. We'll do a watch party, and we'll all get [EEG'd?], and we'll see if it's any good [laughter] or not."
207.0,208.0,Interviewer,That's funny.
208.0,210.0,Subject,That took forever by the way.
210.0,211.0,Interviewer,It did?
211.0,213.0,Subject,It took three hours.
213.0,217.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. Usually, it only takes two, most."
217.0,220.0,Subject,Do you know what they do for that? Are you aware?
220.0,223.0,Interviewer,"I have never done it, but I know that you listen to stuff."
223.0,231.0,Subject,"Have you heard the beeps? They're quite high-pitched. Oh my God, it's like beep, boom, boom, beep, boom, beep."
231.0,232.0,Interviewer,"Oh, man, [crosstalk]."
232.0,238.0,Subject,And there are all these-- there's all these fish floating by and stuff. It's wild.
238.0,239.0,Interviewer,Interesting. Wow.
239.0,245.0,Subject,"Yeah. You should do it. One time, don't do it for the whole [afternoon?]. [laughter]"
245.0,248.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. If I did it [inaudible], that'd be a little excessive."
248.0,251.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
251.0,254.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Well, what type of music do you guys play again? Sorry, I'm just curious."
254.0,262.0,Subject,It's rock music with a little electronic stuff. We're called The Acute. I'll send you an article or something.
262.0,271.0,Interviewer,"Wow, cool. Wow. So music, tennis, research, studies, [laughter] what else is going on?"
271.0,305.0,Subject,"A lot of that. I don't know. I'm supposed to help a friend. She's 85. She's a famous first-wave feminist. She's in a nursing home. And she wrote this manuscript, and it's way too long. And she wants me to not copy and paste a Word document but literally copy and paste--"
305.0,307.0,Interviewer,"Oh, [laughter] wow."
307.0,318.0,Subject,--her manuscript into something - I donâ€™t know what the word is - more relatable for the average Joe. But I don't know if I [inaudible].
318.0,323.0,Interviewer,Like scissors and glue? [laughter]
323.0,326.0,Subject,Scissors and glue. And it's 300 pages long.
326.0,328.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh.
328.0,328.75,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
328.75,329.0,Interviewer,I was like [crosstalk]--
329.0,373.0,Subject,"Of course, she had to get in a huge fight with her writing partner. So yeah, people make demands, but we'll see. I don't have any glue sticks here, but. [laughter] Yeah. I actually have to put up some posters for some-- I got a couple of gigs just putting up posters in the East Village, so. I have to do that today. I'm going to get my poster game on. The printout, I have to do a little haggling. I'm kind of gigging and doing stuff."
373.0,377.0,Interviewer,Do you like having all these kind of smaller projects and keeping yourself [occupied?]?
377.0,415.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Because I think just mentally, doing the same thing over and over again can be really draining. Even with the tennis, it's the same kind of thing, but I'd have to show up and meet new people. It's not the same people every damn day. So it's working out good. It's okay. I'm still pretty new at it, though. I haven't done it too many times. So we'll see if it holds, a good feeling."
415.0,426.0,Interviewer,"Do you feel like, the small projects and doing these types of things, it's important to you that you have this type of diversity in your day-to-day experiences?"
426.0,468.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Having worked one nine-to-five-ish on Wall Street-- I wouldn't say Wall Street but in that neighborhood, physical neighborhood, not the proverbial neighborhood. Yeah. It's a big help. And yeah, that's how I try to do things the best I can. And sometimes you get good projects. Sometimes you'll get nothing. But it's all par for the course."
468.0,472.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what was it like working the nine-to-five? I'm so curious.
472.0,497.0,Subject,"Oh God, I didn't know that you could just leave. Right. Everyone would just up and leave, and I didn't know where they were going. But they were literally leaving, so. [laughter] It was the Toys""R""Us bankruptcy case, and I was working on the phone for the bankruptcy people. Yeah, fun."
497.0,502.0,Interviewer,"And then you would just find yourself, at 5 o'clock, in a desert of people going and--"
502.0,513.0,Subject,"Yeah. No, they would just leave, and I didn't figure it out till the last day. I tried. I finally got it too. I was like, ""Fuck this."" And then they canceled the job, but. [laughter]"
513.0,516.0,Interviewer,That's funny. They probably automated it.
516.0,520.0,Subject,"Yeah, where's everyone going type of stuff. And then they just weren't--"
520.0,521.0,Interviewer,That's [fine?].
521.0,559.0,Subject,"They weren't there. But yeah, I could-- and then I had another one that was making these insane calls to hospitals no less, being like, ""Do you have [tremedizir?] in your--"" or some drug. ""Do you have that in your--"" whatever the word is. And so I'd to be like, ""Can you connect me to the microbiology lab?"" And it made no fucking sense, honestly. It was so stupid. I don't even know what he was doing, the guy. But I was making 35--"
559.0,563.0,Interviewer,And the point was-- was it poisonous? What was the reason why he wanted to know?
563.0,570.0,Subject,"No. He wanted to know who had what drugs where. Yeah, whatever."
570.0,572.0,Interviewer,Like an inventory thing?
572.0,586.0,Subject,"Yeah, kind of. Because he was a consultant. So he was doing some consulting for, I guess, somebody that would've wanted that information, so. [laughter] It's so weird. Yeah."
586.0,588.0,Interviewer,Is it doing more [crosstalk]?
588.0,596.0,Subject,"And then somehow, I wasn't good enough for that, so that was a big surprise. Not really, but it was okay."
596.0,600.0,Interviewer,"Wait, that is a surprise. I feel like you would be very personable on the phone."
600.0,607.0,Subject,Yeah. But you're just on hold. You know how hospitals are. You work at Mount Sinai.
607.0,609.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, you're just on hold. Yeah. I know."
609.0,609.75,Subject,Yeah. I don't know.
609.75,610.0,Interviewer,They just bounce [crosstalk].
610.0,619.0,Subject,"I'm sure at Mount Sinai, they don't put you through that because they've got standards. But these are hospitals all over the country."
619.0,623.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. They do [seem to?]-- they just bounce you to different departments, so it's like--"
623.0,625.0,Subject,"Yeah, exactly."
625.0,631.0,Interviewer,"""So these people can help you out. Let me connect you."" ""Oh, no. These people can help you out. Let me connect you."""
631.0,636.0,Subject,"Yeah. And then, yeah, they'll just throw you back and forth."
636.0,637.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
637.0,643.0,Subject,"Yeah. Because working in a hospital is hard. I mean, I'm sure."
643.0,645.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. There's definitely a lot of work to be done, I think."
645.0,648.0,Subject,It seems hard. [laughter]
648.0,661.0,Interviewer,I think everyone has just a lot on their plate all the time. I think the [type?] of work is so grueling. It's more that just everyone is dealing with maybe just a little bit more than they have bandwidth for.
661.0,664.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That sounds about right."
664.0,671.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So this research gig situation, has that been proving fun or interesting, or?"
671.0,685.0,Subject,"Oh, that's over now. That was a couple of months ago. It was kind of interesting. But then it kind of wasn't. But then it ended right on time, so."
685.0,691.0,Interviewer,"And have you been participating in other studies besides this one, or is this the main one that you--?"
691.0,776.0,Subject,"I don't know. What else have I done? Yeah. I did a tobacco study. Oh, I worked at Irving Plaza on some corporate fucking event. So I was just like a PA, getting coffee and stuff. Yeah, well-paid, good, long days setting up stages. But they had real pros there. They had a guy from NBC who was like, ""Yesterday, I just sent a mix. It's hard-knock life for six hours."" He's behind the dials at NBC. He's like, ""Do it again."" So yeah, they were real pros. It's good to meet-- yeah. But he didn't seem too happy. I wonder if he has exploded yet or not. He was having a tough time. Yeah. That was around Christmas. It was the JPMorgan Chase Christmas pageant or whatever. But I got my name in the door at Irving Plaza, which was recommended. Yeah. I'm trying to think. There's got to be other--"
776.0,780.0,Interviewer,"What was that recommended for, though, getting your name in the door?"
780.0,794.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. No. I just thought getting to know people there, a big venue around here, was a good idea. Yeah."
794.0,800.0,Interviewer,"Just networking, generally. It sounds like you have the ability to network with a lot of different types of people in all these--"
800.0,808.0,Subject,"Yeah, hopefully. We'll see. I'll let you be the judge of that in your [study?]."
808.0,819.0,Interviewer,"I mean, yeah, it sounds like it. So you do want to ever go back to that type of-- because I feel like the people that you're networking probably are doing more than the standard nine-to-five. But is that [something that?]--"
819.0,863.0,Subject,"Yeah. They're the hired at that-- those are just hired, the people that do the sound and the lights for Broadway and stuff. I have some audiovisual tech skills but not a million of them. So definitely, it was good to get that together. Because often, it has a big impact on how things go if you know what you're doing or not, I guess."
863.0,870.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, definitely. And is there an opportunity to maybe shadow people who have been doing that already or who--?"
870.0,890.0,Subject,"Yeah, there was. There was a little opportunity. But yeah, I was a little more, I guess, reserved. I didn't do that so much, but that's okay."
890.0,893.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. There's always time, right?"
893.0,894.0,Subject,Yeah.
894.0,900.0,Interviewer,"So if you are interested, I can always let you know as other studies come up if you want to participate in other ones because--"
900.0,910.0,Subject,"Definitely. I was told by the EEG guy that he had one for me, but they never came through, and I was heartbroken."
910.0,912.0,Interviewer,"Well, I can connect you with them, actually. So why don't I do that after this call?"
912.0,913.0,Subject,"Oh, good. Oh, thank you. Thank you."
913.0,920.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I know the person who runs that. And so I'll just set up a little email with you and introduce you guys.
920.0,929.0,Subject,"Yeah. I've got some time during the day for as many as you got, so."
929.0,946.0,Interviewer,"Okay, sounds good. I'll let you know. Okay. So we talked about some of the job situation, some hobby stuff. What about on the friend side, social side? Are there any things that you like to do or that you've been trying, or?"
946.0,993.0,Subject,"You got me there. I don't know. I don't know. It's kind of weather-dependent. I don't really fixate on things that I really want to do socially so much, or I don't really plan, at least not right now. I haven't really been planning things. I've just been - I don't know - sort of just focusing on what I'm doing and letting all that stuff take care of itself."
993.0,997.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It sounds like [you have?] kind of a social outlook in some ways.
997.0,1046.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah. Not right now because we're just finishing up some work that mainly takes place here. But yeah, obviously, that's a big element of what I'm up to, and it involves socializing, sometimes too much so because that's how it goes. Yeah. It's really nice out now. I'm kind of in the mood to be more social and active. I don't know. I'm sort of seasonal, I guess, in that way. I just kind of curl up for a couple of months, come back to life when necessary."
1046.0,1057.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I think a lot of people are like that. I think it's so hard to rally yourself to do all of these extraneous activities when it's just [inaudible] outside.
1057.0,1074.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's been pretty rough. Yeah. The timing is all working out right, so it's a good patch to start talking to people again, I guess."
1074.0,1086.0,Interviewer,"It would be funny to do a study about the difference if you moved a New Yorker to Florida during the winter. Their social life would improve, right?"
1086.0,1092.0,Subject,"Wow, yeah, some [inaudible] disorder, that's the best thing for me. I need to--"
1092.0,1094.0,Interviewer,"And it's already been done, yeah."
1094.0,1100.0,Subject,Yeah. I'm sure you could-- I'm sure you've got a good database over there. I don't know what the hell you're doing.
1100.0,1109.0,Interviewer,All those studies are always using those UV lamps. But they don't actually [laughter] transport people to Florida. I think that might be a different experience.
1109.0,1124.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah. You've got the budget. [laughter] You've got to use it. You can't be taking all those kickbacks. [laughter] I'm just making some coffee.
1124.0,1127.0,Interviewer,All right. So--
1127.0,1130.0,Subject,"Oh, I've been trying to take more matcha and less coffee because coffee--"
1130.0,1132.0,Interviewer,[There you go?].
1132.0,1139.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's going well, except right now I'm making coffee. [laughter]  Other than that, it's going great. I'm really--"
1139.0,1142.0,Interviewer,Has that helped how you felt?
1142.0,1161.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's good. It really is. I think sometimes after I eat, I get really lethargic. And then I smoke pot, and then that would make it worse. So I'm trying to just mitigate that a little bit."
1161.0,1165.0,Interviewer,And do you feel like [being played?] into that?
1165.0,1174.75,Subject,I don't know. I don't know. But I know that something is working better. There's just something that's not as horrible.
1174.75,1175.0,Interviewer,And so why-?
1175.0,1186.0,Subject,"When I eat and then I get tired, then I feel both stupid and useless, so. [laughter]"
1186.0,1192.0,Interviewer,"But coffee, usually, I feel like, makes you have more energy. So is the matcha kind of taking over [crosstalk]--?"
1192.0,1221.0,Subject,"It's a more relaxed sort of coffee-ish experience. It's not as hyper. I've done some research on it. And caffeine, that's another-- I'm sure there are a million coffee studies. But yeah, it's got a lot of-- there's a weird serotonin flushing."
1221.0,1224.0,Interviewer,"Oh, after you have coffee?"
1224.0,1238.0,Subject,Yeah. There's some weird stuff. Hold on. I don't know who that is. We will see. [laughter] Hang on. Okay.
1238.0,1241.0,Interviewer,"At least you're on video. In case it's anyone you don't know, we'll [cut it?]."
1241.0,1249.0,Subject,Right. [laughter] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can direct me to the right unit at the hospital too.
1249.0,1272.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my. Yeah. So I've been hearing a lot about this matcha caffeine switch. But I've also been seeing some funny memes on Instagram and other social media where they say, ""Oh, if you switch out your matcha for--"" sorry, ""If you switch out your coffee for matcha, you can lose 80% of your happiness in life,"" or whatever."
1272.0,1283.0,Subject,"Oh God, no, you have to do your research. That's all I'm going to say. Do your own research, I'd say. Yeah. No, it's--"
1283.0,1290.0,Interviewer,"I mean, I'm sure-- are you one of those people who drink coffee for the taste or more for the effect that it had on you?"
1290.0,1321.0,Subject,"Actually, I was telling Cheyenne this. When I was in high school, I would have major panic attacks because I would drink, mad sugary, those Starbucks Frappuccinos. I was addicted. They had them at the cafeteria. And I got into TicTacs. I have a bit of an addictive personality. So I'm trying to find the right answers to these difficult--"
1321.0,1322.0,Interviewer,Salad. [laughter]
1322.0,1323.0,Subject,"Yeah, exactly."
1323.0,1326.0,Interviewer,Vegetables.
1326.0,1335.0,Subject,That's another option. Now you're getting all-- now you're getting all heady. [laughter]
1335.0,1351.0,Interviewer,"Oh, yeah. I think that everybody, to some extent, has their own ways of dealing with stress. And I think that a lot of addiction or addictive personality tendencies often come as a result of like, ""Oh, I'm in a [difficult?] situation. What do I do?"" or, ""Oh, I want to--"""
1351.0,1354.0,Subject,Exactly. Exactly.
1354.0,1359.0,Interviewer,"""--get rid of this uncomfortable feeling that I have. How do I get through it?"" And so I think--"
1359.0,1375.0,Subject,"I think you're absolutely right. Yeah. Yeah. And it's helping me to know that, and that's helpful. So thanks. Doing two jobs at once here. [laughter]"
1375.0,1407.0,Interviewer,"I wish that if you-- something that I've thought about, at least for myself, is that if I realize that-- as just a way of handling an uncomfortable situation, I can actually say to myself, ""Okay. Well, I'm actually not unbearably uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable, but I could sit with the discomfort for a little longer."" And I think the more comfortable you get with sitting with a maybe less than pleasant situation, the less maybe the urge would be to fill the void in some way."
1407.0,1424.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. And sort of, yeah, just managing those mental pathways and stuff and, yeah, being aware of them, right? But they're not easy to break, some of them."
1424.0,1430.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you feel like you're somebody who thinks a lot about the way that you think? Are you one of those people who--?
1430.0,1442.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm pretty analytical about what I'm doing. Because I work in a creative field, I can actually--"
1442.0,1444.0,Interviewer,Sorry about that. That was really loud.
1444.0,1458.0,Subject,"You're all good. I've heard worse. But yeah, I try to be analytical in that way, yeah, generally."
1458.0,1469.0,Interviewer,"And do you feel like people who you might go to or talk to in situations of discomfort are kind of equally analytical of the situation, or is that more of a you thing?"
1469.0,1501.0,Subject,"I don't know. I try to talk to people who kind of see the way things similar to the way I do, so. But you can only really analyze yourself from an internal perspective. It's hard to relate everything to somebody else, although you can give them generally what's going on. "
1501.0,1505.0,Interviewer,And do you find it helpful to kind of try to explain to other people?
1505.0,1523.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, every once in a while, not every day. I'm pretty guarded in that way because you can't be telling everyone everything. Yeah. Yeah."
1523.0,1532.0,Interviewer,"Do you feel like you've had bad experiences with telling people something and having it kind of come out the wrong way or having someone misinterpret it, or?"
1532.0,1558.0,Subject,"I don't know. I've kind of gone through a lot of friends. I've had a lot of friends. And then for whatever reason, it sort of petered out, so I'm trying to be more careful about who I associate with, you might say, not in a specific way, just more generally."
1558.0,1569.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I know you're saying it's not too specific, but have you found any patterns in terms of some traits that you tend to like in people that you keep around?"
1569.0,1608.0,Subject,"I think being kind of analytical is definitely up my alley and not being too-- it's hard to explain. But yeah, yeah, I think I've found-- it's hard to describe it, but I do think I found a tight sort of person. I don't know. It gets pretty heady. [laughter] I don't know how to-- yeah."
1608.0,1626.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It's interesting. I just think it's so interesting to think about when sometimes you can think about friends and being kind of separate in certain ways. You met this one through music or this one through work. But then if you ever got them all together, I wonder how similar they might be or not."
1626.0,1639.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm sure I have gotten them all together, and no one gets along. [laughter] It doesn't matter. But that's cool. People don't all have to get along."
1639.0,1641.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, definitely not, definitely not."
1641.0,1647.0,Subject,"Yeah, just most of us. [laughter]"
1647.0,1651.0,Interviewer,Just the ones that you keep around you have [crosstalk] you.
1651.0,1654.0,Subject,Yeah. That's a lot of it for sure.
