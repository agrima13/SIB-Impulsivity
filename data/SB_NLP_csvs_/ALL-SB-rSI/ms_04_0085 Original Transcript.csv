2.0,7.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
7.0,16.0,Subject,Things have been fine. Everything is normal. Yeah. Nothing out of the ordinary.
16.0,21.0,Interviewer,So what's normal and ordinary for you look like?
21.0,67.0,Subject,"Ever since I left my job, I've just been spending more time at home. Reading a lot more. Yeah. I've been inside a lot. Yeah. [Normalizing?]. There's been no change in my routine. I still get up. Do yoga. Breakfast. And after that, really, I don't have anything planned for the day. So whatever."
67.0,73.0,Interviewer,Nice. So what types of stuff have you been reading lately?
73.0,113.0,Subject,"I've been rereading a book of mine. 1984 by George Orwell. My third time reading it. Yeah. I was going through this phase where I was reading, like, five books at a time. So I had to pick one and complete that, and then move on to the next one because it's hard to pick up where you left off when you have five different things. So I decided to just stick to one to make it easier."
113.0,121.0,Interviewer,"And how has that been now, switching to one? What is your experience like and how is it different?"
121.0,156.0,Subject,"It's much easier. It's much easier because, yeah, picking up where I left off doesn't require me to reread an entire chapter to catch up. I already kind of know where I am. What was the question again? Sorry."
156.0,164.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Just how has that been different, your experience now that you're reading one book at a time?"
164.0,178.0,Subject,"I mean, I think that's something a normal person would do. Read one book at a time. It's been all right. It's normal."
178.0,183.0,Interviewer,And so what went into the idea of reading five at a time?
183.0,213.0,Subject,"Because I bought, like, five different books, and I was curious to read all of them-- read bits of all them, and I was kind of putting myself under pressure because I have, like, 10 books that I own now, and I would like to get through all of them, but it takes time. I'm almost done with this one, so yeah."
213.0,231.0,Interviewer,That's so exciting. That's so great that you kind of dove into that. So yoga. Is that also something that you've just recently kind of dove into as a result of your new situation of not being at your old job?
231.0,273.0,Subject,"No. Yoga was part of the routine for a while. Ever since I was doing landscaping I kind of understood the importance of stretching before work. And yeah, having a job that was physically strenuous, it helped me become more intimate, I would say, with my yoga. Really helps. But yeah, it's been part of my routine for awhile."
273.0,282.0,Interviewer,"So what does that mean for you, that it helped your yoga become more intimate and your practice become more intimate?"
282.0,345.0,Subject,"So with the job I would feel aches and I would be sore. So the stretches. I spend more time in one pose, and I try to reach my limit in terms of how far I can stretch and for how long. I focus on parts of the body I don't usually focus on. And yeah, it's a good physical exercise to get you-- I'm trying to think of the word, but it kind of gets you familiar with how your body is. I don't think a lot of people are that in touch with their body to be honest."
345.0,367.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's so true and interesting. Yeah. So besides these physical sensations and kind of working on stretching different types of muscles and being in tune with your body, was there any other mental or spiritual component to your yoga practice?"
367.0,468.0,Subject,"I like to use crystals. A lot of people have this notion that crystal comes with inherent power, and when they get one, they're disappointed that it doesn't have any effects, but I try to explain to people the way I use it, it's like an aid. It's a way for me to, I guess, regulate my energy. The energy that the crystal has, it's a projection of what you program into it. So it's a reflection of what you really put into it. The same way a dollar bill has some sort of value. It's a physical object, and it's really a piece of paper, but because everyone agrees that it has value to it, it makes it easier. So I use crystals. At the end of-- at the beginning and at the end of each session I bow as a way to show respect to myself. I give myself credit at the end because no one else is going to do that for me. So I have to appreciate the work that I'm putting in to better myself. So yeah."
468.0,487.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Absolutely. And can you just tell me a little bit more about how it is that you channel your energy and your intention or whatever it is that you're trying to reflect in the crystal? What that process looks like for you.
487.0,563.0,Subject,"Well, I have a book. It's called the Crystal Bible. It's basically a crystal dictionary. It shows you each crystal, and it describes its purpose. And usually when I get a new one-- or before I get it I read about it. Read what it's good for. You buy it, and it teaches you how to program it. So they say that you hold it in your hand and you analyze it and you do a deep analyzation of the crystal. And yeah, it kind of helps with the programing. Since I've already read what it's for, it's easy to kind of program it to kind of program it into the crystal. So yeah, that's what I do. And then I use it for meditation and my yoga stretches. Yeah."
563.0,595.0,Interviewer,So it sounds like the crystal has inherent properties that you can learn about and read about. And then you kind of channel those properties when you're programing it into the crystal. And then the crystal kind of gives back. So is it almost like a cycle in that way? That it has its own properties. You insert your own programing based on what the crystal's inherently supposed to have. And then that kind of feeds back into your practice. Or is that not a good--
595.0,653.0,Subject,"Yeah. That sounds right. Yeah. That sounds pretty right. I've had someone come up to me one time because I was wearing a pendant, and this guy from some church, he was trying to get me to go into the church. And for some reason he was trying to compare the relationship people have with God to the relationship people have with crystal, and he was like, ""Oh, with the crystal, isn't the way it works is that you make a wish? You make a wish so that it can come true."" And I said, ""No. It doesn't work like that."" But yeah, it was some guy trying to get me to get into the church. But yeah, that was pretty accurate, how he put it."
653.0,670.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Cool. Do you think that that's how it works with God? That if you make a wish, then God will-- do you have any feelings about the distinction between the crystal and God?"
670.0,772.0,Subject,"I'm not religious, but when I think of God, I don't really-- when I think of God, I don't think of it as having a physical appearance because when I was studying philosophy in school, we would study-- I think it was Descartes. Someone. And they would say that-- maybe Aquinas. I don't remember, but they would say that God is-- basically, God is so great that we can't reduce it in terms of how we think about it. So every time I think of God, I just think of space because there's really no way I can quantify what that is. I feel like God is kind of a word that people use to kind of reduce existence, I guess. That's how they try to make sense of it. But I don't really think of God in a religious sense. I don't think about that too much."
772.0,787.0,Interviewer,"So you believe that a god exists, but you don't think of it in a religious context, or what is it that you-- how do you perceive God in respect to your day-to-day life or your world?"
787.0,817.75,Subject,"I'm not the type to wake and thank God, but I do think that there is a power much larger than I can understand. I do agree with that. A person with a white beard and robe on, it seems too ridiculous for me to get into."
817.75,818.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That makes--
818.0,822.0,Subject,And yeah.
822.0,853.0,Interviewer,"And is anybody else in your immediate circle, whether it's family or friends, kind of involved at all in your spiritual practices or beliefs, or is this something more that you've been curating on your own as you go? What have you kind of incorporated into your current spiritual understanding?"
853.0,855.0,Subject,Can you ask that again?
855.0,872.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Sorry. That was a long question. Basically, you've been reading a lot. You do yoga. Have there been any other influences in your life that have contributed to your current kind of spiritual understanding?"
872.0,966.0,Subject,"Just living. I learn through experiences. I really do believe that we have a spirit. Not in the sense that-- I guess when people think of a spirit they think of this ghost that comes out of your body, but the spirit from how I understand it, it's a manifestation of yourself, but it all comes from the mind. Everything we experience is in the mind. So I do think that the mind kind of manifested a spirit that kind of captures your essence. Your personalities, your impulses, and things of that nature, but not in a supernatural sense. It's more feasible in that sense. It comes from the mind, all [of that?]. Yeah."
966.0,993.0,Interviewer,"And so does that relate to your kind of curation of your mind in any way? Because whether it's with the reading or with yoga, it seems that you are in some ways kind of curating and cultivating the strength of your mind. Does that relate at all to what you're just saying in terms of how you conceptualize the spirit?"
993.0,995.0,Subject,Can you simplify that question?
995.0,996.0,Interviewer,Sorry.
996.0,997.0,Subject,I just woke up. Yeah. I'm sorry.
997.0,1025.0,Interviewer,"No, no, no, no. This is my fault. I'm just thinking a lot. And so it's coming out at once. So you're mentioning that for you, the spirit is something that's kind of derived from the mind. So I'm wondering if that belief plays into why you do a lot of reading and yoga because that helps you work on the strength of your mind. Is that related at all?"
1025.0,1069.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. With me, it's all about balance. I like to have everything structured and balanced because I want to achieve balance in my physical, mental, my spiritual state. And that's how I feel like I could operate at my best. If I have all three of those. Yeah. I'd balance the level. So that's what I'm working on."
1069.0,1082.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And is that balance something that you're looking to find in maybe some future job or school? Does that play into your kind of career goals at all?
1082.0,1171.0,Subject,"Yeah. It does. Talking about the landscaping job. It required not too much thought, but a lot of physical energy, which is-- it's more than I can afford. I do love the job. I do enjoy it, but physically it didn't agree with me. So I had to leave it behind. I hope to pursue a job that's a bit more intellectual, I would say. Probably as a professor or as a journalist. Yeah. Because a job that's too physically demanding-- it's not only that I can't afford it. It's just I like to use my brain more. I want to utilize my brain as well. So I wouldn't mind revising documents and writing essays. Things like that. I wouldn't mind doing that for a career."
1171.0,1191.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So in thinking about the difference between becoming a journalist and becoming a professor, why are those two the ones that you're interested in, and maybe what similarities do you see between them?"
1191.0,1273.0,Subject,"Well, with the professor, people tell that I'm good at articulating my thoughts and that I help them understand things better. And I just feel like I can help a lot of people just learn things. I think I'd be-- I'm sure I'd be good at teaching them things. And yeah, a lot of people always tell me that I have those qualities. In terms of journalism, I don't know. I just like to understand why things are the way they are. I like to get a different perspective on things. I just like to address problems that people aren't really addressing. Yeah. Yeah. I'll figure it out when I'm back at school. Yeah. That's really where my mind is at the moment."
1273.0,1282.0,Interviewer,So you mentioned that you're going back to school. Is that in preparation for one of these two paths in some ways?
1282.0,1283.75,Subject,Yeah. Yes.
1283.75,1284.0,Interviewer,So--
1284.0,1287.0,Subject,I'm going back. Yeah.
1287.0,1289.0,Interviewer,"No. Sorry, sorry. I interrupted you."
1289.0,1304.0,Subject,I'm going back to BCC to finish my associate's. Then I'm going over to a four-year school to get my master's. Yeah. That's the plan.
1304.0,1309.0,Interviewer,That's huge. That's huge. Congrats. That's exciting.
1309.0,1311.0,Subject,Yeah. Thank you. Great.
1311.0,1329.0,Interviewer,"And so is the whole finishing the associate's degree portion more to help you determine what you want to do your master's in, or do you already know what path you want to go for the master's?"
1329.0,1333.75,Subject,Could you ask the first part of the question again?
1333.75,1334.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So--
1334.0,1335.0,Subject,I'm sorry.
1335.0,1351.0,Interviewer,"No, no, no. This is my fault again. But is the associate's degree portion to help you figure out what you want to do in your master's degree later on? Or do you already know going in what you want to do your master's on?"
1351.0,1433.0,Subject,"I already know what it is. I'm going to pursue English as well. Yeah. Just learn as much as I can. That's really what I want to do. When I went to school-- when I first went to college almost five years ago, I kind of went on a whim. I didn't really understand why I was there. So I didn't take it as serious as I should have, and it caused me to drop out eventually and start working jobs that I didn't really like. And in the few years that I spent working, I was also working on myself, trying to focus on what it is that I want, and molding myself to be the person that's capable of achieving it. If that makes sense. So that's what I've been doing, and I feel ready for school."
1433.0,1452.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Not that my input matters, but it seems like you're ready to me as well. And what were some of the changes that you felt like were key to feeling prepared that you wanted yourself to develop?"
1452.0,1532.0,Subject,"Healthier habits. I had to cut out some unhealthy habits that I was indulging in. A more balanced lifestyle. Yeah. Cutting out the things that didn't favor me. In terms of food, junk food, fast food. Smoking. It was a bad habit of mine that I cut out. Yeah. Having an intention behind what I'm doing. If I decide to go out, I should have a reason to go outside. Whether it be for a walk or going out to the movies. Exercising more. Stretching more. Reading more. Writing more. Yeah. Yeah."
1532.0,1546.0,Interviewer,"That's a ton. That's a ton of changes. Wow. So what was that like for you, to be cutting out-- especially those bad habits? What was that process like for you?"
1546.0,1548.0,Subject,It was pretty easy.
1548.0,1550.0,Interviewer,Really?
1550.0,1660.0,Subject,"It was pretty easy. Yeah. It was. With me it's-- I'm trying to figure out how to say it, but let's say I've been impulsively spending for 10 days, and on the 11th day, I've incurred a lot of debt. That's when I think to myself, ""Okay. Maybe I should change it."" I always wait till things get to the extreme before I realize that I have to change, which makes it easy because recovering from an extreme situation, you'll see results pretty quickly. So that's how I've been, always. When I was smoking excessively, it was having a bad effect on my mental health. So it took me until I started hearing voices to stop. Physically, for me to start being more consistent with my stretching and exercising, it took me until I injured my spine. That's something I do want to change. I don't want to wait until it gets worse-- until it gets to a worse point. But yeah, it's pretty easy to cut out the things that don't suit me."
1660.0,1694.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It's such an interesting take, I think. Just that when you get to that point and you make that decision because you can see change so readily, that that's a motivating factor to continue doing that. That's so interesting. What was it like for you when you were in that period where you were smoking, and it got to the point where you were hearing voices? What type of headspace were you in at that point that really jolted you into changing?"
1694.0,1796.0,Subject,"I was under a lot of stress at the time. Very depressed. And when I started hearing the voices, I kind of figured-- I said, ""Yeah. I finally lost my mind,"" when I started hearing them. I told myself, like, ""I finally did it. I finally messed up."" And so I didn't want to make it worse than it already was, and I felt like I owed it to myself to recover from that situation. So I kind of put some-- I had some faith in myself to correct myself. I felt like I owed it to myself to do that. It truly helped. It helped. It still helps today. There are days where I wake up and I feel like-- and I feel like I may not be capable of doing something. But then I always remember who I am. I know I'm capable. It's just I don't know why I keep telling myself that. It's weird."
1796.0,1826.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you think that-- I'm just thinking again about this whole cultivating of the mind and working on your mind strength. Do you think that that would be helpful to other people who are in situations where they're hearing voices and having feelings like their mind is out of their own control? Do you think that that's a practice that other people could benefit from incorporating when they're in that position?
1826.0,1885.0,Subject,"I do think so. Yeah. Speaking from my position, in that situation it feels like your mind really isn't your own. It feels like you've lost control of it. So that mental exercise kind of-- it builds that strength to where you can kind of hold the reins on your own mind to regain that control over it. Yeah. It's kind of like bringing the pieces together instead of letting it stray. I do think it would help, but it's really hard when you're in that mental state. I know how it is. It's really difficult, but I do think it would help."
1885.0,1897.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. That's so interesting. I wonder if there is some way to incorporate that into - I don't know - peoples practice and daily routine.
1897.0,1903.0,Subject,"It would help. Yeah. I don't know. People seem to be focused on other things though, so."
1903.0,1909.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's for sure. Well, I don't want to take too much of your time. So if it's okay I'll stop the recording."
