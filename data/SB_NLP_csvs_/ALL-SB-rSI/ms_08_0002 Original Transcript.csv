0.0,24.0,Interviewer,"Okay, so as I said, this part of the study is audio-recorded. And then later the recording of our conversation will get turned into text, and so computers will analyze our conversation. And the point of this part of the study, Yvonne, is just to get to know you a little bit and to understand what it's like to be you."
24.0,25.0,Subject,Okay. Awesome.
25.0,29.0,Interviewer,So how would you say things have been going for you lately?
29.0,77.0,Subject,"Lately, I've been learning a whole bunch lately. I feel like I have been growing intellectually, spiritually, becoming more emotionally intelligent, too. Understanding how to cope with emotions and kind of undoing misconceptions I'd learned in the past growing up. Like things people taught me. I was brainwashed to believe so many things that just aren't true, specifically about faith and the Catholic Church and things like that. So that's where I'm at. I'm just learning a lot these days."
77.0,83.0,Interviewer,Cool. So you feel like you've been making changes to how you think about the Catholic Church?
83.0,90.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. And just God in general. Just God as a whole.
90.0,95.0,Interviewer,"Like a spiritual journey that you've started recently, you think?"
95.0,111.0,Subject,"I've been on this journey for years. Literally since I was a teenager, but now it's at its peak. Because, I'm, like I said, becoming more intellectually aware and reading a lot and stuff."
111.0,113.0,Interviewer,You feel like you're on a journey that's at its peak right now?
113.0,115.0,Subject,Yeah.
115.0,118.0,Interviewer,Wow. What's that like [laughter]? Sounds exciting.
118.0,154.0,Subject,"It is. It's really cool. It's just understanding that God is love and that His mercy is infinite toward all creation, not just a select few. And that life is good and it's a blessing to be alive."
154.0,161.0,Interviewer,"Wow. That's really wonderful [laughter]. So it's been going on since you were a teenager, this journey?"
161.0,214.0,Subject,"It started, yeah, because I was brought up in the Catholic Church. My parents are Catholic. I attended Sunday School for a long time, but as I got into the teenage years, I started experimenting with-- not experimenting with, but just associating with people that necessarily weren't very good for me, didn't have my best interests at heart. So they would kind of drag me along. And I was very easily influenced at that time. Just absorbing whatever was around me. Getting involved with just the wrong kind of people. So after going through that, I can look back now, reflect, ""Okay, that wasn't necessarily the best thing I could have done in that situation"" kind of thing."
214.0,216.0,Interviewer,"So you've been reflecting about the past, like we do?"
216.0,291.0,Subject,"Yeah, I'm always reflecting. I'm super pensive. I love to think. Just be introspective, my own head. For me prayer is all about that, just communicating your soul to the Creator. And I've come to appreciate just spirituality, all kinds. Because something the Catholic Church teaches is that God is in all things, so it's not this closed-off thing. It's like, ""No, if you look at all religions, what do they all have in common?"" They have a lot in common, right? They all have the Golden Rule message, that treat others the way you want to be treated, spread peace. Love is the central message, I think, in all religions. So that right there is a testament to just truth."
291.0,299.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So you've been thinking a lot about all religions, too?"
299.0,300.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
300.0,302.0,Interviewer,Cool.
302.0,364.0,Subject,"And understanding how my own spiritual needs are met in the Catholic Church. I'm a very visual person, so the architecture really sets my mind up for prayer. Seeing all the colors and icons, the incense that they burn, that smell, I love smells. The senses are just really stimulated. Receiving the body and blood of Christ. So as Catholics we believe that when the priest is saying the words that Jesus said, in that right moment, the wafer and the wine is converted to the very body and blood of Christ. So to receive that sacrament-- it's called a sacrament-- everything is just helpful."
364.0,369.0,Interviewer,Everything's helpful. What do you mean by that?
369.0,400.0,Subject,"Everything that spikes my senses-- incense, the art, the prayers, the environment. Yeah, it just is very important for me. Especially having this disorder, it keeps me grounded. And it gives me something to hold onto and to live for."
400.0,411.0,Interviewer,"That's wonderful. Sounds like a really great inner journey that you've been on in the last couple years, has it been?"
411.0,440.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, for sure. And I was even thinking about how the psychosis episodes, how they were so spiritual. It was just intense. Every single one of them, it just feels like there's a battle between-- just like a spiritual warfare of some sort. It's really intense."
440.0,442.0,Interviewer,What was it like?
442.0,506.0,Subject,"Psychosis? It was like there was a force that was just-- like a very strong negative force, just trying to-- just scary. Made me paranoid. I felt like I was being personally attacked. And I understand that to be-- and in going through this I understand we're in a spiritual battle. We're physical and spiritual beings, so there is something more than what we can see happening. I can't understand everything, because I don't know, but I do know for sure that there is something else that I'm not aware of, that we can't physically see."
506.0,508.0,Interviewer,There's something else?
508.0,539.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. And it's just really interesting to look at the science, too. Because science and spirituality, they go hand in hand. That's something I learned, too. Before I thought it just, pick one and ditch the other. But no, they're both-- they complement each other. That goes to the teaching of faith and reason. They're both together. They coincide."
539.0,551.0,Interviewer,"Definitely. So that's something you've been thinking about as part of this journey, too?"
551.0,565.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. And for a while, it was like I was traumatized going through that. Because it was just so scary."
565.0,567.0,Interviewer,Through the psychosis?
567.0,577.0,Subject,I honestly I don't know how I overcame that. It was a miracle. Because it was so scary.
577.0,580.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What was scary about it?
580.0,604.0,Subject,"You just don't know what's going on. It feels like you're not even in control of anything. So much is happening at once and it's overwhelming. You just don't know what to do about it. You don't understand what's happening to you. It's like you're almost dying, in a way."
604.0,606.0,Interviewer,Sounds really scary.
606.0,630.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. It is. It's like your brain is out of control. It's not stable. And that's why I needed to take some medications to help [laughter] with that.
630.0,631.0,Interviewer,Do you feel like it helped?
631.0,647.0,Subject,The risperidone? Yeah. Yeah. I think everything served its purpose during the time I needed it. But I feel like now I'm in a better place so I don't have to rely on it so much.
647.0,655.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what's it been like being in a better place? Or what makes it that way?
655.0,672.0,Subject,"Spirituality is huge, really being involved in my own spirituality. Yeah, that."
672.0,680.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, so spirituality feels like something that helps you not need medication, you're saying."
680.0,695.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. And with that comes so many other things that I would probably have to write a book about it because it's so much. Yeah. That's the life goal I have, is to write a book."
695.0,699.0,Interviewer,That's great [laughter]. That's exciting. What would you write about?
699.0,710.0,Subject,Kind of like a memoir. I don't know yet. Something cool.
710.0,714.0,Interviewer,Something cool about your life.
714.0,782.0,Subject,"Yeah, because I like to write and read. And I think it can help people. I want it to be relevant, because I know so many people can relate to me going through this. Yeah, and then coming to meet so many different kinds of people, I like to pick people's brains. So I'm aware of kind of how they think about certain things. So I understand where they're coming from. I think it's good to not neglect people's perspectives, but to listen to them. Because we all think what we think for a reason. It's not without a reason. You got any more questions?"
782.0,796.0,Interviewer,"So it sounds like you've had an exiting-- this journey you've been on, spiritual journey, the last few years. What was it like before that, before you started the journey?"
796.0,829.75,Subject,"Before the journey. All right, I can just think about my childhood, I guess. I had an awesome childhood. My parents raised me with so much love. They're so caring. They're just amazing parents. So I had no problems there. The problems started when I became a teenager, I guess."
829.75,830.0,Interviewer,The problems started?
830.0,870.0,Subject,"That's when I was-- yeah. That's when I started dealing with issues. I went through depression, really hard-core depression when I was in sixth grade. So even before being a teenager. When I was 11, I went through an emo phase. All throughout middle school, I hated it. That place was just so bad, that school. The teachers were just very authoritative and they showed no compassion. Like if we were in jail or something. It was just-- I hated it. To this day I hate that school."
870.0,872.0,Interviewer,Ugh. Sounds terrible.
872.0,892.0,Subject,"Yeah. And I remember transferring out to my other school and it was like a release. I was like, ""Wait. School can be this way?"" I was just so amazed. Because going through all that, I didn't know it could be better."
892.0,895.0,Interviewer,You didn't know it could be better when you moved middle schools?
895.0,908.0,Subject,"Yeah. In eighth grade, that's when I transferred to my middle-- it's a middle school and high school. So I completed eighth grade and then I went to straight to high school there."
908.0,910.0,Interviewer,What was it like in the new high school?
910.0,967.0,Subject,"In the new school, I saw different energy. The teachers were loving. They actually showed that they wanted to be there. It didn't feel so posed and strict. And then I also noticed how the students felt like there wasn't this anxiety, there wasn't a burden anymore. And it was just so cool to see how teachers can be cool and chill and it's not chaotic in the classroom. There's still this understanding between students and the teacher. So that chemistry between the teachers and the students, I loved it."
967.0,969.0,Interviewer,So you liked your teachers?
969.0,970.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
970.0,972.0,Interviewer,What did you like about them?
972.0,1005.0,Subject,"They were so creative. Their approach to teaching was unique. You could tell it came from their personality and that they put thought and effort into it and they weren't just trying to shove something down our throat and that's it, for a test. They were funny. They were childlike, so we could relate to them. So."
1005.0,1010.0,Interviewer,So what did you dislike about the old school?
1010.0,1039.75,Subject,"The old school? I really hated the way it was structured. It was very cultish, I would even say [laughter]. I joke about it now, but they even had a chant we would have to do every morning, a long chant. We had to memorize it. And for every class we had to chant. So--"
1039.75,1040.0,Interviewer,A chant?
1040.0,1059.75,Subject,"Yeah. Literally a chant. About the school, about what the school stands for, what our responsibilities are, as students there. The name of the school was Knowledge and Power Preparatory Academy IV."
1059.75,1060.0,Interviewer,Four.
1060.0,1069.0,Subject,IV [laughter]. Roman numerals.
1069.0,1077.0,Interviewer,Knowledge and Power Preparatory Academy.
1077.0,1098.0,Subject,"So they prided themselves a lot in how they went about things, I guess. But emotionally for the students, it was overwhelming. Being so young in that kind of environment, that can take a toll on a person."
1098.0,1099.0,Interviewer,You feel like it took a toll on you.
1099.0,1109.0,Subject,Yeah. I hated every moment there. I would cry every day.
1109.0,1116.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1116.0,1121.0,Subject,I was borderline suicidal at that point.
1121.0,1126.0,Interviewer,"Wow. That was a really bad time in your life, huh?"
1126.0,1216.0,Subject,"Yeah. It was. And now I'm just trying to understand how-- because things don't just happen like that. Having this disorder, I feel like it has its origins and as time goes on things start developing and progressively getting worse in the mind. Certain stress that is caused-- I think it's very interesting how the bipolar thing works. And then also how it ties into different personality types, as well. People that are bipolar, they have certain things that make them who they are, right? I know that we tend to be very artsy people. We're into creating art. We tend to like to read a lot. Like to learn. Our brains are just wired some kind of way. That's just a theory I have. And what I've heard, too. I watch this girl on YouTube who has bipolar and she converted to Catholicism recently. So everything she says I'm like, ""Yeah, I totally get you."" So much similarity."
1216.0,1218.0,Interviewer,You feel like you identify with her?
1218.0,1292.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. Because she breaks it down. What it's like to have mania. What it's like to have depression, the episodes. She even says in her videos when she's manic, she's like, ""Oh, I'm manic, by the way."" The way she accepts her disorder, it encourages me to accept my disorder as well. Because it's not a bad thing to be manic. I used to see things so black and white. ""If I'm manic, oh, that's bad."" Just paranoid. But she's like, ""No. Mania is awesome."" You immerse yourself into certain things and you just grab so much and you learn so much. You create. You're productive. Of course, there has to be a balance, but it's like this, so just ride the wave, I guess. Just you learn how to cope with things. Don't get into dangerous kind of situations. That awareness of your issues."
1292.0,1298.0,Interviewer,It sounds like she's made you see these things in a new light.
1298.0,1300.75,Subject,"In a new light, yeah. Definitely."
1300.75,1301.0,Interviewer,A good light.
1301.0,1305.0,Subject,Uh-huh.
1305.0,1306.0,Interviewer,That's really nice.
1306.0,1311.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
1311.0,1317.0,Interviewer,"So, Yvonne, what do you think about, as you look forward to the future?"
1317.0,1322.0,Subject,The future. Just like in general?
1322.0,1323.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1323.0,1347.0,Subject,"I love to travel. I want to go to Spain and Italy. I want to have fun. I want to be a massage therapist. I want to do so much with my life. So I'm looking forward. I want to get married, have kids."
1347.0,1348.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1348.0,1350.0,Subject,I got the names picked out and everything.
1350.0,1354.0,Interviewer,Really. Real exciting plans you have.
1354.0,1368.0,Subject,"For a girl I like Rose, or Rosemary. I love that name. Arielle. And then for boys I like John-Luke and Evan."
1368.0,1371.0,Interviewer,Cool. How'd you pick them?
1371.0,1373.0,Subject,I just like them. I don't know.
1373.0,1374.0,Interviewer,Good names.
1374.0,1382.0,Subject,Thanks.
1382.0,1385.0,Interviewer,So what do you think would be fun about traveling?
1385.0,1463.0,Subject,"Traveling. Learning different cultures. Exploring. Spontaneity. I love being spontaneous. Even when I make plans with friends, I don't like to have a certain schedule, like ""Oh we're going to do this. We're going to go here."" I'd rather say, ""Okay let's go eat somewhere,"" and then who knows? Walk around, because who knows where you'll end up, you know? You just walk. You enter a museum or something funny happens and it doesn't have to be so structured. That's what I like about the thought of traveling. That's it's just you don't know what to expect, you're just going for it. And there's always good that comes from random exploring. And then certain friends that always want to have a plan, things never go according to plan. And more times than not, you don't even-- since everything is so structured and there's such a high expectation for everything, nothing ends up happening, a lot of times. So I think it's best to just say, ""Okay, we're going to meet up."" And take it from there."
1463.0,1465.0,Interviewer,You like things to be unstructured?
1465.0,1470.0,Subject,Yeah. When it comes to fun. Because that's what fun is [laughter].
1470.0,1472.0,Interviewer,Yeah. You like the spontaneity.
1472.0,1485.0,Subject,"Uh-huh. Not to a crazy excess, like doing super illegal things. But, for the most part."
1485.0,1487.0,Interviewer,Do you feel like structure can get in the way of fun?
1487.0,1518.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. It can. But it's interesting that I like to learn about structured things like philosophy. Because these things are very laid out, but it's different because these are the things that set the tone for bigger questions. So it's kind of different, but for fun, just have fun."
1518.0,1520.0,Interviewer,"So you like to learn about philosophy, huh?"
1520.0,1521.0,Subject,Uh-huh.
1521.0,1523.0,Interviewer,Cool.
1523.0,1536.0,Subject,"I'm reading a book about this guy, St. Thomas Aquinas. Huge person in the Catholic Church."
1536.0,1537.75,Interviewer,"I'm actually reading a book about him, too."
1537.75,1538.0,Subject,No way.
1538.0,1541.0,Interviewer,Yeah [laughter]. I'll show you later.
1541.0,1543.0,Subject,That's nuts.
1543.0,1544.0,Interviewer,How is your book?
1544.0,1616.0,Subject,"It's good. It's a free e-book from this website that I got. And it's 50 pages long, so it's very short, but it's really good when you're starting to learn about this stuff. I'm reading about angels. I was reading about-- there's a mysterious hierarchy of angels. They're different ranks. There's angels that are higher in the rank. And those angels are less associated with the earthly life. Our guardian angels are at the third hierarchy, I think. And it goes into it and stuff. This is stuff I've never even learned about. There's so much to learn. I'm convinced I'll never stop learning or anything about anything. Because there's always more."
1616.0,1623.0,Interviewer,I think that's a great way to think.
1623.0,1700.0,Subject,"I'm on page 30. In the beginning of the book it talks about his life, his parents, how he was brought up, the philosophical argument that defends the position that God exists. And it compares theology with philosophy, and how they're distinct but they go hand in hand, like faith and reason. And it talks about Plato and Aristotle and all the Greek philosophers. I like it because it's sound. It makes sense. They have tons of analogies, which are great to understand things. I love analogies, so this book has a lot of those. Kind of like it makes your brain think about things in a way that's relevant and practical."
1700.0,1705.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It can help you understand complicated things. Foreign ideas.
1705.0,1716.0,Subject,Simplifies. Right.
1716.0,1717.0,Interviewer,So it's been exciting reading the book?
1717.0,1727.0,Subject,"Yeah, it has."
1727.0,1736.0,Interviewer,Have you felt like it's been a helpful thing to do as part of the spiritual journey?
1736.0,1743.0,Subject,"Absolutely, yeah."
1743.0,1747.0,Interviewer,"It's talking about questions of faith and reason, like you've been thinking about, too, right?"
1747.0,1773.0,Subject,"Right. And it might seem contradictive, but I take comfort in the fact that I don't know everything. There's comfort there. It's like a letting go of control kind of thing."
1773.0,1777.0,Interviewer,You feel comforted by letting yourself let go of control?
1777.0,1788.0,Subject,"Yeah. I was thinking about that on my way over here, actually. I even stepped in a church in St. Frances of Sales, back there--"
1788.0,1789.0,Interviewer,By the subway.
1789.0,1796.0,Subject,"Yeah, I got off the subway and I was like, ""Oh, I'm early. I'm going to go in here for some time."" I spent like 30 minutes there."
1796.0,1797.0,Interviewer,What was it like?
1797.0,1813.0,Subject,"I sat and I prayed and reflected. Told God what was on my heart, what I've been thinking about and just resting there."
1813.0,1814.0,Interviewer,Resting?
1814.0,1867.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. Then there's so many people we can learn from in church history, too. After reading about him, I want to look into the women, too. There's so many, like St. Teresa of Avila. Reading about Mary in theology, learning more about that. I wear this. This is called a miraculous medal."
1867.0,1869.0,Interviewer,Cool.
1869.0,1958.0,Subject,"And the story about this is really interesting. I recommend looking into it. Mary actually appeared to St. Catherine of Labourde, some French place, and she appeared and she presented herself in this exact way. And she told her to have this image made and distribute it to people as a way of showing the graces that she will give to those who are devoted to her. It's really cool. There's so much to say about it. I wish I could express as eloquently as it is, but I'm still learning [laughter]."
1958.0,1961.0,Interviewer,"About Thomas Aquinas, about--?"
1961.0,1963.0,Subject,"About this, the story about it."
1963.0,1964.0,Interviewer,"Oh, the story."
1964.0,2068.0,Subject,"Yeah. Because I was super against Mary and the Catholic Church in general when I was a part of this Protestant church. It's actually a cult, I'm convinced. They-- yeah, I'm not going to get into that, but... They really presented the Bible in a very constricted, a very confined kind of way. So going back to the Catholic Church was just liberating because I was presented the information in a way that is loving and merciful rather than damning and so not loving. So it's all new for me. Just seeing how graceful God is in giving us all these resources through Mary and through the studies of the saints and so much to learn. The term sola scriptura is what Protestants go by, where it's just the Bible and tradition is irrelevant. But I learned that tradition and the Bible go hand in hand, because there's a history of the Church. Things were passed down oratorically, so it was through words, right? It wasn't all written down. So tradition is valuable. I didn't think that way before."
2068.0,2069.0,Interviewer,Before you came back to the Catholic Church?
2069.0,2084.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. My parents prayed a lot for me. They would pray nonstop. I was like, ""I'm not going back."" I was convinced no way. It's not happening."
2084.0,2090.0,Interviewer,"What was that like, that time when you were in a different church?"
2090.0,2135.0,Subject,"Oh my gosh. It was so bad. It was so bad. I was so scared all the time. They think that if you're not part of their church you're in the darkness. You're not in the light. They have their own structured studies where you sit with them. They break you. They make you tell them your past, your super sinful past. And I was just living in fear, because I was not happy. I felt like I just have to be there if wanted to go to Heaven. And if I would leave I'm going to Hell. That's what they would ingrain in my mind."
2135.0,2136.0,Interviewer,Sounds scary.
2136.0,2287.0,Subject,"Yeah. A cult. There's videos you can watch about it on YouTube. It's called International Church of Christ. Church of Christ was the movement that preceeded the International Christian Church. So ICC, there was division in the church, so this guy, McKeen, decided that Church of Christ wasn't enough and that it wasn't really following scripture and all this stuff. He had his own kind of theology. So then he decided to separate and that's where the ICC came in. And they're growing really fast. Yeah. They're like all over the states and trying to plant churches in Third World countries. So. I pray for them, though, because they-- a lot of people there, they have great hearts. They genuinely want to serve and love others, but they're just going about it in a very radical, kind of legalistic way. Looking at the Bible in a very legalistic way. I've been learning about the themes of the Bible. It's literature, it's poetry, it's narratives, it's letters. All these themes are in the Bible. So you've got to consider that, too. And it's, I think, what better interpretation than the very interpretation of the Church, the Church fathers. The people that were directly with the Apostles and with Jesus. And his successors, like the Pope is a successor of Peter, the first pope. And there's so many documents and stuff, and books. And it's not as black and white as I thought it was."
2287.0,2288.0,Interviewer,You used to think it was more black and white?
2288.0,2310.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. Because that's how they taught it to me. Like this book even, like ice cream. Just ridiculous things, but they make it work."
2310.0,2321.0,Interviewer,"Well, Yvonne, is there anything else I didn't think to ask you about that is important to you, to understand what it's like to be you, that you wanted to talk about?"
2321.0,2327.0,Subject,I think we covered a good bunch.
2327.0,2328.0,Interviewer,Okay.
2328.0,2329.0,Subject,Yeah.
