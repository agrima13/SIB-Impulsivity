1.0,25.0,Interviewer,"So for this part, as I mentioned, we're going to record the conversation and that's so that we can do analyses on it later with the computers. So like I said, I just want to get to know you for this part, and I want to learn what it's like-- what your life is like [laughter]. So tell me, how have things been going for you lately?"
25.0,39.0,Subject,Everything's been going A-OK. I just want to get a job at a job program and that's mainly it. Trying to find employment and trying to make ends meet.
39.0,40.0,Interviewer,What's that been like?
40.0,56.0,Subject,"A bit hard because-- it's hard because I'm at the edge of my requirements for a GED, and I need to go back to school with stuff like that, but it's a little bit difficult, but I can make it work. And I need to stop smoking."
56.0,57.0,Interviewer,You need to stop smoking?
57.0,63.0,Subject,Yeah. Costing me too much money.
63.0,65.0,Interviewer,You say you think about going back to school?
65.0,71.0,Subject,"No. Going to GD school, get my GED."
71.0,84.0,Interviewer,That's great. Have you been thinking about doing that for awhile?
84.0,117.0,Subject,"Yeah. I've been thinking about doing it for awhile. I've been thinking about it and, hopefully, I will today when everything gets right. And, hopefully, I start on my work program, not next week but the following week, get my security license and all of that [inaudible] security. Yeah. The job program, they give it to me for free."
117.0,118.0,Interviewer,Have you done something like that before?
118.0,142.0,Subject,"Well I did it like six, seven years ago before I moved from Alabama. I was in Alabama for seven years, and not enough resources and jobs down there. It's difficult. It's hard living down there."
142.0,143.0,Interviewer,So you like it here better?
143.0,147.0,Subject,I like New York better. New York costs so much money but I like it better.
147.0,153.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It's less expensive down there?
153.0,160.0,Subject,"Less expensive and plus ain't nothing out there, they'll play me. Ain't no jobs out there. There are only factory jobs."
160.0,165.0,Interviewer,Did you do some of that stuff?
165.0,170.0,Subject,"I did it, but I feel that I couldn't grow in Alabama."
170.0,172.0,Interviewer,Does it grow?
172.0,199.0,Subject,Yeah. It's owned by-- it's only set in a little bit of programs out there in unemployment that could really make you-- a lot of property wages' too high. There's a poor state and none really out there. It is difficult but it is going to be all right.
199.0,201.0,Interviewer,"So what's it been like here so far, compared to Alabama?"
201.0,233.0,Subject,"It's been all right. I just take it, New York, you just got to wait on things to get what you want. You can't rush it but, hopefully, New York all about money and resources. If you got the right resources, you can make money in New York, you just can't rush it. I mean, then when it's on base everything first come, first serve. So you just got to schedule yourself, and schedule appointments, and keep them because New York, you got thousands of people, so you got to be sort of waiting."
233.0,234.0,Interviewer,You got to be waiting?
234.0,270.0,Subject,"Yeah. You know how New York goes. Unless you got a job already, it still has a waiting list, and you just got to manage what you've got and so thing's look up and up. Yeah. New York is way-- at least in Alabama they give you jobs pretty fast in a hurry, but New York you know you got to wait because there's millions of people in New York. You just got to keep pushing, that's all."
270.0,272.0,Interviewer,There's been more waiting in New York?
272.0,291.0,Subject,"No more waiting. I got my own room through HRA housing 2010e and that been pretty good. It's a mental health program. SUS, they gave me my own room but everything looking up. Everything is good."
291.0,293.0,Interviewer,How's that been so far?
293.0,308.0,Subject,It been positive. It been a positive experience having my own-- being more independent. I like my independence better than anything. I like being independent.
308.0,318.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's cool. Did you feel independent in Alabama?
318.0,350.0,Subject,"No. You gotta rely on people. And plus, if you don't got a car and probably the people around you, you got to rely on people when they go without your money. And you got to depend on workers, case workers and all of that. I ain't going to live like that. It was a bad way of living. I like my independence better in New York. You don't have to depend on nobody."
350.0,354.75,Interviewer,Yeah. So what is it you like about it?
354.75,355.0,Subject,New York?
355.0,356.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
356.0,402.0,Subject,"The trains and stuff run 24 hours. There's things to do in New York, a lot of things, a lot of job opportunities, you just got to apply for it. There's more work out here, and just work part-time and keep my check and I'll be good, or take a little bit out of my check and I'll still make more than what my check is. Just work part-time, hopefully, things going up and up. I'm just praying to God that it come quick, to be more independent and [inaudible], make my own money, and I don't have to ask my family for nothing."
402.0,404.0,Interviewer,You don't like asking your family for help?
404.0,421.0,Subject,"Not really, no. I know they would help me but I don't want to be a nuisance. And [inaudible] always asking for things, asking for something, you're looking for a handout. I don't want to be the guy looking for a handout. I wanna be the one who stand on my own two feet."
421.0,431.0,Interviewer,"It seems like you've been feeling more like you're standing on your own two feet lately, huh?"
431.0,475.0,Subject,"Yeah, I am. But when I get financially stable, I'll be better. That's all I need is financially-- is to be stable. And I not looking for a lot of money, but I'm looking for a check every week or every two weeks to just-- my expenses [inaudible] I'm not paying for my expenses is not enough. After you pay your bills, you're broke. But if get a job it would be much better, a job I like, a job that is comfortable, and stability, produce a better livelihood."
475.0,483.0,Interviewer,Absolutely. So what do you think you'd like to do?
483.0,493.0,Subject,I'd like to do messenger work or security. My security classes gonna be two weeks from now.
493.0,494.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk] everything.
494.0,497.0,Subject,I went to my program before I came here.
497.0,498.0,Interviewer,That's great.
498.0,521.0,Subject,"Yeah. They'll get my 8016 and my license, I just got to be patient. Hopefully, things looking up and up, it'd be better for me. That what make me depressed, when I can't take care of myself, and I don't got no money, and there's things to do to take care of myself. That depresses me."
521.0,527.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Sounds like you've got some exciting plans coming up though.
527.0,550.0,Subject,"A little exciting, just standing on my own two feet and that's a blessing by itself. Hopefully, things look up. You just gotta keep hope a lot, and don't get depressed, and don't get lazy and stay in bed all day, or stay in a room and start hearing voices, try to stay out of the house so you won't get claustrophobic."
550.0,563.0,Interviewer,"So what do you think you're looking forward to the most, these next few weeks? It's sounds like you got a few exciting things coming up."
563.0,578.0,Subject,"Hopefully, to do something I like and not worry about it. I know jobs aren't going to be 100% likable but it beats being broke."
578.0,589.0,Interviewer,And what were the two kinds of jobs you said? You said security and--?
589.0,593.0,Subject,Foot messenger. Travel around the city.
593.0,597.0,Interviewer,Cool. What made you think of that one?
597.0,603.0,Subject,Because I did it before and I liked it. I just hope I can go back.
603.0,605.0,Interviewer,What was it like?
605.0,667.0,Subject,"It was like traveling the city and make your day go faster. I like traveling around the city. There's a lot to see in the city. You're definite when you got a destination to go to, so you got a reason to walk around the city instead of just walking around doing nothing, you're getting paid walking around the city. It's an easy job. There's no supervisors breathing down your neck. It's an easy job to do, and I know the city, so it's easy money for me. Yeah, it's just I like to sight see and all of that, the Trump Tower, the Empire State Building, the One World Trade Center and the fashion districts. I see a lot of rich people in they apartments that's something I can never afford. I like to see that-- like to see different things and dropping off packages keep you busy. I like being kept busy. I like to have a job that keep me busy than me being bored and just twiddling my fingers."
667.0,669.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Sounds like a really fun job.
669.0,674.0,Subject,It is fun. It get hard but it's fun.
674.0,676.0,Interviewer,It gets hard?
676.0,708.0,Subject,"Yeah, when you get too many packages and they rush you, but other than that, that's not the hard part about it. I like the job because nobody's breathing down your neck. You don't got your supervisors and your bosses breathing down your neck. You just got a time limit but after you beat the time limit, basically, it's all you. It's an easy job. It's an easy job. It's an easy job. I'd like to do it again if I ever have the opportunity."
708.0,719.0,Interviewer,So then there's that and then the security?
719.0,736.0,Subject,"Security just like a hustle job, a quick dollar. Security pays good. I like to doing security. There's good money in security."
736.0,738.0,Interviewer,What do you like about that?
738.0,783.0,Subject,"With security, I just do it for the money. It's a legit job and a legit hustle. Security not difficult, you follow procedures and you be good. It depends what kind of security you do, if you got security control in public it depends what kind of security you do. Some security jobs would be easy, some security jobs would be hard. So it depends on what type of security company and what they have you doing, that's all. But a job is a job, there ain't no such thing as a perfect job. Even the messenger, they got day ins and outs, so I'm just looking to be employed, that's all."
783.0,788.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you like the messenger one better than the security one?
788.0,795.0,Subject,"Much better. Security I just do for the money, messenger I would like doing."
795.0,800.0,Interviewer,Security jobs would just be for the money.
800.0,837.0,Subject,"Just for the money. Just for the easy 4, 500 a week, like part-time. And I'd just do security for the money. But I want to get that license, though, because that license important in case I have a-- in case I don't get a [inaudible], security's always hiring. You can't go wrong with security because they always hiring. Yeah, you always going to find a job with security if you got the right-- if you got the license and the certificate, you always find a job. My main goal is to get my license back."
837.0,839.0,Interviewer,You're main goal is to get the license from the security back?
839.0,873.0,Subject,"Yeah, through my program. That's the job you could always fall back on. In case things don't work out, you'll always will have a security job. Security job pays sometimes-- some security companies pay good money. I'm getting old, not old, but I need to make better life decisions than I've been making. Can't be doing foolish things with my life no more."
873.0,875.0,Interviewer,Foolish things?
875.0,938.0,Subject,"Like things you just do when you were young but you can't do it no more when you get older because life is serious and you don't want to be messed up and be panhandling and begging people, or being some type of bum on the street, or homeless because your behaviors affects a lot of people. So I don't want to be homeless because it's the first thing, you could be kicked out your apartment acting a certain way or bring your trouble to people. So I just want to work, and just be independent, work and go out, be independent. That's when I stand on my own two feet without causing trouble. A legit job, make legit money without doing anything illegal because I don't want to do nothing illegal. I just want to make a good-- just make some money legally and live good, live positive. That's all I want."
938.0,944.0,Interviewer,"Seems like things are really looking up for you. You've got some great ideas for what's coming next, exciting things coming up."
944.0,986.0,Subject,"Yeah. I just keep trying, that's all. Yeah. I got to put my needs before my wants because I want a lot of things but I got to put my needs first. Like I need a cigarette but I don't need it, nah, can I want a cigarette but I don't need a cigarette. There's a difference between a need and a want, and that's one thing I realize in life, certain things you need and certain things you want, you can have. You can always-- you can't always have what you want but you need to get things what you need first to better your life, for the time being."
986.0,990.0,Interviewer,You've been thinking a lot about putting your needs before your wants?
990.0,1049.0,Subject,"Yeah. I got to because everybody doesn't have the time or the money because everybody working, everybody doing this. I just want to be working too. Everybody sort of struggling, definitely in New York. New York everybody living from check to check because New York is expensive. Yeah. You can't just, like certain behaviors. You just can't get mad at nobody because they going through the same thing you're going through. They all looking for work. And, plus, I like to be independent. I don't like ask people for things. The more independent I am, the more happier I'll be. That's my goal, just to be more independent, but not needing people unless it's minor. Other than that, money-wise, I won't need nobody. I just want to be stable."
1049.0,1056.0,Interviewer,Your main goal is to be stable and independent.
1056.0,1204.0,Subject,"Yep, more independent than I am. Go to work, come home, go to school, be more independent without needing people. I need programs and stuff like the Ticket to Work. They have me-- that's the program for disability. They give me my free 8 hours, my 16, and my license. I won't get that before I start my messenger job because that license, I'm going to need. I'm going to do it smart because message job always come, but the thing is, though, if I get fired, I have to pay 5, 600 dollars-- 3, 400 dollars for a security license if I can get it for free. So I'll get that for free first, for the proper security, and then I might do messenger work. It depends, part-time or full-time or I'll do both part-time. Be independent without needing the system because I don't believe in a system-way of living. Again, it's more of a side check. I'm not trying to be super psychological but that's side check can do nothing but pay your bills and that's it. I want to be more independent than dependent on the check. I don't want to depend on my check, I don't want to depend on nobody. Hopefully, I'll keep my insurance because they said to the worst I could keep my insurance for three years. So I can always get back on social security. But hopefully, I'll find a good job with good insurance with a security job because security you can always go higher than your demands. Security jobs you can move up so, hopefully, I'll get a security job and stay there because I'm getting older now. I can't think young and stupid like I did before when I was younger. All my brothers, and my friends, and my sisters have kids and they got good jobs so I should be more independent, too, without asking people for money."
1204.0,1210.0,Interviewer,"You're feeling like you're getting older now, and you want more independence and to stand on your own two feet."
1210.0,1235.0,Subject,"Yeah, that's what I want, for real. The other crap, I couldn't really care less about. I mean, not to say crap, but to be independent is more my goals. Standing on my two feet is more my goal, without leeching off people. I don't want to be no leech, no bother, no pest. I'm just going to stand on my own two feet."
1235.0,1240.0,Interviewer,"Did you feel like, in the past, you weren't trying as hard to be independent?"
1240.0,1323.0,Subject,"Out of my past, I was first that-- when I first got diagnosed sick I was so delusional, not delusional, but outcome of youth. I thought things was easy. I thought I had everything. I had my license and everything. I thought everything's suppose to be given to you, then I've been homeless and I realized these things can really happen. You can really be homeless. You can also be in the streets begging. I don't want to be that guy who homeless, and begging, and keep making mistakes. I just want to move up. I got my own room. I want to move up to an apartment. I just want to be more independent, that's all. I just want to be independent because my friends is grown. They in their 30s, I'm 30, get my life together the best way I could because nobody-- it's not all playground, like we did in high school when joking around. Things got serious and people getting older, we can't do the same thing we did when we was younger because we get old. Not old. Not old man, but you can't do the same things you did when you were like 15, 16 and 21 at 30. It don't feel right or look right no more, plus you know better at 30. That's what I think."
1323.0,1326.0,Interviewer,You think you know better at 30?
1326.0,1355.0,Subject,"Yeah. 30, you know better, even with mental health you know better. Like, mental health you should stay on your meds and things be good. Me, I stays on my meds so I'm going to go back to no mental hospital because mental hospitals is horrible, and plus I don't want to be there. I'm not that sick to be in a mental hospital. I'll just want to get myself focused, and get a job, and be good."
1355.0,1365.0,Interviewer,What was it like to be in the mental hospital?
1365.0,1442.0,Subject,"It was horrible. The staff was rude, them people crazy, it was like a hellhole. I was just want to hurry and get out of there, just want to hurry and get out of there. You got people who less function than you acting all crazy, you've got the doctors cursing you out, the doctors acting like patients, the doctors don't want to be there because they-- it's horrible. I don't ever want to be there. That's the last place I want to be in my lifetime, is a mental hospital. That's the worst place I've ever been in in my life. I don't know how people could do months or years in a mental hospital. That's the most baddest place I've been to. Of course, like being in jail because you can't go outside. It's like being in jail, locked up. You stay on one floor for like two, three weeks but they don't get no sunshine, no air, living with the crazy people and doctors. It's not a good place. I don't see how people can get better in a mental hospital. That's where you get worse. You get worse in mental hospital because you get used to the hospital living. I want to be high in a hospital, that's bad living."
1442.0,1446.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Sounds like that was a really frustrating experience for you.
1446.0,1483.0,Subject,"It was frustrating. A bad place to be and I don't want to go back, if I have the power to, because I'm not going back. As long as I stay on my meds, I'll be good. I see my doctor and my therapist, I'll be good. As long as I find me employment, I'll be good. I can live in society. I really don't care what people say or think, but I just don't want to be in a mental hospital with those doctors and those patients."
1483.0,1490.0,Interviewer,"Sounds like you have a lot of really good plans for how to keep yourself doing well and not have to go back there, huh?"
1490.0,1548.0,Subject,"Yeah. I just learned over the years, your behaviors affect a lot of people. You have to watch how you behave and how you talk to people because your behaviors could be destructive or you could ruin chances with your behavior and what you say. You could burn bridges and people won't want to help you no more and you can't keep BSing people, that people got times and things that they need to do. People that, otherwise, society, everybody got something to do, so you can't waste nobody time because their time is valuable. Less is appointment people, not your friends but business-wise."
1548.0,1550.0,Interviewer,"Less is important, did you say?"
1550.0,1590.0,Subject,"No, you just can't-- with me doing business, gotta learn their time is valuable. You just can't waste people time because people-- if you keep BSing people, people will cut you off and you'll lose resources, and these are resources you need to survive, definitely in New York. So I'm learning how to take things seriously. If they want me to go to school in the Bronx, I'm going to the Bronx, all the way from Brooklyn, I just got to wake up early, that's all. I just waste nobody's time and keep my life moving forward instead of backwards."
1590.0,1592.0,Interviewer,You're trying to keep your life moving forward?
1592.0,1602.0,Subject,Yeah. It's better than going backwards.
1602.0,1607.0,Interviewer,So you're going to tell the security people you don't mind where the training is?
1607.0,1660.0,Subject,"No [inaudible]. They pay for it. So when they pay for something, you just can't demand certain things, if it's coming out the program pockets, because you can say you want this, I want that, but you ain't paying out your own money, so you got to do what they got to say if they paying for it. So you got to do what they got to do because I don't got no money to pay $300 just for security license and certificate, because they're paying for it so I better do what they say. I get my license and my security certificates before they cut me off. A security license is like a guaranteed job because everybody looking for licensed security guards."
1660.0,1662.0,Interviewer,That's exciting.
1662.0,1714.0,Subject,"Yeah, you always have a job when you got your license. That's why I want to get it back because I've been out of them for seven years, and I never got it renewed because I was in Alabama seven years. I'm a born New Yorker but I've been to Alabama for seven years. So I went there like 21, 22, probably like 23, 24, I went to Alabama. And I didn't like how it worked there and I didn't like the results, so I came back to New York. Because New York, there's things out here in New York you could do because I didn't want to be in the racist south. South has nothing out there, they dirt poor and they racist. Not everybody racist, but what I experience is New York is more the best places to live at."
1714.0,1716.0,Interviewer,It was racist down there?
1716.0,1754.0,Subject,"There's racism, yeah. But the thing is, though, everywhere racist but the things that everybody resources, they dirt poor down there, they ain't no money down there, they poor. So I don't want to be in that environment. I see why people left the south back in the days because it's poor. You can't do nothing with that. Ain't no resources, ain't enough jobs, no jobs, none of all that, anyone live like that. I need to keep moving forward in my life. I just like a blast from the past."
1754.0,1765.0,Interviewer,You feel like you're a lot more able to move forward in New York?
1765.0,1768.0,Subject,"Yeah, New York, yeah. I feel like I can move forward in New York."
1768.0,1781.0,Interviewer,"That's great. All right. Well I think we can stop there, [inaudible]. Thank you for sharing all this with me. It's really nice chatting with you."
