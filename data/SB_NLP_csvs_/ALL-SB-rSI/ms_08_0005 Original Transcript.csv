1.0,30.0,Interviewer,"Testing. Testing. Okay. So we can go ahead and start. As I said, this part's recorded. And so this is a really informal part of the study. The idea is to get to know you a little bit better, to try to understand what it's like being Alex Bienstock. So can you tell me, I guess, a little bit about how are things going lately?"
30.0,98.0,Subject,"Things have been much better than when certain symptoms started a couple years ago. But any time there's a lot of stress or financial stress or I'm not sleeping, then certain things start happening that sort of disturb just my everyday functioning. But I'm working right now, and I'm living with my dad. I'm seeing friends. So right now I don't have a ton of complaints. A couple months ago, I had some racing thoughts that were very negative. And I ended up going to the hospital because I was told to by my mom. She thought that I was sort of displaying some things that were abnormal. And that was just really the last time I went to a hospital, and I stayed there for, like, four or five hours during the night, and then I was released, but."
98.0,99.0,Interviewer,That sounds scary.
99.0,116.0,Subject,"Yeah, it is a little scary. There was just times-- I haven't had full-on, complete, psychotic episodes, I think, in a while. But I'll still be triggered once in a while, and I'll have racing thoughts and not be able to control certain negative feelings."
116.0,121.0,Interviewer,"So it sounds like, generally, you've been doing relatively well?"
121.0,125.0,Subject,Yeah. Generally. Definitely.
125.0,130.0,Interviewer,"And just every once in a while when you aren't getting sleep, it gets worse it sounds like?"
130.0,141.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And a lot of it has to do with financial problems. That is really what triggers a lot."
141.0,143.0,Interviewer,So finances are on your mind a lot?
143.0,146.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
146.0,149.0,Interviewer,So you're working full-time these days?
149.0,151.0,Subject,I am working full-time. I'm working at a place that sells CPAP machines for people with sleep apnea.
151.0,159.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
159.0,188.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I'm sort of an office manager. I'm doing sales here and there. And I had that job-- it'll be three or four months ago I started, and it's been going really well. Right before that is when things weren't that great is when I was in between jobs. I didn't know what was going to happen. So I got kind of lucky and found something. It's going fine. I'm just trying to save money to move out and stuff like that."
188.0,192.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So moving out is one of your goals?
192.0,293.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think so. I mean, I'm still paying my dad for rent. I don't have free rent. It's not that easy, but I'm just paying a lot less, obviously, than if I lived in New York in my own apartment. So I'm happy that I'm with him, but I feel that I'm sort of-- that I should probably move out. I used to live in Brooklyn, and things were getting too rough, and I lost a job. And I just wasn't really sure if I could maintain paying rent, so I had to move in with my dad. That's sort of what happened. And all those things started giving me negative feelings again. I've always had problems with a lot of jobs, whether it was from not sleeping or overthinking or not being able to pay attention or just kind of being anti-authoritive. But this job, it's sort of through a family member. And there's a lot of like-- I'm on a computer it's not-- before I was doing restaurant work or warehouse work or kind of work that was just really physically stressful, and I didn't feel like I was getting compensated enough. So I'm a lot happier with my position now. So as soon as I save up enough-- I don't have any trouble saving. But just because I do come into the city a lot, it's hard to just kind of keep up an interesting, fun social life and be able to save."
293.0,294.0,Interviewer,Amen.
294.0,298.0,Subject,Yeah [laughter].
298.0,303.0,Interviewer,"So the new job is a step up from what you were doing before, you feel like? It's been more exciting."
303.0,322.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's not exactly exciting, just more relaxed and less stressful. I have more autonomy. I just feel better about my station in life working in that situation."
322.0,331.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's great. Yeah. So what do you like about the job?
331.0,363.0,Subject,"I just like that I'm helping people get something that they really need because they can die in their sleep or they don't sleep well. And this machine, obviously, really changes their lives, and it works really well for them. So I like that there's a usefulness to it and that I got to sort of learn an inventory of products, and that was a nice challenge. And then I'm just speaking to more people while I'm learning."
363.0,364.0,Interviewer,You get to speak to a lot of people?
364.0,373.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah. So the other jobs I've had in the past, except a few, it was very isolated."
373.0,377.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I bet. Isolated. So those were jobs like--?"
377.0,439.0,Subject,"Like working in the warehouse. I was working in a gallery warehouse where I was packing art and moving stuff and art installing. And I just didn't really like that industry. And then also being a back waiter at a couple restaurants or being a runner. I was doing that for a while, and I just didn't feel like I ever-- I just didn't really enjoy what I was doing. I was just on automatic pilot and just kind of doing whatever they told me to do. I didn't feel like I had any initiative or reason for what I was doing. For this job, there's a bonus and you sell something. So every day, there's sort of like rewards if it goes well. There's just more quick-- I don't know the word. There's more recognition for doing a good job."
439.0,444.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And there's constant real things that you find satisfying in terms of that.
444.0,445.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
445.0,450.0,Interviewer,You sell something to someone other than you. Do you get to sort of teach them about--?
450.0,473.75,Subject,"Yeah. You teach them. You go through the motions. You show them machines. You give them things for free. You just put together a good package deal, and they're happy with what they buy. And that's rewarding more than just dropping off dishes at a table or just packing crates all day. There's just more to it."
473.75,474.0,Interviewer,Absolutely.
474.0,476.0,Subject,So I like that.
476.0,483.0,Interviewer,"And it sounded like you feel also like it's sort of altruistic a little bit because this is a machine that is really, truly, helping people."
483.0,543.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And [inaudible] jobs in the warehouse, I had to scan thousands and thousands of objects every day, and that was just terrible. And I would go outside and chain smoke and just wanted to be on [inaudible] more and I just-- that was really creating a really serious problem. I wasn't able to sleep. I was feeling really a lot of sort of existential dread. I'm not feeling purposeful. And that in combination with some relationship issues, I was just in a really, really bad place. So since then, it's a lot better. But the next hurdle I guess is just moving out on my own, even though it's not really the biggest deal ever. You know what I mean? It's like I want to move out and it'll probably happen, but it's going to take longer than I really thought it would."
543.0,547.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] it was going to take?
547.0,568.0,Subject,"I think so. Yeah. Just because I'm just not really good at saving yet. I just haven't really learned that yet. I'm not really good at budgeting. I just like little perks of just having extra money, and putting away money has just been hard."
568.0,571.0,Interviewer,Has it been frustrating to--?
571.0,599.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's definitely frustrating. I get kind of upset about it. But it's really more of just kind of trying to keep up with sort of societal norms and stuff like that of where you're supposed to be at a certain age. Or it's hard to be in a relationship if you're still living at home. Stuff like that. So it's not so much that I'm so much bothered by it, it's really just expectations."
599.0,600.0,Interviewer,Absolutely.
600.0,601.0,Subject,Yeah.
601.0,607.0,Interviewer,"And this city we live in, too-- it's full of weird expectations."
607.0,611.0,Subject,"Right, right, right. They're very hard to kind of meet."
611.0,623.0,Interviewer,Absolutely. But it sounds like things took a turn for the better when you started the job then?
623.0,657.0,Subject,"Yeah. Definitely. I don't know if it's a long-term thing, but so far it's going really good for my resume. I've just learned a couple new things. I'm an artist. I went to school for art. And that's sort of, I guess, more of a passion. More of just a hobby I'm really into. And then the work has always just been work. It's always just been getting a paycheck. So I try to keep up with art, too. And so it's just really balancing both things and trying to find time."
657.0,660.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what do you do to keep up with the art?
660.0,681.0,Subject,"Just like being invited to shows, trying to come up with artworks and make things, draw, sculpture, performance pieces. Just kind of always have something to do. Read. I've been writing a little bit more than usual. That's been helpful. Yeah."
681.0,683.0,Interviewer,So you are actually showing your art at shows?
683.0,723.0,Subject,"Yeah, I show my art. Yeah. And I recently got published somewhere. I was really happy about that. And I just try to use as many little skills as I have to make money to be a part of a community or just to sort of get out of only caring about my job because my job really is just for a paycheck. I would be okay with being their forever to just get a good paycheck because I don't want to depend on my art to make money. But it's really just about doing both simultaneously, and that's sort of the challenge."
723.0,733.0,Interviewer,"So those are sort of the two things you want to do with your life, it sounds like-- is keep the paycheck coming, and you want to live this other more meaningful life, would you say?"
733.0,735.0,Subject,Yeah.
735.0,738.0,Interviewer,It sounds like you get a lot of meaning and happiness from doing the art.
738.0,743.75,Subject,"Oh, definitely. Yeah. Sometimes, yeah. Not all the time."
743.75,744.0,Interviewer,Not all the time.
744.0,746.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah."
746.0,748.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Why do you love being an artist?
748.0,802.0,Subject,"I think it's pretty good, but it's just-- it's sort of never enough. Like you always want to make more. You always want to sell more. You always want to be in this roadshow. You want to know this right person. You just kind of get to places little by little and you make art little by little. And it's expensive sometimes. A lot of it has to do with kind of being validated by other people, which is a bit challenging. But there's rewarding aspects to it, too. And I'm kind of ambivalent about a lot of things, too, like I feel like I make a lot of art that's sort of ironically detached from sort of enjoying making work to [inaudible]. Like it could be a little cynical or something."
802.0,805.0,Interviewer,So some of your work you feel like is cynical?
805.0,842.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. But also fun and adventurous. Yeah. I mean, I've been at it for a while and I've been [inaudible] on a show and it's really fun. But there's always more. There's always sort of echelons to sort of reach, and it's really just about trying to stay ambitious. But at the same time, not being just a pure opportunist or something. Just enjoy what you do. I just want to enjoy what I do. Yeah."
842.0,845.0,Interviewer,It sounds like you enjoy the art oftentimes.
845.0,849.0,Subject,"Most of the time, yeah. I like the community involved."
849.0,850.0,Interviewer,What about the community?
850.0,898.0,Subject,"Just being a part of events, and socializing, and having a kind of group that you can share ideals and values. And it just creates sort of a social life by going to shows and-- which is really good. That's what I really like. You know what I'm saying? Because I started-- when I was making music when I was really young, it was sort all about the scene or something and it's just-- I've organized things. I've had charity things. I just like people sharing and appreciating each other's expression."
898.0,906.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. Wow. So the community is a really big part of what you enjoy about being an artist it seems?"
906.0,908.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah."
908.0,912.0,Interviewer,Cool. So is the community other artists or--?
912.0,945.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's mostly other artists and then-- whether it's writers or musicians or just people that enjoy the arts. But there's definitely communities. There's groups in the lower east side. Groups in Bushwick. I just like kind of knowing people from different communities and sort of trying to collaborate with the other shows and meet people, do studio visits. It's very, very rewarding socially."
945.0,948.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. Wow. It sounds like you're really active with the social--"
948.0,950.0,Subject,I try to be. Yeah.
950.0,954.0,Interviewer,"I bet it takes a lot of time to do all these-- put together collaborations, to produce your work, go to shows."
954.0,977.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, if I don't do stuff like that, then I get really isolated and depressed and stuff like that. So it just kind of keeps me motivated and meeting people because I just want to develop relationships with a lot of different people."
977.0,989.0,Interviewer,"And the art community, it sounds like, is a really-- is a way that you have found to do that. So you used to do a different kind of art? You used to do music?"
989.0,1055.0,Subject,"Yeah. I used to do music. I still do music here and there. I started with kind of punk and hardcore and screamo, sort of like suburban countercultural bands. And put together shows, played shows. And just into experimental music and learned a little jazz guitar. And again, it's the same thing. It's just meeting people, jamming, and that's just-- it's always been really always about that. And then if you can sell work, too, once in a while that's always a big positive, so. But a lot of times the people that buy your work at first are people who know you through the community or friends or-- so everybody just kind of supports each other and helps each other out. So that's just what I love about it. And whether it's music or art or writing, to me it all kind of blends together."
1055.0,1057.0,Interviewer,So writing is another thing that you do? A third thing?
1057.0,1067.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'm crazy. I like to do it all. And it's not that I'm a master of everything. It's more just that I want to dip into different things."
1067.0,1070.0,Interviewer,"You get a lot out of it, it sounds like to me, no matter which one you're doing."
1070.0,1085.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah. I mean, I got published recently, and that was really good. It felt good to make money off of writing because that seems like something, an option, to make extra money on the side."
1085.0,1088.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. You're already enjoying it, so why not?"
1088.0,1095.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah. And there's only so much I want to do for free at a certain point, too."
1095.0,1096.0,Interviewer,Right.
1096.0,1112.0,Subject,"I mean, I could start a blog and say, write about everything, but if I could just-- it's just I need to make sure my time is well-spent, so I can sort of afford the things I want to have, so."
1112.0,1116.0,Interviewer,Absolutely. What kind of writing do you like to do?
1116.0,1148.0,Subject,"Pretty much art reviews and philosophical stuff or biographical things, sort of just daily thoughts or aphorisms or just kind of little short stories. Just kind of very open-ended. But to get paid, mostly art reviews about shows and sort of broad statements about certain artists. That's what I've done."
1148.0,1151.0,Interviewer,So you'll actually write a formal review?
1151.0,1262.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I did recently a formal review of an artist that showed at the Brooklyn Museum, this guy David Levine. And I actually felt really connected to the work because a lot of it had to do with sort of paranoia. And it had a lot to do with fake crowds and whether political fake crowds or fake friends on Google or Instagram. Just sort of this idea of a big crowd or the mass being paid for or something. And that stoked me and it actually freaked me out because on the first night we had a lecture and a bunch of people gave a standing ovation, and then you find out later that they were actors. And it sort of makes you wonder who was actually there to be there and who was paid, and it sort of gave me this paranoid perspective of the rest of the work, and his photos, sculptures. But it was all about mass manipulation. And I was really happy to write that, and it felt good. And it was published in Art in America, and I was really excited about that. And I just feel like-- yeah. I'm just trying to get my name out there, get my perspective out there. But that show, in particular, was really good for me because I've experienced paranoia, and I've experienced a kind of distrust and skepticism of things that are popular or mainstream or-- you get what I'm saying, right?"
1262.0,1264.0,Interviewer,Absolutely.
1264.0,1267.0,Subject,Yeah.
1267.0,1271.0,Interviewer,So that show resonated with you especially [crosstalk]?
1271.0,1272.0,Subject,Yeah. So I was happy to write about it.
1272.0,1273.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1273.0,1275.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah."
1275.0,1277.0,Interviewer,So that made writing the review even more enjoyable?
1277.0,1330.0,Subject,"Yeah. It was very enjoyable. And he sort of gave a little history of fake crowds, and he was talking about the emperor Nero, how he would pay his soldiers to cheer for him, and sort of how that manipulated the people to also cheer for him and support things that he did and-- there was other things, too, that were sort of historical. Just that whole idea really resonated with me that there's sort of-- and there's a lot of pay for crowd or crowds for hire companies now and market influencing and kind of just people using Instagram to sell things and then getting fake bots so it looks like they have more followers so that attracts more people to buy their stuff. Just that kind of mass manipulation was really interesting to me."
1330.0,1340.0,Interviewer,"Absolutely. So even though some of that spoke to you in passing, it sounds like it wasn't very distressing to you?"
1340.0,1402.0,Subject,"No, it wasn't distressing or disturbing. But I have that ability to kind of conspire or to sort of be skeptical in the kind of like-- maybe more than just your average viewer. So it spoke to me that way. Because I understand it very much intellectually, in terms of like losing your ground on reality, so. And how sometimes there's like actual little truths to that. Even though it could be a psychotic thing, there is actual conspiracies or there is fakeness or anti-truthness in the world today. So those are little things that would spark me in the past, so."
1402.0,1404.0,Interviewer,And the crowds for hiring?
1404.0,1433.0,Subject,"Right. Yeah. But then a lot of psychotic episodes weren't necessarily about that, but it just had a lot to do with distrust and sort of like [inaudible] or paranoia that something wasn't real. So it just kind of-- yeah. It was just really coincidental that this thing I was assigned to was something that I could kind of speak to."
1433.0,1438.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Oh, so you were assigned to that and yet it still happened to be a really strongly resonate thing with you?"
1438.0,1447.0,Subject,Yeah. Because the guy probably knew it was something that I would be interested in because the editor has known me for a while.
1447.0,1448.0,Interviewer,That sounds like it was really exciting to do?
1448.0,1454.0,Subject,"Yeah, it was. Yeah. I'm just kind of looking for a new show that I want to write about."
1454.0,1455.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1455.0,1459.0,Subject,Yeah.
1459.0,1462.0,Interviewer,Do you think that editor will give you new ones to write about?
1462.0,1481.0,Subject,"I think he will. I think he wants me to come up with some things. I pitched something recently, but it was turned down. But he said to keep doing it, keep pitching. And they really liked the review. The artist even emailed Art in America and said it was really good. It was really positive, so."
1481.0,1482.0,Interviewer,Wow. That's great.
1482.0,1487.0,Subject,I just have to find something else that I want to write about because I'm kind of picky about it.
1487.0,1492.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What do you do to try to find something to write about?
1492.0,1525.0,Subject,"I just sort of look around and see what's happening, what shows are going on. And I see if I recognize names or look at the press release and just see if it's something that I feel like going into or sort of putting detail because a lot of it is just sort of-- it's good artists, and they're showing, and it's fine. But it's not always a kind of good thesis or good concept that I want to actually write about. I mean, everybody has their own interests, so."
1525.0,1526.0,Interviewer,Right.
1526.0,1527.0,Subject,You know?
1527.0,1531.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It sounds like something like that resonating feeling you had.
1531.0,1543.0,Subject,"Yeah. I have to have that because otherwise, it just feels like I'm just going through the motions, so I can't really-- I don't enjoy it unless it resonates with me."
1543.0,1548.0,Interviewer,Are these things paid like you--?
1548.0,1549.0,Subject,Yeah.
1549.0,1556.0,Interviewer,Okay. Yeah. So do you do some writing that's unpaid like the little things you--?
1556.0,1578.0,Subject,"Yeah. The little things, blogs here and there, Instagram posts, Facebook things. I would never like-- if I was going to write for like-- I mean, a friend of mine wants me to write something on her blog. I mean, I'll do it, but it's-- if I'm going to sort of talk-- if I'm going to put a lot of time and patience and formalize it really well, then I would want to get paid."
1578.0,1581.0,Interviewer,Right. Yeah. It takes a long time to write well.
1581.0,1607.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Other things you can just write quickly and you don't care about certain punctuation or form. It's just sort of rambling thoughts. And I like doing that a lot, but I wouldn't-- because when you write for money, you also have to go through an editor and do a couple drafts. It's just more of a like a formal kind of hierarchical, bureaucratic thing."
1607.0,1610.0,Interviewer,What is that like? Editors and stuff?
1610.0,1689.0,Subject,"I thought it was-- at first, it was a little challenging because it was annoying that this like, ""Oh, they don't like this way that you wrote it,"" or, ""They don't like that word,"" or ""They don't like this,"" or-- but it's good, too, that the guy that I was working with was very sort of challenging and it almost felt like being in school again. So it was like, ""Well, what do you mean by this?"" or, ""Why say that?"" or, ""What proof do you have for that?"" or, ""This seems like a generalization."" It's good to have somebody who is a reader telling you what isn't making sense to them. When you're writing completely for yourself, you're just happy that it makes sense for you, but to read well and for other people to comprehend it perfectly, you kind of need that outsider perspective. In terms of making art, you wouldn't really want somebody to say, ""I want more green here,"" or, ""You should do this,"" or, ""You should do that."" But with writing publicly for a magazine, it's really like any other kind of commercial industry where you're sort of working for a specific public that needs to understand exactly what you're saying. So it was a good experience."
1689.0,1693.0,Interviewer,"So you feel like the editor was able to give you that eye of like, ""I'm sort of the public person."""
1693.0,1695.0,Subject,Right. Yeah.
1695.0,1706.0,Interviewer,And also his comments or her comments made you feel like they're helpful and almost felt like they were helping you learn a little bit?
1706.0,1753.0,Subject,"Yeah. It definitely helped me learn. At first I didn't like it, but then I realized it was beneficial and just to make things more smooth. And sometimes the way I write normally without a kind of critical eye is a little bit more complex or overwrought or more rambling. So they just kind of you know-- there's all these ways to sort of take out words. There's all these ways to just be as sharp-nosed and specific as possible. I mean, some writers naturally just get a little bit more verbose, and I have a tendency to do that. So this is good to sort of learn what certain magazines want."
1753.0,1759.0,Interviewer,"Oh, so the editor has an idea of what the magazine-- what style they want in the magazine? That makes sense."
1759.0,1776.0,Subject,"Yeah. Unless you're like-- you've been doing it for a very long time and you have a very specific style, then they're probably more lenient. But at first, you kind of have to fit a little bit into what they're looking for probably."
1776.0,1783.0,Interviewer,"All right. Well, that's a fine place to go ahead and stop. But was there anything else I didn't think to ask you about that you were wanting to talk about?"
1783.0,1786.0,Subject,Not-- it was good.
