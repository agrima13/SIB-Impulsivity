tmin,tmax,speaker,message
0.0,5.0,Interviewer,Okay. So the first thing I'm going to ask is just how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,14.0,Subject,It's been going good. Trying to be detailed. 
14.0,16.0,Interviewer,So what's been good?
16.0,19.0,Subject,I'm starting to play the ukulele.
19.0,20.0,Interviewer,Cool.
20.0,29.0,Subject,I got a pet lizard. Yeah. So that's been fun. 
29.0,32.0,Interviewer,"So this pet lizard, how did that come into your life?"
32.0,65.0,Subject,"Actually, I was going to Petco for fish. I went in the lizard section by accident. And I just saw them, and I was like, ""I want a lizard."" I wanted the really big one that grew up to three feet. And we had space for it, but my mom was freaked out [laughter]. So she said, ""No, you can have the smallest lizard here."" And the smallest lizard is still 10 inches, so it's fat [laughter]. So yeah. So I got that. "
65.0,69.0,Interviewer,And what drew you to the lizard? 
69.0,72.0,Subject,I don't know. I guess I liked it. It looked cool. 
72.0,78.0,Interviewer,Okay. So tell me more about the lizard.
78.0,109.0,Subject,"I felt really bad when I was getting him because it was in the morning, and they're nocturnal. So there were a good maybe three or four of them in the tank, and they were all cuddling and sleeping. And then boom, this guy reaches down and picks him up and grabs him and puts him in a box. So I felt really bad. So I'm going to go buy food for him today and maybe another decoration thingy where he can hide and stuff. So yeah. "
109.0,111.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So where is he?
111.0,112.0,Subject,He's in my room.
112.0,113.0,Interviewer,Just your room?
113.0,114.0,Subject,Yeah. 
114.0,115.0,Interviewer,In a--
115.0,116.0,Subject,"In a tank, yeah. "
116.0,121.0,Interviewer,--tank. Okay. So what does he do all day?
121.0,135.0,Subject,"Well, right now, he's really scared. I'll try and touch him. You can try and touch them when you get them, but you can't hold them until like after a week. But he bites. So when I was getting him out of the box into the tank, I had to shake it to--"
135.0,136.0,Interviewer,Oh.
136.0,154.0,Subject,"Yeah. He was hissing at me every time I go to kind of touch him. He's really soft. So even though you think you're touching him lightly, your finger will weigh him down. So you have to be really gentle. He'll snap at you. "
154.0,155.0,Interviewer,He'll snap?
155.0,160.0,Subject,"They'll bite. They'll bite at you. But they're small, so it's kind of like a little nibble. "
160.0,169.0,Interviewer,And that's so interesting. What kind of lizard is it?
169.0,174.0,Subject,A leopard gecko. So the spots are really cool.
174.0,185.0,Interviewer,"Nice. Well, I don't know about [inaudible]. Okay. So why were you going to Petco in the first place, to get a fish?"
185.0,189.0,Subject,Yeah. And I left with a lizard. 
189.0,192.0,Interviewer,So what made you want a pet at all?
192.0,208.0,Subject,"I guess it was just something to do too. You take care of it. You feed it. You can play with it. A fish, you can't hold. So I guess that's what attracted me to the lizard, to put him on your shoulder. "
208.0,221.0,Interviewer,"And is having a pet something that you want? Is it something to do, or is it the pet itself?"
221.0,223.0,Subject,"No, I want it too. "
223.0,225.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that is?
225.0,236.0,Subject,"Not sure. It's just a cool thing to have. It's like a little friend, a little person there. "
236.0,237.0,Interviewer,Are you going to take him to school?
237.0,260.0,Subject,"I don't know if I could because he likes it hot. So I have a little heat pad under the tank to heat him up. So I don't know if I could take him out for that long. If he gets cold and-- maybe on a hot day, I'll take him to school. When I [don't?] have classes, I'll take him into class."
260.0,268.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you're going back to school. Are you excited?
268.0,272.0,Subject,Yeah. I've been out of school for a while.
272.0,273.0,Interviewer,Why?
273.0,277.0,Subject,I had a concussion in February. 
277.0,281.0,Interviewer,Right. So what happened there?
281.0,282.0,Subject,I fell down some stairs [laughter] really bad. 
282.0,285.0,Interviewer,"Oh, no."
285.0,287.0,Subject,Yeah. But I'm okay now. 
287.0,293.0,Interviewer,Okay. Good. And so what are you excited for about school?
293.0,299.0,Subject,Just the environment and going to classes and stuff. It's good. 
299.0,305.0,Interviewer,Do you have any particularly good memories from school?
305.0,317.0,Subject,"Not really. I've only been there for a semester. I made some friends there, but I feel like high school's way more fun because it was a K-12 school, so."
317.0,320.0,Interviewer,So you grew up together?
320.0,322.0,Subject,Yeah. 
322.0,324.0,Interviewer,So what about your friends from high school then?
324.0,339.0,Subject,"We still hang out. Nowadays, I've kind of been more distant. I feel kind of uncomfortable to go out and socialize and stuff. But I know it's good for me though, so I force myself and go out."
339.0,340.0,Interviewer,You force yourself?
340.0,343.0,Subject,Yeah. 
343.0,347.0,Interviewer,What do you think makes you feel uncomfortable?
347.0,372.0,Subject,"I'm not sure. I used to like to go out with my friends and stuff. That's when my parents didn't want me to go out all the time [laughter], and now they're like, ""No, you have to go out [laughter]."" I don't know. It wasn't all of a sudden. Maybe a little gradual, but I guess I just didn't notice it. And I just feel uncomfortable in social situations. "
372.0,375.0,Interviewer,What does that mean? How do you feel?
375.0,384.0,Subject,"It's like I don't really want to talk. Or it's like I'm always thinking about, ""Okay. If I say this or this,"" you know what I mean?"
384.0,385.0,Interviewer,Feel like you [crosstalk]--
385.0,389.0,Subject,Like I'd rather just be home. 
389.0,391.0,Interviewer,Why?
391.0,393.0,Subject,Don't know. 
393.0,395.0,Interviewer,What do you do at home?
395.0,401.0,Subject,Not much really. I bother my siblings a lot [laughter]. 
401.0,407.0,Interviewer,"How do you bother them? I'm an only child, so I don't understand the sibling bond. "
407.0,428.0,Subject,"Well, let's say my brother's doing something. Let's say he's doing homework. And I know it's not-- if it's not really important, then-- if it's really important-- he's studying for his SATs now, so I don't mess with him. But like I say, if he's just doing some homework or whatever, I'll take his book and hide it [laughter]."
428.0,430.0,Interviewer,And--
430.0,432.0,Subject,Little stuff like that. 
432.0,434.0,Interviewer,Are you close with your siblings?
434.0,454.0,Subject,"Yeah. I feel like I'm closer with them now. Before, I used to be kind of not mean, but I was more like, ""No, let me be by myself."" But nowadays, I'm trying to like, okay, force myself to go out. Now, I like hanging out with my siblings, especially my little sister."
454.0,455.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
455.0,456.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. 
456.0,457.0,Interviewer,Why her in particular?
457.0,461.0,Subject,"I don't know. She's just a little kid, and then I'm a little kid [laughter]."
461.0,462.0,Interviewer,How old is she?
462.0,463.0,Subject,9. 
463.0,466.0,Interviewer,9? So you guys are 10 years apart. 
466.0,468.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. 
468.0,470.0,Interviewer,So what do you like to do with her?
470.0,473.0,Subject,We hug-ups. We play hug-up. We just hug each other up.
473.0,475.0,Interviewer,
475.0,481.0,Subject,Watch Netflix. It's so hard to find something I can watch with her though [laughter].
481.0,482.0,Interviewer,I'm sure. 
482.0,504.0,Subject,"We watch shows together. We have a game called Bother [inaudible]. So she can't say [inaudible], which is my brother's name. So she calls him [inaudible]. And she couldn't say my name, [inaudible]. So she used to call me [inaudible]. So we have a game called Bother [inaudible], and we just bother him [laughter]. It's fun. "
504.0,515.0,Interviewer,That's so cute. And so it seems like you're close with both your siblings. How about your parents?
515.0,520.0,Subject,Yeah. I'm close with them. 
520.0,524.0,Interviewer,How do you think you're close?
524.0,532.0,Subject,Not as close as I am with my siblings. I feel like I don't really tell them much. 
532.0,535.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that is?
535.0,545.0,Subject,"I feel like they'll not judge me, but we'll butt heads. "
545.0,546.0,Interviewer,Butt head?
546.0,548.0,Subject,Yeah. 
548.0,549.0,Interviewer,What does that mean?
549.0,560.0,Subject,"Actually, I don't know. I've never really been open to my parents and stuff. So I know. "
560.0,561.0,Interviewer,That's interesting.
561.0,574.0,Subject,"Especially my dad. My dad is super religious. So like, ""Oh, well, cut that hair. Oh, why do you pierce your--?"" He doesn't know I pierced my ears. He thinks they're magnets still [laughter]."
574.0,580.0,Interviewer,Yeah. [inaudible]. Interesting. Are you religious?
580.0,597.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, but shaky. No, I try. I pray. I pray five times a day. They may not be on time. Sometimes, in the end of the day, I'll rush and pray everything together. I make sure I do it. "
597.0,603.0,Interviewer,And so tell me a little bit about praying.
603.0,607.0,Subject,You mean like how to do it?
607.0,613.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How you do it and why you do it. What it means to you. 
613.0,647.0,Subject,"For me, it's more giving thanks because I really have a lot. I have a family. I have my health. I go to school. Everything's pretty set for a good future. Not a lot of people have that. So even though this time of schizophrenia or whatever, it's not half as bad as what other people go through. So it affects but not really. It could be way worse. "
647.0,650.0,Interviewer,What do you think could be worse?
650.0,666.0,Subject,"My grandma died of cancer, not recently, but I think it's going to be a year coming up. So it could have been cancer. It could have been this, could have been that, but it's only schizophrenia. It's not really that bad. "
666.0,673.0,Interviewer,"So what does that word kind of mean to you, schizophrenia?"
673.0,680.0,Subject,"I guess it's just a word to-- okay, this and this and this is happening. So here's a word for it. "
680.0,682.0,Interviewer,And what are the this and the this and the this?
682.0,690.0,Subject,"Like the voices, the hallucinations, the feeling stuff that aren't there. "
690.0,693.0,Interviewer,[So I don't kind of really know about that?]. 
693.0,694.0,Subject,
694.0,695.0,Interviewer,So--
695.0,701.0,Subject,"Most of the times, almost all of the time, it's scary. But, sometimes, it's really funny."
701.0,702.0,Interviewer,Funny?
702.0,716.0,Subject,"Yeah. In the beginning, it's just really scary because you believe it's so real, right? But nowadays, you still believe it's real, but you kind of snap out of it quicker. "
716.0,719.0,Interviewer,So what kind of things do you think are happening?
719.0,746.0,Subject,"So in the beginning, it's like I remember I woke up. I was sleeping, and I woke up. And I just see three dolphins on my bed. My sheets are blue. So I guess maybe that looked like the water. I just see these three dolphins with the bloodshot eyes. They looked so aggressive. But I just started patting them, right? And they started making dolphin noises, and I just didn't know what to do so I made them back. "
746.0,748.0,Interviewer,Could you feel them?
748.0,761.0,Subject,"Yeah. They felt so soft. And it was like their skin was wet. But they looked really mean. But when I was petting them and stuff, they were like-- I don't know. I was really scared, though."
761.0,762.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I'm sure. "
762.0,782.0,Subject,"And then I think I fell back asleep, and I went to drink water. I went to use the bathroom, and then-- wait, I was going to drink water. And I don't know. I don't know. Now, I know that it was a cup I was holding because I saw the cup the next morning where I'd placed it. But at the time, the cup was a snake. "
782.0,783.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my gosh."
783.0,788.0,Subject,So it was like this big snake in my hand with its mouth open. I was holding it from the top so it couldn't turn and bite me. 
788.0,792.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk].
792.0,802.0,Subject,"And I think I was like, ""Mom. Mom. Look at the snake. Look at the snake."" And then I don't know. I guess it disappeared. And then I went into my room. And I just see hundreds of snakes on my bed. It was so scary."
802.0,806.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my God. What did you do?"
806.0,808.0,Subject,I don't remember. I think I just went to sleep.
808.0,810.0,Interviewer,And the snakes [laughter]?
810.0,811.0,Subject,Yeah. 
811.0,812.0,Interviewer,Man.
812.0,850.0,Subject,"But then after a while, the next time I hallucinated, I went to use the bathroom. And so the bathroom was right outside. You go to my room. So my room's here. I walk out, and I see the bathroom, right? But there's a kitchen on the left. So you can see the kitchen on the left when you go to the bathroom. And it was all in black and white, more like outlines. So I guess it wasn't as scary, but it was a dead goat's head on the kitchen table. There was blood everywhere. I just looked at it. ""There's no way there's a goat's head on my kitchen table right now."" So it was kind of funny. "
850.0,852.0,Interviewer,So you knew it wasn't there?
852.0,854.0,Subject,After a while. 
854.0,856.0,Interviewer,"After a while? So when you first saw it, you were like, ""Oh, my gosh""?"
856.0,860.0,Subject,"Yeah. I was freaking out. I thought, ""What?"""
860.0,863.0,Interviewer,That's so interesting. So a lot of them are animal-related. 
863.0,864.0,Subject,Yeah. 
864.0,866.0,Interviewer,That's interesting. 
866.0,869.0,Subject,But sometimes it's shadows or people. 
869.0,870.0,Interviewer,Other people?
870.0,893.0,Subject,"Yeah. One time, I hallucinated my uncle was actually in the basement watching cricket. And I know I did not talk to him because I talked to him about [inaudible]. I never came upstairs. So apparently, he came upstairs. I thought he came upstairs. And his eyes were red too. And normally, all these things, their eyes are really red. And we had a full conversation. But apparently, that never happened. "
893.0,896.0,Interviewer,Never happened. Do you remember what you talked about? 
896.0,905.0,Subject,"I think he was like, ""Come down to eat."" [inaudible] like, ""What are you doing? Do you want to watch TV?"" Stuff like that. "
905.0,910.0,Interviewer,Interesting. And so they don't scare you anymore?
910.0,914.0,Subject,"In the moment, they scare me, but I snap out of it quicker now. "
914.0,915.0,Interviewer,"What does that mean, snap out of it?"
915.0,921.0,Subject,"At first, it seems really real. Even though it sounds stupid--"
921.0,922.0,Interviewer,No. 
922.0,924.0,Subject,"It really does sound stupid, but--"
924.0,925.0,Interviewer,"No, it sounds scary. "
925.0,936.0,Subject,"Even though it sounds like-- there are no dolphins on your bed, right? But in the moment, it seems extremely real. "
936.0,941.0,Interviewer,It's so interesting that you can touch them too. It's not like they just go away when you--
941.0,980.0,Subject,"No. One time, I knew my sister was next to me on the left, right? I knew she was sleeping. But then I saw her again in front of my bed. So I kind of went like this with my foot, and she disappeared. So that's the first time I didn't feel it. Interesting. Does it all happen at night? No? No. My uncle, that one happened in the day. My sister, that happened in the day. But mostly, it'll occur at night. I guess it's when I'm by myself or I'm not doing anything, then it happens. "
980.0,982.0,Interviewer,And you said you hear voices?
982.0,985.0,Subject,Yeah. Those can be amusing sometimes too.
985.0,986.0,Interviewer,Really?
986.0,1009.0,Subject,"So, at first, it was really scary because I didn't know where it was coming from. In the middle of the night, I'd hear hundreds of footsteps in my kitchen, really heavy footsteps. I'd go in the kitchen-- and then I'm in the middle of the kitchen, and I still hear it, but I won't see anything. I took a belt from my room, and I'm swinging it around [laughter] the kitchen. There's nothing there. I just got fed up and went to sleep."
1009.0,1012.0,Interviewer,What are they saying exactly?
1012.0,1014.0,Subject,No. It was just a lot of footsteps. 
1014.0,1015.0,Interviewer,"No, when you hear the voices [crosstalk]?"
1015.0,1030.0,Subject,"But when I hear them, sometimes, they're-- oh, the amusing ones? So, normally, I read a prayer and glue it on my bed and stuff before I sleep. So I'm doing that, and then I hear a voice. ""Oh, that's not going to work."" "
1030.0,1043.0,Interviewer,"Oh, no. Sorry [laughter]. Oh, that's all you need [laughter]. Okay. So you pray quite a bit. "
1043.0,1046.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. 
1046.0,1050.0,Interviewer,"So are both your parents religious, your dad?"
1050.0,1059.0,Subject,"My dad is way more religious. My mom's definitely religious too. She prays five times a day. She wears her hijab. She didn't used to wear a hijab, but now she does. "
1059.0,1061.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that happened?
1061.0,1072.0,Subject,"So I go to a Muslim school. I used to go to a Muslim school. And in elementary school, I saw everyone else's parents. They were all wearing hijabs and stuff. I was like, ""Mom, how come you don't wear it?"""
1072.0,1074.0,Interviewer,"Oh, and she started?"
1074.0,1080.0,Subject,And then she started wearing it just to drop me and pick me up at school. And then she just started wearing it. 
1080.0,1099.0,Interviewer,Interesting. So what was it like going from a Muslim school and being pretty ingrained in that to going to Fordham?
1099.0,1105.0,Subject,I thought it would be kind of a culture shock where everyone talks about-- but it wasn't at all. 
1105.0,1106.0,Interviewer,No?
1106.0,1108.0,Subject,It was fine. Fordham is a very small school. 
1108.0,1109.0,Interviewer,It is?
1109.0,1117.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. You don't even have to have the classes with people, and you'll still see them every day. "
1117.0,1118.0,Interviewer,Good. 
1118.0,1123.0,Subject,It's a really good campus too. No one's really outside. 
1123.0,1125.0,Interviewer,"Oh, I'm thinking of the Lincoln Center campus. [crosstalk]."
1125.0,1127.0,Subject,No. I'm pretty sure there is more--
1127.0,1128.0,Interviewer,It's like [crosstalk].
1128.0,1135.0,Subject,I'm pretty sure Lincoln Center is more active. But they're also-- it's pretty good. But it's a pretty campus. 
1135.0,1138.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, it is stunning and so pretty. And it's close to the botanical garden."
1138.0,1139.0,Subject,Yeah. 
1139.0,1147.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]. So what are you interested in doing [inaudible] studying?
1147.0,1177.0,Subject,"At first, I wanted to be a doctor and go to medical school. Right now, I'm majoring in bio. But at the same time, I do not see myself in school for that long. And I also like math way more than science. So I'm thinking of-- so when I go back next semester, I'm going to take finance classes and stay premed just because I already need a science for the requirement. So it won't hurt if I stay premed for another semester. And I'll see how it goes and make a decision. "
1177.0,1181.0,Interviewer,And what brought you to finance?
1181.0,1183.0,Subject,I have no idea [laughter].
1183.0,1184.0,Interviewer,No?
1184.0,1212.0,Subject,"I don't know. I guess a lot of my cousins do it too. So I guess that's what drew me to it. But I mean, I'll see how the classes go. And if I want to do finance, then I'll have to-- because you can't just major in finance. You have to be in a [inaudible] school of business. So I'll have to apply there and then change my major. So if I want to do that, I'll do that. And if not, then I'll just stick to bio. "
1212.0,1217.0,Interviewer,And so why did you want to be a doctor?
1217.0,1229.0,Subject,I wanted to be a doctor since I was little because I have asthma. It really sucked going to hospital all the time and stuff. So I don't really want other kids to go through that. 
1229.0,1234.0,Interviewer,"Interesting. And your asthma, has it gone?"
1234.0,1236.0,Subject,"No, but it's not really a problem now"
1236.0,1239.0,Interviewer,Not anymore?
1239.0,1240.0,Subject,Maybe only in the winter. 
1240.0,1243.0,Interviewer,"And you play sports, right?"
1243.0,1246.0,Subject,Not anymore. I used to be on my high school basketball team. 
1246.0,1250.0,Interviewer,Why don't you play anymore?
1250.0,1253.0,Subject,I don't have the time now [inaudible]. 
1253.0,1261.0,Interviewer,"In college, it's more of a commitment. Why did you like basketball?"
1261.0,1266.0,Subject,I don't know. I guess I was always into it. 
1266.0,1277.0,Interviewer,What do you think that was about? Why did you--
1277.0,1301.0,Subject,"What, basketball? I guess because in [inaudible] school, we'd all play it. Me and my cousins would watch basketball together sometimes whenever we were together if there was a game on. Yeah, and I just like the sport, so. "
1301.0,1314.0,Interviewer,"Sounds like there's a lot of togetherness that comes with it too. You watch it with family, play it with your friends. What kind of things do you do with your friends now?"
1314.0,1338.0,Subject,"Well, I don't really go out as much now. But I don't know. We go out. I guess, sometimes, we go out to eat. Sometimes, it's a movie. It's mostly just us sitting around and talking and stuff like that. "
1338.0,1340.0,Interviewer,What do you guys talk about?
1340.0,1343.0,Subject,Stupid stuff [laughter].
1343.0,1345.0,Interviewer,Like what?
1345.0,1350.0,Subject,It's just completely random. We'll go from topic to topic and make jokes. 
1350.0,1356.0,Interviewer,And what kind of movies do you see?
1356.0,1363.0,Subject,"The last movie I saw-- I actually saw my cousin when I went up to Florida, and my sister. I think it was Lion King. "
1363.0,1364.0,Interviewer,Why were you in Florida? That's [crosstalk].
1364.0,1369.0,Subject,"Yeah. Oh, my grandparents live there, so we go every summer to visit them. "
1369.0,1374.0,Interviewer,"Oh, fun. That's nice. Is it a big family gathering?"
1374.0,1383.0,Subject,Not really. Just a couple of us. Maybe two of my aunts and some cousins and my grandparents. 
1383.0,1390.0,Interviewer,"So is it something you enjoy, [crosstalk]?"
1390.0,1394.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's good. It's a chill time. "
1394.0,1396.0,Interviewer,What do you mean chill?
1396.0,1413.0,Subject,"I was always in a good mood there. There was always something to do. Even if you're not going out and stuff, you go in the living room, there's always someone there. My grandparents are there. My cousins are there. Even if you're not talking, it's good company. "
1413.0,1416.0,Interviewer,And do you feel like it's different here? You don't get that here?
1416.0,1426.0,Subject,"No, I don't get that here because in Florida, most of my mom's side of the family is there. And New York, it's my dad's side, and they don't really get along at all. "
1426.0,1427.0,Interviewer,Your dad and his family?
1427.0,1429.0,Subject,Yeah. 
1429.0,1431.0,Interviewer,Why do think that is?
1431.0,1442.0,Subject,"They always have some kind of drama. That's why I don't really get to see my cousins a lot when I'm here. Me and my cousins get along, but because of our parents and stuff, we don't get to see each other. "
1442.0,1443.0,Interviewer,Really?
1443.0,1444.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. 
1444.0,1446.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] [laughter]. No?
1446.0,1447.0,Subject,Hmm-mm.
1447.0,1448.0,Interviewer,Why?
1448.0,1451.0,Subject,I don't know. Everyone listens to their parents. 
1451.0,1454.0,Interviewer,And your parents don't want you seeing them?
1454.0,1457.0,Subject,"No, they don't mind. It's just-- yeah, they have their say."
1457.0,1469.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk]. Interesting. But do you feel more-- you said you liked kind of the company there. Do you feel more alone here?
1469.0,1494.0,Subject,"In terms of family, my cousins and stuff, yeah. Florida is way better. I stopped my nighttime medicine, my anti-psychotics right before I went to Florida. So I guess even though I didn't have the anti-psychotics, the Florida trip boosted my mood too. I still heard voices and stuff, but they weren't as bad. My mood wasn't bad or anything. "
1494.0,1497.0,Interviewer,How long were you off them?
1497.0,1502.0,Subject,I think it's about three and a half weeks now. 
1502.0,1504.0,Interviewer,And so you're still not taking the one at night?
1504.0,1509.0,Subject,No. But I upped the anti-depressant. 
1509.0,1515.0,Interviewer,Right. [inaudible]. Is there a reason you didn't like the anti-psychotic?
1515.0,1518.0,Subject,I gained 30 pounds in like two months. 
1518.0,1521.0,Interviewer,Yeah. [inaudible]. 
1521.0,1527.0,Subject,"Yeah. And then I still have twitching over here, when I'm [inaudible]. "
1527.0,1529.0,Interviewer,It's still there?
1529.0,1537.0,Subject,"Mm-hmm. It didn't last for a long time. It's not as frequent, but it's still there. It happens."
1537.0,1538.0,Interviewer,But you're feeling good?
1538.0,1540.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. 
1540.0,1559.0,Interviewer,"That's good. And since coming back, do you feel like you would like to see more of friends? Do you feel any difference? Kind of back in Florida, it sounds like it was really positive. "
1559.0,1566.0,Subject,I don't feel like a change in my mood. But I know it was better in Florida. 
1566.0,1572.0,Interviewer,Do you think it was being with people a lot?
1572.0,1574.0,Subject,Yeah. 
1574.0,1577.0,Interviewer,So that's important to you?
1577.0,1578.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. 
1578.0,1590.0,Interviewer,"Is there a difference between-- I guess what's the difference between spending time with family and spending time with friends here? It, obviously, felt pretty different. "
1590.0,1602.0,Subject,"Yeah. I guess I'm more comfortable with my family. Even if I don't talk about anything, it's like-- my grandparents are so sweet. Yeah. "
1602.0,1604.0,Interviewer,How are they sweet?
1604.0,1615.0,Subject,"Especially my grandma. She's like, ""You know you can tell me anything."" But let's say you tell her something, she likes to worry about you [laughter]."" She's already so sick. "
1615.0,1616.0,Interviewer,"Oh, she's sick?"
1616.0,1619.0,Subject,"Well, she's getting better now. She had cancer. But she doesn't have it anymore. "
1619.0,1622.0,Interviewer,"Oh, did she? "
1622.0,1626.0,Subject,"But still all the chemo and stuff, what it does to your bones. "
1626.0,1636.0,Interviewer,"Oh, gosh. Oh, so that's quite a big part of your life, both sets of grandparents and--"
1636.0,1637.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. 
1637.0,1646.0,Interviewer,--[inaudible] cancer [inaudible]. Is that what affected you all?
1646.0,1653.0,Subject,"Hmm-mm. It made me down, but I prayed for them everything would be fine. "
1653.0,1664.0,Interviewer,And does praying bring you peace?
1664.0,1684.0,Subject,"I'm not quite sure, but I know it's like something to rely on. God's always there for you. It's someone to rely on. "
1684.0,1690.0,Interviewer,Do you feel you don't have that otherwise?
1690.0,1694.0,Subject,No. Not really. 
1694.0,1695.0,Interviewer,Not really?
1695.0,1709.0,Subject,"I mean, I guess, yeah. My parents. I don't know. We've bumped heads a lot. I think around it was like first semester. Yeah. "
1709.0,1710.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]?
1710.0,1735.0,Subject,I think the calming effect of alcohol and stuff. It was a really-- summer of 2018 was really bad. I got calm with [inaudible] [laughter]. Then I got calm with drugs. Then I pierced my ears without them knowing. I think then I got a couple more girls on my phone. So it was just a bad stretch.
1735.0,1737.0,Interviewer,And why--?
1737.0,1746.0,Subject,"So they were really mad. But nowadays, especially my mom, she's really chill, way cooler than my dad. "
1746.0,1752.0,Interviewer,And what do you think upset them so much about the girls and stuff? Why do you think [crosstalk]--
1752.0,1778.0,Subject,"I guess they thought like oh, I'm this-- I'm supposed to be this ideal Muslim boy. Girls are [wrong?]. They're bad. Not bad, but, ""Don't talk to girls until you're married."" Or, ""Drugs, don't do it."" But I mean, I learned the hard way that drugs are bad. "
1778.0,1787.0,Interviewer,What do you mean? Like weed?
1787.0,1789.0,Subject,Never smoked weed.
1789.0,1790.0,Interviewer,"Oh, so what?"
1790.0,1794.0,Subject,It's kind of like NyQuil and alcohol.
1794.0,1798.0,Interviewer,"So that made them worse, the symptoms?"
1798.0,1809.0,Subject,"Yeah. Not in the beginning. Maybe towards the end. The last time I used it, I noticed it, and I'm like [inaudible]. "
1809.0,1814.0,Interviewer,And so this was a new thing. Was this when you went to college?
1814.0,1820.0,Subject,The first time I had it was in ninth grade I think. But I didn't used to add alcohol to it. 
1820.0,1833.0,Interviewer,And so you were butting heads a lot. How did it turn out? How did it make you feel? How did that end up? How did it turn out?
1833.0,1846.0,Subject,"Yes, it sucked. But I don't really take things on. I mean, I don't ignore things. But I don't really take it to heart. I think about it. ""Okay, this is what it is, and that's it."" No use stressing over something. "
1846.0,1856.0,Interviewer,Good outlook. And you said your mom's pretty chill now. What do you think the [crosstalk]?
1856.0,1862.0,Subject,"I feel like it's blet's say you do something really bad, they don't mind something bad. "
1862.0,1870.0,Interviewer,It's like perspective. Do you think that's brought you closer?
1870.0,1873.0,Subject,Yeah. 
1873.0,1882.0,Interviewer,Do you feel you rely on her more now?
1882.0,1890.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, she's a big part of my life. My parents are a big part of my life. "
1890.0,1892.0,Interviewer,Even when you butt heads?
1892.0,1894.0,Subject,Yeah. I still love them. 
1894.0,1899.0,Interviewer,Nice. But you said that you don't really like to confide in them. 
1899.0,1900.0,Subject,Hmm-mm.
1900.0,1902.0,Interviewer,Is there someone that you confide in?
1902.0,1903.0,Subject,No.
1903.0,1904.0,Interviewer,No?
1904.0,1912.0,Subject,No. I'm trying with just my therapist now. Yeah. 
1912.0,1917.0,Interviewer,Is it something that you find hard to do or you just haven't had the opportunity to do?
1917.0,1920.0,Subject,"No, I find it hard to do. "
1920.0,1923.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that is?
1923.0,1931.0,Subject,Just that I guess it's just out of my comfort zone. That's all. 
1931.0,1932.0,Interviewer,Do you feel uncomfortable when you share things?
1932.0,1937.0,Subject,Yeah. 
1937.0,1943.0,Interviewer,How so? What do you feel?
1943.0,1952.0,Subject,It's not more the person hearing what I'm saying. It's about it coming out of my mouth. 
1952.0,1957.0,Interviewer,So you said you don't want to let it out of--
1957.0,1958.0,Subject,Yeah. 
1958.0,1962.0,Interviewer,What do you think will happen if you let it out?
1962.0,1969.0,Subject,I don't know. 
1969.0,1977.0,Interviewer,So it's not really about other people knowing things about you. It's about how it makes you [crosstalk].
1977.0,1982.0,Subject,It's about me knowing that I told someone else about me. 
1982.0,1987.0,Interviewer,So what's the worse that could come of that?
1987.0,1991.0,Subject,Nothing really bad. So I don't know why it's such a problem.
