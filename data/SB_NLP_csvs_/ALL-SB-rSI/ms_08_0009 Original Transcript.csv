0.0,5.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So I'm just going to start. Wayne, how have things been going for you lately?"
5.0,8.0,Subject,Lately? It can hear me. Right?
8.0,9.0,Interviewer,Yeah [laughter].
9.0,35.0,Subject,"All right. Lately, I've been all right. Mostly good. A little isolated. I mean, I'm good overall. I feel loneliness has been a constant throughout my life and I just felt isolated recently. But overall good, I think."
35.0,38.0,Interviewer,It's been a pattern in your life?
38.0,88.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think I realized recently that I--well, I always knew that I spend a lot of time alone. But I didn't realize, chronic loneliness can be very bad for you. And I didn't realize that it could cause physical symptoms and cause all these other things that I didn't know about. So I'm [doing?] a little bit about that. But yeah, it's been-- I spent most of my life alone, I think, on my computer. In high school, I didn't really hang out with people very often. Just went home. Yeah. So yeah, I have been thinking about that recently. "
88.0,95.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that's always been how you operated?
95.0,185.0,Subject,"So I broke my arms when I was eight or so. I fell off a cliff. And after that, my mom was a little over-protective. And that's right when all the family-- a lot of family turmoil and stuff was going on right afterwards. So I think I just kind of-- and I wanted to be the good kid, the quiet kid. So I just kind of stayed quiet. And I spent time alone in my bed while they were fighting. So I think it just started around then. And then I didn't do anything to stop it. So it just kind of continued until I started talking with a therapist. See, I think that's where it started from. And because of all that time spent alone, I think I have a harder-- I had a hard time voicing my emotions and stuff. I remember, in high school, there was this one time-- I forget what they asked me, it was something about when I was a-- my childhood in the past. And I wanted to say something. I was trying to say something, but the words just didn't come out. So yeah. "
185.0,187.0,Interviewer,Who is they?
187.0,218.0,Subject,"They were just some friends that I was-- senior of high school, I started to be more sociable, a little better. So I was having lunch inside a classroom with a couple people. So yeah. Uh, uh, uh, uh [laughter]. The way I talk [laughter]."
218.0,231.0,Interviewer,"No, that's all right. Okay. So do you think you enjoyed or enjoy being alone? Or is it something that just kind of happened to you?"
231.0,254.0,Subject,"I think it's a mixture. I mean, I do enjoy being alone now. I need a lot of alone-time. But I think that's just a product of all that time spent alone during my formative years. So I do enjoy it a little bit. What was the first part of the question? Sorry."
254.0,257.0,Interviewer,"No, do you think that it's something that you enjoy or something that happened to you?"
257.0,264.0,Subject,"Oh, something that happened? Well, yeah, I think it first happened to me and then I started to enjoy it. Yeah."
264.0,270.0,Interviewer,So you do enjoy it a little bit now but you feel like it's time for a change?
270.0,294.0,Subject,"Yeah. I feel like it's time for more of a change. I don't think I need that much alone-time. I think I've just been feeling isolated because-- I don't have very many friends. And one of them is busy with college, and the other one is away at college. And then, at work, I don't really connect with my co-workers, and I don't like them that much. "
294.0,295.0,Interviewer,Why not?
295.0,322.0,Subject,"Well, my boss is not-- he's just kind of old fashioned, casual bigot. It's nothing overtly but like, oh, my bag-- as we're walking out, I showed him my bag because I like the new bag that I got. "
322.0,323.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]?
323.0,506.0,Subject,"Yeah [laughter]. And he was like, ""Oh, it's [inaudible]. People are going to be like, 'Oh, that's [inaudible] [laughter].'"" And then, towards women, he's a serial cheater, and he has no remorse at all. And it's just hard having a conversation with him. And then I would always get into political arguments with him because he would talk about Joe Biden and how great Joe Biden is. And I've noticed that Joe Biden just kind of-- whenever I talk about it with him specifically-- after a while, I don't know, just get into a breaking point. So I don't like him that much. Yeah. I don't like him that much. And then my co-worker, John, is this very, very weird guy. Yeah. I mean, he's chilled out a little bit but the first couple days that he was around-- I think he's black. I think he's mixed. But anyway, the first couple days, he kept saying, in this country voice, the N-word with hard R. I guess it was funny to him but I just didn't know, what do I do? What do I do in this situation? But he stopped doing that. I don't know. I guess, he used to find that funny. But anyway, he's just very weird. I don't really connect with him. He doesn't eat sandwiches. He only listens to 2Pac. I mean, 2Pac's fine. He's a good artist. But I don't know. He's just very weird. Also, he doesn't work that well. Today, he just followed me around [laughter]. Well, not followed me around. But he went to places that I'd already done working, they were good. And then he just did tiny little cuts here and there. And then I feel like I'm the only one working sometimes and I'm just kind of cleaning up after him. So yeah.  And then my old co-worker, I like better, Brendan. But the left, unfortunately. So yeah. That's why I've been feeling isolated, I think. Because I can't connect with friends or people at work. I mean, I live with my mom. And she's cool. I've been warming up to her recently, which is nice. Our relationship is pretty cold. There's not very much physical contact. It was her birthday Sunday. I was working that day, so we didn't do anything. But I gave her a hug [laughter] yesterday, and it felt nice. I was a little, not fearful, but there was a sense of hesitation before I asked. But yeah, it's warming up a little bit. So that's nice. It's just always been kind of distant there with her."
506.0,508.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that is?
508.0,591.0,Subject,"Because, I mean, when I was growing up, there wasn't-- I don't remember if I wanted it to be that way, but there wasn't very much initiation of hugs or other stuff, that I remember. And during the time that all this family turmoil was going on, she was not handling it very well, just kind of crying a lot. Sometimes she would threaten-- she was just not handling it well. And yeah, I just-- and I felt bad at the time that I didn't feel anything when she cried after a couple years because it was just regular. So yeah, I don't know. It's just distant. And I mean, I'm that way with my dad too. But yeah, I think it's just from that experience. I mean, there's probably a bunch of other factors too and stuff. But yeah, it's getting better now, which is good."
591.0,601.0,Interviewer,It seems like distance is something that's bothering you a little bit. You're feeling a little bit isolated. You're warming up to your mother but it's still fairly distant.
601.0,604.0,Subject,Yeah.
604.0,610.0,Interviewer,What do you think bothers you about distance? Or it doesn't?
610.0,636.0,Subject,"Does distance bother me? Does distance bother me? I don't know. I mean, I have this instinctive need to keep a distance, keep a wall up. "
636.0,638.0,Interviewer,What does the wall do for you?
638.0,681.0,Subject,"It keeps me protected, for the most part. I mean, I don't think of it that way when I'm-- I mean, I feel like I don't think that much. I feel like I just act on impulses and instincts, for the most part. I mean, sometimes I overthink a lot. But I don't think that much. And my memory is very bad, it seems. I forgot what the question was exactly. But, yeah. What was it about?"
681.0,684.0,Interviewer,"So, I said, ""What does the wall do for you?"""
684.0,688.0,Subject,"Right. Yeah, mean it's just--"
688.0,689.0,Interviewer,You mentioned protection.
689.0,690.0,Subject,Yeah.
690.0,691.0,Interviewer,From?
691.0,739.0,Subject,"I mean, emotions are foreign. I mean, they're not foreign. They're not foreign to me, but they're more foreign than they should be. So it just kind of-- I don't know. It's hard to take in sometimes. Because I was a pretty blank slate for a while, and I felt fairly empty. So I don't know. So I feel like if I let the wall down, then it'll just be terrifying, all the potential emotions that would come in. Yeah."
739.0,744.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So what it is like, being a blank slate?"
744.0,774.0,Subject,"What is it like being a blank slate? I mean, you're just kind of moving through life, not really-- my dad called it sometimes zero effect. Because I mean, I wouldn't-- you don't feel very much. What is it? I mean, it's not good. "
774.0,779.0,Interviewer,What's the time when you're really noticed it?
805.0,810.0,Subject,"Sometimes, when I try to recall things, it's--"
810.0,811.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
811.0,833.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's like wading through mud or something. It's just very muddled. I mean, growing up, I think people described me as pretty cloudy. I don't know. It's hard to recall things. Yeah."
833.0,850.0,Interviewer,That's okay. And what do you think it would be like to experience all these emotions if the wall came down? What makes you scared of that?
850.0,904.0,Subject,"Well, I think the wall is just there. I don't necessarily like that it's there. But it's always been there. I would like for it to be down. Because when I feel-- when I date people or I feel things, it feels good. I like it. It's just, I don't know how to-- I think the process of getting that barrier down takes a while, completely. And I think I've made a lot of progress so far. But yeah. So I'm not really terrified of the emotions per se. But yeah."
904.0,909.0,Interviewer,So have you been able to let the wall down if you're dating or something?
909.0,960.0,Subject,"Yeah. I guess so. I mean, I'm very open now as opposed to how I was before, very closed off, kept to myself. I think part of it is because the first feedback I got on my emotions and thoughts or just, yeah, the first person I talked to really about personal problems was a therapist. So I just kind of dumped it all out at once. And it was a therapist, so it was met with good feedback. So I feel like I'm very open now, which is good. Yeah."
960.0,964.0,Interviewer,You think something positive has come out of being open?
964.0,993.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't feel like I have to hide anymore. Because I put on my Instagram that I have CPTSD, and that felt good. I deleted it. Well, I didn't delete that but I deleted my Instagram because I don't want that information out there. But yeah, I feel it has been good for me to be more open. Yeah."
993.0,996.0,Interviewer,So what is CPTSD?
996.0,1064.0,Subject,"So it's a series of traumatic events. Whereas PTSD would be a single traumatic event, this is multiple traumatic events often for prolonged periods of time. And it took me-- I didn't really understand that I had that until recently. Because I mean, my childhood wasn't dog shit. I mean, there were a lot of bad moments but it was only for a couple years. So I don't really understand how I could have this thing. But then I read about it, and if there are enough over a certain period of time, then you can develop the thing. Yeah. And it's got its own set of symptoms and everything that feel a lot better than PTSD did. Because I was diagnosed with that at 17, and I recently found out about CPTSD. So yeah. "
1064.0,1068.0,Interviewer,And it helped you to get that diagnosis?
1068.0,1108.0,Subject,"Yeah, it did, I think. Just so I can rationalize some of my behavior, make it make sense. If I could fix one thing, it'd be my memory. Yeah. I have to remind myself of things constantly and if I don't-- and yeah, I keep looking at the blue thing [laughter]."
1108.0,1110.0,Interviewer,"No, it's like a mirror with [inaudible]."
1110.0,1127.0,Subject,"Yeah. Got my hair cut recently for an interview. It's coming up in a week or so. Hopefully, I'll get in. It's a school for horticulture."
1127.0,1128.0,Interviewer,For what?
1128.0,1130.0,Subject,Horticulture. Study of plants.
1130.0,1131.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. Cool."
1131.0,1166.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I like this kind of field because I got into it because-- well, I didn't have anything to do because I'd left college. And then it's just very peaceful, working outside, especially with nature. And all the trees that I planted in the beginning are gone now. Because it's in a wildlife refuge, they pretty much let the plants do whatever they want. So if you don't trim the weeds when they grow, then they're not going to survive."
1166.0,1168.0,Interviewer,Do you do that now or some version of it?
1168.0,1208.0,Subject,"Well yeah, I'm a gardener now. There's a garden right around the corner. My company owns that garden. Though I don't work in there. I work in the Brooklyn, Queens section. It's a good job, I think. It's a good job. It'll end soon, which is good. Because there's not a lot to do now. There's not a lot. Yeah, because the gardens are all-- stuff is starting to slow down growth because it's fall and stuff. "
1208.0,1209.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It's winter coming.
1209.0,1275.0,Subject,"Winter is coming. I feel like it's going to be harsh. I don't know why. But I just feel like it's going to be harsh, kind of like dry summer, harsh winter. I mean, I hope it's not. But I don't know. I like the winter a lot. My dad took us all on a-- we would go on a winter hike every year. We have since I was little, or since my sibling were little. So we go, stay in a cabin in the Adirondack Mountains. It's pretty nice. I think I definitely like it more now than I did when I was younger just because if you take a bunch of people who don't like each other and you stick them in a cabin in the woods in a bunch of snow, it doesn't work out right. But it was still nice and I still like that. I would like to go back, maybe not with him, maybe by myself."
1275.0,1278.0,Interviewer,But so you will go back with him sometime?
1278.0,1332.0,Subject,"Probably not. Maybe not. Maybe not this one because I mean, I don't necessarily like hanging out with him but I do like the mountains. So I might just go by myself. Yeah. I mean, he's all right. Just I don't see any reason to spend time with him. I don't know. It just, I don't have any desire to. I feel like he's a lot hard-- my mom's a lot easier to forgive because she just couldn't handle it. Whereas he had a more active role. But yeah. So the mountains are cool."
1332.0,1335.0,Interviewer,And you might be going to school.
1335.0,1384.0,Subject,"And I might be going to school. That could be fun. I don't know. I'm pretty confident that I'll get in but I can't be 100% sure yet. But I don't have any other-- I'm kind of banking on it because I haven't made any other attempts to find other work or a school or whatever. But yeah. So I might be going back-- I went to college once, fresh out of high school but I left after a semester. Yeah, I left after a semester. But this time's different. Because it's 10 people. And also, I know what I want to do. And also, it's just a very different time in my life."
1384.0,1386.0,Interviewer,So you know what you want to do?
1386.0,1387.0,Subject,Yeah. I know what I want to do [laughter].
1387.0,1388.0,Interviewer,What is it?
1388.0,1432.0,Subject,"Well, definitely environmental work. I think I want to be a gardener for now. I want to be a-- one day, maybe be a national park service ranger. They are the guys who manage the refuge. And I always like them. Also, it's a very cool uniform [laughter]. So yeah. So maybe that. But yeah, I'm pretty sure I know what I want to do. Which I think will help me greatly in the interview. Because they want people who know who they-- they want good alumni, is what they want. And I think I'd be good alumni. It' going to be my birthday soon. I'm going to be 21. "
1432.0,1435.0,Interviewer,Yay. Here we go [laughter].
1435.0,1439.0,Subject,Unbelievable [laughter]. I can finally spend $30 on drinks in Manhattan.
1439.0,1440.0,Interviewer,That's quite nice.
1440.0,1474.0,Subject,"Whoo-hoo [laughter]. I don't drink very much. I do smoke a lot of weed at the moment. I feel like it mellows me out a little bit, makes it easier to talk to my mom, stuff like that. Also, I just have nothing better to do. I imagine I'll stop or slow down a lot once school starts because I'll be very busy. "
1474.0,1481.0,Interviewer,So you said it mellows you out [laughter]. What do you think makes you not mellow?
1481.0,1483.0,Subject,What I think makes me not mellow?
1483.0,1485.0,Interviewer,Or need mellowing out?
1485.0,1595.0,Subject,"Need mellowing out? I can get a little high-energy, like thoughts racing, pacing around, speaking loudly. And then I sometimes get a little angry at small things. Like I hit the wall today on my way out of work. It was over something tiny, my co-workers were just-- I wasn't sure if they hear me. Because sometimes I stay back and close up because there's a gate you have to close. And I wasn't sure if they heard me closing up. So I just feel like I can get a little-- yeah. And then sometimes, I get annoyed at my mom. Just various habits. But yeah, that's what I think. I mean, yeah. I've lost weight recently. I'm not very happy about it. Just my appetite has not been good. I think I'm on the way back up. Because I used to be--I've always been very skinny. But yeah. But I'm on the way back up, I think, gaining back the weight that I lost. I lost 15 pounds or something. "
1595.0,1598.0,Interviewer,So why don't you like that?
1598.0,1653.0,Subject,"Because I used to be-- I don't know. It doesn't feel very healthy. I just don't eat very often and it just doesn't feel good, I guess. And I used to be skinnier and people made fun of me a little bit for that. I had colicky stomach, when I was in middle school or something, just because I was-- I don't know. I didn't eat that much then either. See, I don't know. I just like to maintain-- not even the weight. I just want to maintain a good appetite and eat enough for the day. That'll be enough for me."
1653.0,1657.0,Interviewer,You feel like you're getting weaker? Tired?
1657.0,1691.0,Subject,"No [laughter]. No, I have plenty of energy. I can survive off very little food, it seems like. I don't think I should, but I could pretty easily. I mean, I still need food, but not that much to function properly. I need sleep. I need sleep. If I don't get-- if I sleep for-- if I sleep for two hours, then my body would just ache."
1691.0,1695.0,Interviewer,"Two hours, I think, is not sufficient for most human beings."
1695.0,1703.0,Subject,"No, it's not. But it feels weird because it's just one day. Is that normal for people? Their body feels--? "
1703.0,1704.0,Interviewer,Yeah. 
1704.0,1707.0,Subject,Okay. Okay. That's normal. Good. It's good to know [laughter]. Yeah.
1707.0,1709.0,Interviewer,Does that happen a lot?
1709.0,1720.0,Subject,"No, I usually get plenty of sleep. I try to get plenty of sleep. Sleep's great. But I'm a pretty early riser. Internal clock."
1720.0,1724.0,Interviewer,Sometimes good for gardening [inaudible] before the heat [laughter].
1724.0,1731.0,Subject,Yeah. Before the heat. So I'm very pasty.
1731.0,1733.0,Interviewer,Nice.
1733.0,1737.0,Subject,"Nice, nice. But I didn't realize I could get tanned like this. This is my first time."
1737.0,1738.0,Interviewer,And you didn't even burn.
1738.0,1786.0,Subject,"Well, yeah, I didn't even burn. Because I've been putting on sunscreen and stuff. I just never spent that much time outside or not as much time outside as gardening, because you're always in the sun. But it's a nice surprise. But yeah [laughter]. I was thinking about it on the way over, I feel like sometimes I can be a little disarming in my language. I mean, that's just my-- I don't know if that's reality. But it feels like-- it feels like that. I don't know."
1786.0,1791.0,Interviewer,Do people usually react in a disarmed way?
1791.0,1835.0,Subject,"I mean they usually laugh. Or not laugh every time I speak but they usually-- I can usually make people laugh pretty easily, I've noticed. And my dad has kind of a charm about him, and I kind of inherited his sense of humor. So it kind of makes sense. I don't think I'm intentionally trying to disarm people, but I don't know. It's just, people have always-- since I was young, people have always thought the way I talk was funny. Not necessarily the things I say. But I think they were laughing at me then. But it's okay [laughter]."
1835.0,1836.0,Interviewer,Does that bother you?
1836.0,1864.0,Subject,"I don't know. I don't remember. People have told me I was bullied. And it makes sense. It makes sense because I would go to school kind of dirty looking, with dirty shirts and didn't brush my teeth very often then. So it makes sense that I was bullied. But I don't remember a lot of it if it happened. I think it did happen."
1864.0,1866.0,Interviewer,So how did you find out? 
1866.0,1885.0,Subject,"I was just talking with somebody from middle school for whatever reason-- I think it was at high school. And she was like, ""I'm sorry about all the bullying, or something, that you had to go through."" And then I was just confused because I didn't remember that. Yeah."
1885.0,1888.0,Interviewer,Why do you think it makes sense?
1888.0,1891.0,Subject,Because I was very easily bully-able. 
1891.0,1893.0,Interviewer,I see. Yeah.
1893.0,1971.0,Subject,"I was showing up to school in hand-me-downs and fake Jordans and with stained shirts and, I don't know, a mop of hair. Also, I came to school one time-- I'm Jewish, and I came to school in-- I forget why. Some stupid reason, it was close to Halloween or something. Came to school with one of those-- you know, the thing you put around your neck, but the white and blue thing? And I brought a Torah and I was reading from the Torah in the schoolyard. So yeah. And I didn't have a lot of friends then either. And so I think I was-- and I would sit and read in the lunchroom. So yeah, I think I was bullied. I'm 99% sure. And in high school wasn't so bad as far as bullying. But I just kind of kept to myself there too. I mean, I guess, I've always been a quiet kid, even in elementary school. Yeah."
