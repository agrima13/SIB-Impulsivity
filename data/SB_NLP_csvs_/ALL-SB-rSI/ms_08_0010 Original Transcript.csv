0.0,6.0,Interviewer,"Okay, so the first thing I just want to ask is how things been going for you lately."
6.0,216.0,Subject,"It's pretty good. I'm in the middle of trying to get the special doctors pre-approval for my insurance company to change medicine. So that has also made me create a tighter schedule for my creative work and how to get things done before I go through a three-week process of changing my medication if that goes through. Because whenever you're changing meds, your mind goes blank for a couple of weeks. You're unable to be hyper creative or be deeply connected to memories or imagination. So there's just going to be a gap period where I can't work. So I'm trying to get all my work done now.  I think in three weeks I have a production of a short play I wrote a couple of weeks ago in response to Taming of the Shrew. It's a call evening in response to Shakespeare. And so this company asked me to write something. And then I think rehearsals are going to be in a couple of weeks. And because it's my last month in New York, I also lined up a few interesting shows. I'm seeing this experimental opera about high-tech spies in Casablanca-like romance on Sunday, with a composer/collaborator. And then I'm seeing the new Sarah Jones play and it's going to be at Live Arts. And a couple of things at the end of the month that I think could be very innovative just to see in terms of theater, like the New York City Ballet dances that they premiere every fall with special costumes and special compositions. And I think one of the choreographers is Asian this year, which they don't really have usually. So I think it'll be nice to see that. Yeah, so I have those things. And then right now I'm working on a romantic comedy. That was also going to be a coming-out story, not for me for the character [laughter]. And then I am working on finalizing a few things so that when I go to Chicago, I'll have a strong portfolio things. I won't have everything in progress. And so I have a pretty busy month of tidying up listens and stuff. Yeah, and then I am researching books to read on October for a new project that's going to be set in Elizabethan England. So I have some things. And right now I have some research books and then some things I'm reading for fun. I'm reading Edinburgh by Alexander Chee. I just read his recent collection of essays, how to write a autobiographical novel. And he talks about the origins of his first novel and how it took five years to get published because all the publishers or editors were like no one wants to read about a young, shy Korean boy. And that was the protagonist of his novel. It took five years to get it published, but that launched his literary career that he still has today. So I'm reading that book right now. And it's very heartbreaking because it's about a boy who wants nothing more than to sing, and his chorus teacher is a pedophile."
216.0,217.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh.
217.0,248.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's pretty dark stuff. But it's like very poetically written. It also has a lot of symbolism in it, and it's also about a close friendship that he has with another young boy. He doesn't warn the course master is a pedophile, and he doesn't report what the course master does to his friend. And his friend goes down a dark path and starts self-mutilating and eventually commits suicide. And that's all on the back of the book as well. So I'm not giving it away."
248.0,250.0,Interviewer,And what happened in the rest [laughter]?
250.0,312.0,Subject,"The rest of it, he becomes an adult, and he goes back to his town and he sees a kid that's a spitting image of his friend. And so he becomes haunted by his past. And that's where the story goes. So the beginning is just the process, I guess. And I'm in the beginning with the friend and he's already self-mutilating. So it reminds me of how when I was always in the library, when I was in middle school, I met someone who I was pretty sure was a pedophile. But the person that I thought was a pedophile actually would seem very tormented that he was one whereas this one, the one in the story, has a wife and knows how to keep his appearance up, and knows how to manipulate kids and get them to keep his secret. And he takes pictures of when he was born. Apparently, in real life he had of course drew pictures, naked pictures of the boys. He'd take them swimming and camping."
312.0,313.0,Interviewer,The author?
313.0,327.0,Subject,"The author is chorus teacher, real life chorus teacher. Yeah. So that was the inspiration for the book. But it took him a very long time to even tell anyone that this had happened to him. So"
327.0,337.0,Interviewer,"Wow, I can't believe that you've also have these friends of knowing someone. How did that come to be? You said it was in a library?"
337.0,434.0,Subject,"I was at a library and I was with my friends one weekend afternoon. And then they were like, ""Kate, there's a man who keeps staring at you."" And we were running around the library looking at magazines and giggling. And I saw this man who have very prominent lines on his face that looked like those really old-fashioned paintings of people in pain. He just had these lines on his face. And then I was at the library that whole week because my parents, both of them, worked. So I'd just go to the library to wait for them. And I was reading a book. And then when I looked up, the man was sitting right next to me. And he just looked very tormented. And this happened a few times that week. And then I looked at his book, and I realized his book was upside down. He wasn't really reading it. And I just ran to the librarian's corner. And then later-- not that week but later that year, there were some two parents who were very upset because they said near the library, a sex offender lived nearby, and he shouldn't be allowed to live near a middle school or a library. So I was lucky. But I just kind of knew. It was just like a weird sixth sense, which I think sometimes kids have when adults are weird. They just get a sense, like I should leave."
434.0,436.0,Interviewer,Wow. But how old were you?
436.0,438.0,Subject,I think it was like 12. 
438.0,442.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh. That's so scary.
442.0,451.0,Subject,"He stopped going to the library. Yeah. So I don't know where else he found people, but he stopped going that time."
451.0,461.0,Interviewer,Do you think it has stayed with you? Is that something that you think was a big thing in your life?
461.0,619.0,Subject,"I mean, I remember it. And I just remember it's like he seemed very tormented about his thing. And then there was that movie that came out when I was in college. I think it was little children with Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson. And it was based on a novel by Tom Perrotta, who later created that HBO show with Carrie Coon. I'm blanking on the name. But anyway, this novel is about this family and this mother and her son. And the son becomes the target of this pedophile, who wishes he wasn't a pedophile, but couldn't. And they show in the phone his complete English. I think he had also been hurting the kids. And he lived with his mother. And he was just like this guy who carved things. I mean, I don't have the greatest memory. But I just remember seeing the guy on screen and remembering the guy in the library. And I'm like, ""Yeah, they're both very conflicted people about that."" But not all pedophiles are like that. Some of them are teachers. So for instance, I had a drama teacher and he came my last year in high school. And he was very encouraging to me writing plays which I still do to this day. But I mean, I remember why I never took a drama class with him. But apparently a few years ago he got fired. And it came out he had been having sex with all these teenage girls at the school, and like one a year or something. And so there are all these lawsuits put against him, and he had to go to court. And then there was a whole controversy about whether he should be labeled a sex offender, or could he get off being in jail, but not being labeled that for the rest of his life. And there was a whole thing about that. So I don't know. I really didn't know that he was that kind of person. But I do remember when I was there he would hang out after school with a couple of teenage girls from the senior class, and I thought it was a little weird. But I was also like, ""Oh, some of my teachers are really cool. I wish they'd hang out with me."" But there was always that boundary, why would your teacher hang out with you after school? But he did that with a few teenage girls. And I guess, this was the beginning of his pattern. Yeah. So he has some lawsuits he's still dealing with."
619.0,621.0,Interviewer,"Oh my God, still."
621.0,628.0,Subject,"I don't know if he's labeled a sex offender but I think that was the thing the parents were trying, to get him labeled as that."
628.0,630.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I mean [inaudible].
630.0,644.0,Subject,"I think he goes after people who are 16 years old. Yeah. Which is I think, slightly different from me [laughter] because after 10 well, you're [inaudible]."
644.0,649.0,Interviewer,"Wow, I didn't realize how this is so much [inaudible] life. That's so [crosstalk]."
649.0,653.0,Subject,Just those two. But I was very lucky I was never really involved with them.
653.0,667.0,Interviewer,Exactly. Wow. Do you think that it's influenced your creative thought life? What do you think are your biggest kind of creative drive?
667.0,729.0,Subject,"Well, I think some people who are in my field are very obsessed with theater and know every nook and cranny of it but I didn't grow up doing theater. And I taught myself how to write plays. So I love the visual arts. I love music. I grew up trained as a classical musician and went to music camp. And everyone thought I was going to go to music school, and then I went to a regular University. And I think I take inspiration from the beauty of art and the ordinary things. So probably the best play I wrote-- actually, yeah, the best play I wrote, I sat in a museum and I was probably looking at art and talking about art. And then there's also Baroque music. They break into a song about art history and all this stuff. So that's the play that's getting read now."
729.0,734.0,Interviewer,That's so exciting. The way your work is alive in New York.
734.0,798.0,Subject,"Thank you. I mean, it's very hard, I guess, to keep it going. You really do have to meet people, and convince them to read your work, and they get so many plays. It takes a really long time. It took six to eight months to read this play. But the people who read it are like, ""I'll read anything you write or let's have a meeting."" But it's really long time. I think I wrote it in 2016. I finished revising it in 2017. And it's still being run. I mean, I think it costs a lot of money to find actors who can sing, and then let's do that. But I have the composer who already wrote the music for it. And we just worked on an opera together. So I wrote the libretto and he spent the summer writing, opera and now we have something. And that's where I try to get singers so we can record, and then try to get residency for that."
798.0,800.0,Interviewer,So what's a residency?
800.0,889.0,Subject,"So residency is when a theater or some kind of institution that supports artists gives you rehearsal space, and some music stands and some tools that you can block out and go to every day to work on your project in light. Sometimes you have to write a statement after the residency to talk about what you improved on in your piece. Or there's a showing like after two weeks, you have to present something to the producer, this is how far we got. But the residency is an official stamp of approval that someone believes in your project and wanted to give you time and space. And that makes it easier for you to get the next residency or the next grant. So that's why residencies can be important, especially in New York City. They just help legitimize the project. And I think it's also sort of a matter of copyright. People know this is your idea, you're working on it. So those are all reasons why people want residencies. And it's a great way to get good actors to work on your project because you're like, ""Hey, this institution is part of my project. Do you want to be on it for a week and just work together?"" Unless you're friends with the performer it's sometimes very hard to get them to just comment so you can hear your piece. It's much easier to get people to work on your stuff if you have something backing you."
889.0,906.0,Interviewer,Right. But it seems like you have such an impressive amount of projects going on in New York. And mind asking why you want to go to Chicago?
906.0,980.0,Subject,"I feel like I'm in a state in my career where it would be very helpful if I had a production somewhere but I don't know enough people in New York to get that to happen. I had hoped it would happen with the museum piece. But that actually faltered. There were people interested a couple of years ago, but just like politics, it didn't happen. So I'm trying to just expand regionally. And my parents are in Chicago. I don't know if it's ultimately going to be good. I think Chicago is very tight-knit and they are making scene. But I just thought, well, I have people I know in Chicago who are a support system. I could just try to make out for a year there and see how it goes, a year or two. I don't know maybe it'll take a year to get to know people and a second year to work there. But I was like, if the most of important thing to you is making art and you're not getting to make it New York because you don't have an agent or you don't have enough directors who have their own theater company and want to produce your work, then maybe going to Chicago where it's smaller but your work would stand out more, to try to work there for a little bit."
980.0,985.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]. And when would the residency--?
985.0,1007.0,Subject,"If my composer/collaborator gets a residency, I will get a plane ticket and fly back for the week to work on it. But I think it's going to be not until the spring or even in the fall that we have something because a lot of applications aren't until the spring. So I don't have to worry about that for this year. I just have to focus on the plays I'm writing."
1007.0,1009.0,Interviewer,Perfect.
1009.0,1130.0,Subject,"I'm so excited. I mean, I wrote a lot of fiction before I taught myself to write a play. But I think the thing that was most amazing to me was that when you write prose, you probably don't hear your work out loud for a really long time. But in play is like the point is for someone to speak in. And there's something really amazing about working with a group of people who have memorized your words or are studying your story and trying to put together a set and everything. And that doesn't mean you have a lot less creative control and you're vulnerable to their imaginations and desire of other people what they want. But at the same time you get this amazing group of people who all believe in the story and are all bringing it to life in a way that, I think, is something fiction can't give you.  I don't know. It was like a drug when it happened. I got produced. My first play got produced in college my freshman year. And then someone was like, ""Oh well, if you like writing plays you should study with this teacher,"" and I studied with that teacher for four years. And I still keep in touch with her. I saw her in May. We have lunch. But she's incredible. She's one of the most amazing people I've ever met. And one of the most brilliant and I just thought all playwrights were like her. And I was like, ""Oh well, if all players are like her, then I want to be a playwright too."" But she remains the most incredible person I have ever met. So [laughter] I think it's just her but she made me a playwright as well."
1130.0,1137.0,Interviewer,What do you think makes her so incredible?
1137.0,1245.0,Subject,"She could have a conversation with anyone. And I remember she always started class talking about a conversation she had with someone at the gas station or wherever she was going. And she would always be very interesting. And I was just like, ""Wow, if she can just talk to anyone,"" but in a really gifted-storytelling way. And she always was researching for ever plays because she has a lot of history plays. And I also thought to ask her, ""Oh, that's so great that you can always read other books in order to write your play."" I thought that was nice. And then she just had a brilliant way of connecting the contemporary with history. And she had a strong sense of just what was in the site guys, and she also watched over the phone and knew a lot of actors and their careers. I mean, I don't know, it was all stuff that was very appealing to me at the time. That is still kind of appealing now. But she just had a combination of [Rob?] brilliance and she made collaboration sound so beautiful. And I know not every collaboration she's had has been easy. And I think that meant something to me to know that someone as brilliant and as charismatic as her could struggle in a collaboration for a play. It's hard for every writer. But when it actually works it's so magical that it makes all the struggles worth it. I mean, you have to view it that way otherwise, you wouldn't do it. So I don't know. She's just very, very well read. Every year I give her a collection of books that I've decided are very good that were just published and I curated for her. And I try to make it so it's not something she already owns. I don't know."
1245.0,1252.0,Interviewer,That's a nice tradition. How did that start?
1252.0,1270.0,Subject,I don't know. I had a study office job when I started doing that. And I don't have a steady office job now. But I think it just gives me pleasure to do that for her. Every year for Christmas I just put it together.
1270.0,1289.0,Interviewer,What are your hopes for Chicago? What are you hoping to be different than New York? What are you hoping for creatively?
1289.0,1389.0,Subject,"Well, I kind of lost my sense of optimism the last year in New York and I had to experience some theater politics that were pretty unfortunate and colored my mood for a lot of the last six months. And I just was like, ""I need to be in a place where I don't have to deal with so many politics before my work has even been birthed,"" like the things I was working on. And so I was like, ""I just need to work in a different environment and see if I can regain the optimism that made me want to be a writer."" It stopped being fun and felt like all I was hearing were other people's opinions of me and my work. And I started to feel less and less like I had a voice even though it's making so many things. So I was like, ""I don't think this is healthy right now."" And I also got really sick. The stress from that triggered a psychotic episode. So I was like, ""I need to be somewhere where I can stay healthy and work and see what can really happen."" And my mom has read some of my stuff and visiting me a lot the past six months, she sees how much I work. And she was just like, ""You have more talent than I have had something. And you should make something up your turn."" So she welcomes me to go stay with them and save money."
1389.0,1390.0,Interviewer,And [inaudible] support.
1390.0,1446.0,Subject,"Yeah. Which is really nice. I mean, artists are unpredictable. Who knows, maybe after a year I'll be like, ""I need an office job and I can't do plays anymore."" I mean, I might even say that. I don't know. But at least I will try in a different city. I mean, I love writing plays and I got some feedback this past weekend. I submitted to two different places, one in London and one in Minneapolis, which is a National Fellowship. And they were like, ""Your play is great. It's experimental and formalist. Unfortunately you weren't specific enough in how we could help you succeed with your play. So we have to pass."" And I was like, ""Okay."" I have to have a better frame for expressing that otherwise people won't know how they can help me."
1446.0,1459.0,Interviewer,"That seems like a good position to be in. Like your work is good. It's just how they can help you, right? It's even more about making things better for you."
1459.0,1488.0,Subject,"Which I'm really having a hard time thinking in that way because I don't have the same optimism I used to have. I mean, maybe optimism is different as you get older. But just I had more pluck. And now I think I'm a little dry, which is not good for you. Yeah. "
1488.0,1504.0,Interviewer,"When we first started talking, you were talking about how when you change your medication, it can really stifle your creativity and your creative process. What is that like?"
1504.0,1585.0,Subject,"Well, I've been on a meager for, I think, maybe eight years now. But I remember I was really, really blank the last time I changed my medication. And my cousin's wife is a PCP and I was just sitting at the table really, really quiet. And I said, I'm sorry, my mind is completely blank. And she's like, ""That's normal. It always takes two to three weeks when you're changing meds. That happens to all my patients."" And that was helpful for me to hear her say that because I didn't feel-- because when it happens, you're like, ""Oh, no, I'll never be a person. I'll just be like this."" And it really does take like two to three weeks and then you start to feel like you get more access to your emotion and stuff because the medication, at least the one I'm on, it kind of suppresses some of your more negative emotions. And so it just takes a while for your brain to connect to everything again. It's going to be wired differently on the medication. So while I'm nervous about that two or three weeks, I've heard a lot of good things about this medication, Vraylar. And I'm hoping that it can really help me stay connected to the emotions in my chest which right now feel kind of blocked on a really high dosage of Invega."
1585.0,1588.0,Interviewer,And what emotions are in your chest specifically?
1588.0,1693.0,Subject,"I usually feel like a lot of things here or historically have my entire life. But I recently in April changed my medication to two milligrams more than it used to be or three milligrams more. And after that happened, my emotions are a lot more muted. Like my abilities to feel joy, or deep pain, or general happiness. It just feels very stifled. And I don't know if it's traumatic responses. Like that's what happens after you've experienced trauma, because I was assaulted in February, so I don't know if it's because of that, or the medication is doing that. And if I was on different medication I'd feel more, I don't know yet. But we're trying to see if we can do whatever the pre-approval thing with a doctor so that my insurance company will pay for it because it's a new drug. So it's really expensive if you don't have--. And then also in February while I was in Morocco, in addition to the assault, I also was drugged with something that gave me memory loss and affected my language center. So it took like two months for me to regain my memory and my speech and stuff. I don't know."
1693.0,1694.0,Interviewer,So scary.
1694.0,1724.0,Subject,"It was really scary. I didn't know if I was going to get better. I didn't know what I had been given, but I just couldn't really-- I couldn't write, I couldn't work. And yeah, it took like two months. And then I slowly started to recover. But it wasn't until I did the Mount Sinai exercise trial that my cognition sort of improved and I started to feel more normal."
1724.0,1726.0,Interviewer,Did that help?
1726.0,1727.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, it really did."
1727.0,1728.0,Interviewer,That's incredible.
1728.0,1733.0,Subject,Yeah. So I go to the gym now just to-- yeah.
1733.0,1738.0,Interviewer,Great. That Morocco trip sounds so--.
1738.0,1740.0,Subject,"Bad [laughter]? Yeah, it's really bad."
1740.0,1741.0,Interviewer,For lack of a better word.
1741.0,1743.0,Subject,Was literally the worst.
1743.0,1745.0,Interviewer,So what brought you to Morocco?
1745.0,1774.0,Subject,"I had this writing residency, but I had to leave early because I had been drugged. So I couldn't write. And they had to contact my mom. Yeah. I mean, they did perform my play [laughter], sorry. I got to meet the actors, but I got worse every day until I couldn't-- I wasn't even at the performance."
1774.0,1775.0,Interviewer,"Oh, no."
1775.0,1791.0,Subject,"Yeah, I wasn't. I didn't want them to see me like this. But they were great. Those Moroccan students who did it were great. And it was really nice to see them connect to a play about 1934 fascism in Vienna, Austria. So that was really nice."
1791.0,1792.0,Interviewer,Awesome [laughter].
1792.0,1827.0,Subject,"Yeah, that's great. Yeah. And then I was also at the Tangier airport-- don't fly through Tangier airport. It's like a great drug port. But anyway I was also pinned as a potential drug mule when I was in Tangier. So that was awesome going on. And apparently a lot of their shipments go through Madrid and so like I was being followed in the Madrid airport. But I could barely think properly and so it was really scary, all the stuff."
1827.0,1830.0,Interviewer,Gosh. And that was separate from the assault? Okay.
1830.0,1859.0,Subject,"Yeah, separate. I don't know if it was. I don't know. It was the worst. My parents don't know the whole thing. They just know I was drugged with something, but they don't know about this all and they are not sure about the drug mule thing. They sort of think it might have happened, but they also think you were really sick. What do you know? But literally there were two men following me. One of them was just like, ""We want you to be a drug mule."" I'm like, ""I'm not going to be a drug mule."" "
1859.0,1861.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh. That's crazy.
