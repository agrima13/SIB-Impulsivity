0.0,6.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So I'll start off just, how have things been going for you lately?"
6.0,9.0,Subject,Not too bad.
9.0,10.0,Interviewer,Not too bad? 
10.0,11.0,Subject,No.
11.0,15.0,Interviewer,What kind of things have you been doing recently?
15.0,17.0,Subject,Keeping it busy.
17.0,18.0,Interviewer,Keeping it busy? What does that look like?
18.0,33.0,Subject,"Lot of programs. I'm doing programs, seeing my doctor, my counselor at the hospital, and my other counselor, my helper. So I guess, seeing a supportive community."
33.0,36.0,Interviewer,And so what kind of programs are there?
36.0,39.0,Subject,I go to Fountain House.
39.0,40.0,Interviewer,And what exactly is that?
40.0,216.0,Subject,"[inaudible]. It's a house, they help you with your disability. And just, you go there, I don't know, you have a unit. It's five different floors. Each floor is called a unit, and it's a small community. And you're doing your work, your personal work, or you help around as teamwork within that particular floor any tasking, any small duties, cleaning, doing data entry, following up with any absent students that haven't come in throughout the day or the week or month. We celebrate birthdays of each of the members. So it's just helping and showing support and showing the unit goal education is dedicated for those of the members who want to go back to school, get a certificate, or continue their school and get an education in either college or finishing their GED, also work-related and stuff like that. And we sometimes go to a different unit, have meetings in our unit. In the morning, you come in and before you leave, at 3:00 P.M., we have general meetings, discussions what was the goal of the day or for the week. They provide us a meal, a small breakfast, small lunch, buy snacks.  A lot of things going around other activity outside Fountain House like open mic. Or we have a garden and enjoy seeing-- we have a garden, and they sell-- it's a garden for Fountain House. And we go to-- I guess, I will go again in December. I want to go. I always go there in the winter. It's sort of messy. I work for the summer, and they grow vegetables and fruits and some plants. And so it's part of the-- what's it called? Garden, it's in the first floor, when you first walk in, down stairs, small staircase. It's like a medium-sized room. They have all types of plants, and they sell it very cheap with low pricing. There, they have their own meeting. They have their own activities going on for the day to entertain [inaudible] but just spend time hanging out, meet the people, or help with the people, help yourself in your goals. So every unit has their own different daily small activities going on to keep me busy."
216.0,217.0,Interviewer,Got you.
217.0,279.0,Subject,"Yeah. So that's about it. That's what I do. I go to Fountain House three times-- depending what are my needs and how I'm feeling, how I somehow go throughout the day that's how I plan it. So there are one or two times or three times sometimes in a week. Oh, and yeah. They have a small team upstairs and they do tours in new enrolled members. And they have a small tour of one person already enrolled and prospective member. And then you already, a new person coming in, ""What is the camp-- what is the program about?"" And stuff like that. And that's what I do. And then, besides, I go to my psychiatry counseling appointments. I'm trying to go back to school to pursue my master's. I have a bachelor's, now I just need to do my master's which has been so stressed out. I got me emotional [inaudible] frustrated."
279.0,281.0,Interviewer,You're frustrated? What do you mean by that?
281.0,315.0,Subject,"Well, when I graduated, I went through a [inaudible] and I felt like school wasn't that much [laughter]. I wanted to do it but I felt it's so hard because it's competitive challenge. And I was the first generation to graduate from college, and you have not that much emotional, academic support, could be a little more challenging in the university. So Fountain House is a way of-- opportunity, a kind of small helping me get there. "
315.0,320.0,Interviewer,And it provides that community of support.
320.0,357.0,Subject,"Yes. Some type of way I would have to look for me and [inaudible] for me and stuff like that. And so yeah, that's my goal. I want to become a certified teacher, university teacher for the type of [inaudible] disabilities to being challenged or none also. Not specifically mentally, but those students also challenging emotionally and socially and politically in different aspect of life."
357.0,362.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And what inspired you to want to be a teacher?
362.0,470.0,Subject,"Yes. Mainly it was my college professor. We share the same socioeconomic background, experience. And he was there, very supportive out of all my other college teachers or educators. And he was mainly there for me, looking after me like a father, a mentor. Close relationship we had as a one-on-one student and a teacher. And I learned from him, and I heard his testimonies. And I was like, ""Wow, he pushed me to move on to the next step, to aim highly academically."" And that kind of made a difference in my life, who I am today. And also, I had high-school teachers also inspired me, some of them, pursue an education. Because I went to school. I dedicated all my heart to school when I was in high school. I demonstrated academic achievement. So I just want to-- I like working in the school environment. And I'm very conscious of where the students that are coming from the same background, and sometimes they don't have the support, just a little support, somebody to push them in a positive way, somebody they can look up to. Especially, I kind of want to provide that type of encouragement for them."
470.0,473.0,Interviewer,Just like that professor did for you. To pay that back.
473.0,495.0,Subject,Yes. To make a positive difference in life. Not to a point that you don't make mistakes that could be regretful or tarnished in your life. Caring about that [laughter].
495.0,507.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And from Fountain House and all this, it sounds like a community of support, whether you're providing that in school or-- that's something that's very important to you."
507.0,516.0,Subject,"Yeah. I also wanted, since I was small in school, [inaudible]. I kind of like working with school."
516.0,521.0,Interviewer,And what is it about the environment that you do like?
521.0,626.0,Subject,"It's like in that age, you're going through a lot of changes in life and you try to find yourself, you're trying to find yourself of who you are. And most of your teen years, you spend a lot of hours in school. So it's like you influence a young kid into adulthood. They're holding on kind of decide, ""Who am I going to be in society?"" So I feel like those things are important in life. And if you have that extra support, somebody looking out for you, that's very important, that's very crucial. And they're kind of [inaudible] problems of society problems, whether it's drugs or who you want to be in life, if you're going to be in jail or you're going to be out in the streets doing negative things or hurting others, it shouldn't be like that. It should be that you're living a [inaudible] life or having food to provide for your family or to depend on yourself in society. And I feel like some kids, they don't have to suffer. I could be there so they could be better from what I've gone through, they could be better person in society, and they don't have to follow their parents' hardship or my hardship, that sort of experience in the city. Making a difference in somebody's life counts."
626.0,631.0,Interviewer,And is there a specific kind of teacher you'd want to be?
631.0,659.0,Subject,"Yes. I don't discriminate, but I would say all subject for mental disability student population or social studies, like history teacher. That was my background, well, what I was majoring in college. And also, I could do Spanish or bilingual population. So those three different subject areas."
659.0,662.0,Interviewer,And what was your major in college?
662.0,664.0,Subject,It was history.
664.0,665.0,Interviewer,History?
665.0,669.0,Subject,Yeah. My back study is current event studies.
669.0,673.0,Interviewer,And what was it that appealed to you about history?
673.0,774.0,Subject,"I just learning things that happened in the past, the present [inaudible], and also the future, and how us humans, we have moved on. How we started from one place and everything have evolved throughout history and how we are-- we are partly held accountable for the wrong things we have done in the past and things that we done or accomplished or being influenced. Just looking how through different stages and years the society changed and in what way we have influenced that. And also learning from past mistakes and different things we have done in the past. And finding ways on how can I connect with them or how can I make society or life better? It kind of interests me, the different phases, stages of life we have gone through [inaudible], experienced. Yeah. Kind of their journey, life experience that one person experienced in life with others in the classroom, finding ways and solutions to make them more human or kind of make-- sounds interesting to learn."
774.0,788.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So are you kind of thinking about taking more classes to become a teacher? Or what does that process look like?
788.0,856.0,Subject,"The process is possible to complete. It's a program to help you. It's tuition almost free. You don't have to pay much from your own pocket, because [inaudible] stipend or scholarship. And once you complete the process they help you. You could teach. You could [serve?] as a student teaching. You could go to school and get guidance and direction from your coach teacher or your university coach teacher also. You can work in the school with the kids and everything, gaining the experience and all the necessary resources you need to go so you could be a [inaudible] teacher while you are working. You're going to school and you also complete your master's program in one of the colleges, which is expensive. But they're going to help you financially get that out of the way."
856.0,859.0,Interviewer,Gotcha. And so is that something you think you're starting on soon?
859.0,926.0,Subject,"Yeah. This is a goal that I wanted to reach since I was in college. It didn't work out. I don't know. Tons of [inaudible] happened in my life, challenges and [inaudible] the support sometime. I kind of felt a little bit down. Things happened. And now I want to do it and also I kind of pause. I mean, I do it and I suffer because I was not doing much. So now I say, ""Okay, the Fountain House with people's help and stuff like that, now a community which is supportive, I'm going to go for it and accomplish what I have to accomplish at least, finally in my life."" I've been putting off to this time. I'm like, ""Okay, I cannot be going on like this forever."" And I make a change in my life soon. And this is the time to do that now."
926.0,933.0,Interviewer,And are you finding that Fountain House is being-- the support that you get there has been helpful with that?
933.0,970.0,Subject,"I mean, there's other program. I'm also looking for more help, more open doors, more possibilities, opportunity for me to get that pretty soon. Because time goes, and we grow older. And I feel like I don't want time to pass over my head because I'll be like, ""Wow [laughter], I never got what I wanted to be or what I envisioned myself to be as a young kid. Why it took me so long to do it?"" I want to take advantage of that time now because there's other students that need my help too."
970.0,986.0,Interviewer,"And so these challenges that you're trying to work through, do you think that there's other things outside of Fountain House that are helpful for you?"
986.0,1030.0,Subject,"Yeah. They have big housing or applying for housing because as a student you have to have a peaceful place, a [warming?] place, so you can dedicate more time to your studies and your mental health and well-being, which is so crucial in the city, especially when there's many things going on at once and the challenge you have to face through every day because it's tough, especially when you feel like you're limited economically, and you have [inaudible] all the time, find out other programs, like find a way to release my stress, to stay physically in a more stable [inaudible]."
1030.0,1033.0,Interviewer,In a more stable--?
1033.0,1057.0,Subject,"Mentally, spiritually sane. Because sometimes you coming from a low income community background, there's many negative things you see out there. It kind of affects you, kind of unstabilizes your peace of mind, this type of thing."
1057.0,1068.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Are those the challenges that you're kind of talking about with the Fountain House and what it is that you're trying to work through, that inner--?"
1068.0,1069.0,Subject,Yes.
1069.0,1072.0,Interviewer,And could you tell me a little bit more about that?
1072.0,1075.0,Subject,What? I'm sorry [laughter]. About those challenges?
1075.0,1079.0,Interviewer,"About, yeah, those challenges that you're working through."
1079.0,1089.0,Subject,"Yes, for example [laughter], about challenges with people?"
1089.0,1095.0,Interviewer,What it is that you're trying to work through with Fountain House.
1095.0,1111.0,Subject,Yes. Mainly it's my educational goal and also personally and professionally become a better citizen of this country.
1111.0,1113.0,Interviewer,And so they focus--
1113.0,1122.0,Subject,I have more possibility in the world than what I have now. Self-improvement is very important.
1122.0,1128.0,Interviewer,And so they don't focus on the internal feelings? They focus on finding jobs and--
1128.0,1250.0,Subject,"No, they do. No. It's mostly, they search you for who you are, for your disability. We have workshops and meetings. We talk about ways to better yourself internally. And, for example, they have workshop about mental challenge, for people with schizophrenia, any mental anxiety, schizophrenia, all these different disorders that people feel, they talk about ways to cope with your challenges or anything in life in general. If you're dealing with family problems or social problems, skills, we discuss among us, a small group of community, in meetings. We talk about that. Or we have special [inaudible] in the art way, especially in our [inaudible] writing, we do painting, different ways, different avenues where you self-- freely express yourself and how you're feeling, and then you can relieve all that stress and move on to the next stage you want to take, next goal. What I know from what I have worked on, and move on to the next one [inaudible] about your own self, also your body as a person. It's cool. It's stuff like that, that we have. There's different activities, [inaudible] that they do try to focus on. Yes."
1250.0,1254.0,Interviewer,And have you met people through--
1254.0,1255.0,Subject,Fountain House?
1255.0,1256.0,Interviewer,Fountain House?
1256.0,1319.0,Subject,"Yeah, I mean, the members that have been there for longer than I, I kind of know most of the people. Most of the members there, the staff, I kind of got close to who they are Who they are and what's their purpose there. So yeah, I recently met a new person. [inaudible] person, and we had a meeting with him this last week. I believe it was Wednesday, this week. Stuff like that. I meet other members from other unit. For example, some of the members, they come from the-- I'm in the third floor. Some members are in the second floor, fourth floor, and they have a small music band and we [inaudible] with them, trying to song along with their rehearsal and learn the guitar. Yeah, it's not bad."
1319.0,1327.0,Interviewer,Do you have a favorite activity between painting and guitar and all the different options they have there?
1327.0,1374.0,Subject,"I guess the guitar, because I've been trying to learn the guitar since I was a young teen in my own country where I was born. And I never really had a chance to do that here when I was in school because either the funds wasn't there, I didn't know much information. So I was like, ""Oh-pa."" Now I know more resources and information, so I'm taking advantage of that. And learning the guitar is something-- I actually may learn another instrument, or even get better and be able to perform or play on my own time and stuff."
1374.0,1382.0,Interviewer,"And other people in Fountain House, have they gone through some pretty similar things to you? Or is it people from all over?"
1382.0,1408.0,Subject,"No, they've gone through the same challenge and the same experience and the same little life [which?] we go through. [We got?] people, in the way, as I am. They have to deal with things of life every day."
1408.0,1413.0,Interviewer,And do you feel like you can learn from them or teach them?
1413.0,1436.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's what that is all about, encouraging others and hearing others' stories or serving others. You don't talk to them. You're not personally connecting with them. But that's why this is a learning community, so we go both ways."
1436.0,1491.0,Interviewer,"And outside of Fountain House, are there people that you see a fair amount? Or is that your main community? Yeah, I see other people outside of Fountain House. I have regular friends. They have a background in teaching. They're coaching me, they're helping me. And especially now through these passes too, they have helped me with the pass. Now I'm going through this process, so I'm trying to reach out to them when I need questions regarding my process of application about the job and stuff like that, advice or any small discussion of any ideas and stuff like that, I'm able to contact them and reach them. And what sort of things do you guys do when you all get together? Is it mostly about teaching or are there other activities that you're up to?"
1491.0,1537.0,Subject,"All activities. We eat together and cook together. We listen for music. I have a friend from the music class, he was [inaudible] we went to his old friend's studio, his buddy, and he come here [inaudible] for my first guitar recently for this class. And if anything I want to say to him about how I'm feeling, how is my day going, I kind of talk to him. Talk to him about any questions about anything we learned in class. I talk to him too."
1537.0,1539.0,Interviewer,And so he is really there for you.
1539.0,1540.0,Subject,Mm-hm.
1540.0,1542.0,Interviewer,That's good. That sounds like a--
1542.0,1543.0,Subject,Any time. Yeah.
1543.0,1546.0,Interviewer,A good community of support in and out of Fountain House.
1546.0,1557.0,Subject,"Yes. That is very important [laughter] because being alone in the city could be a little bit eh, not a good taste."
1557.0,1558.0,Interviewer,Not a good taste?
1558.0,1583.0,Subject,"No. It's harder because it's like, okay, to who you go to [laughter]? Who's going to help me go through this, in a way? I'm pretty smart enough to be able to maneuver myself around but sometimes you need people. Or it's just, ""Okay, I need to stop now [laughter]."""
1583.0,1584.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1584.0,1589.0,Subject,"[It's harder?] for me to be, now I need a little bit extra help."
1589.0,1596.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. But it sounds like you are good at seeking people out and recognizing that.
1596.0,1622.0,Subject,"Yes. Well, I have learned. I learned the hard way [laughter]. You need to because they could be your guidance because they're older and they've been through similar-- they already know that. So it's like, ""Okay, they know how to [inaudible]. They have strategy [laughter] to respond."" Whereas me, I'm like, ""Okay, I need a little bit help here."""
1622.0,1627.0,Interviewer,And have you always been good at seeking people out?
1627.0,1647.0,Subject,"Yeah. I try at least one or two people there for me. I mean, along the way, they are older, from school. Yeah, I try to [inaudible] [laughter] at least one person. And sometimes it doesn't work out, but I try to have somebody there for me."
1647.0,1650.0,Interviewer,And has that been ever since you were very young?
1650.0,1681.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [laughter]. I know this [inaudible] be like, ""What?"" because sometime out of town, I'm not really a person people. I don't have a lot of people looking for me, which I realized. I wish I was [laughter], I had. But we have ourselves. But along the way, I keep people around. People move on. I meet other people. I say, ""Okay. I'm not losing much [laughter]."" These little things make a difference in life, believe it or not."
1681.0,1692.0,Interviewer,"And is it a lot of the same people that have been there all along? Or is it different stages of life, different people?"
1692.0,1722.0,Subject,"In between. In between. I try to keep people for a while if I [inaudible] around me, [inaudible]. Yeah. They're always there. Though I don't bother them, the older ones. It's like, okay, come over to more current people [laughter]. They're kind of more up-to-date with what's going on, what I'm going through. It depends."
1722.0,1724.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That makes sense.
1724.0,1731.0,Subject,Yeah. I try. I try [laughter] my best. Yeah.

Also I like real-life stories, people's stories. "
1804.0,1806.0,Interviewer,The stories about resilience too.
1806.0,1820.0,Subject,"Yeah, resilience. Although I like fantasy, on a total different world and different scenes and, oh wow, kind of escaping [inaudible] sad reality or [inaudible] reality."

I'm going to be better when I rise up. You're not going to kill me or make me feel bad or feel defeated."" Instead of arisen, feeling defeated by yourself for the right cause, not for the wrong cause."
