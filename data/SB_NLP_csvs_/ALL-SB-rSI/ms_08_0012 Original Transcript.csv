0.0,4.0,Interviewer,The first question that I will start with is how have things been going for you lately?
4.0,55.0,Subject,"Things have been going good. I got a job at PK Research. So it's taste testing, whether it be guacamole chips or gum, stuff like that. Instead of taking samples, I give out the samples, so I have to wear a lab coat and a hair net and everything. So that's been going good for a while. And took a break off college. I don't know if you heard what happened, but I had an episode at college where I smoked weed, and then I wasn't acting like myself. And I ended up in Westchester Medical Center for a week, which wasn't good. So that's the reason I'm not in college this semester, but I'm going back next semester and going to finish everything up. I'm very close to finishing my degree, bachelor's degree in music industry and technology. So it's going to go good."
55.0,65.0,Interviewer,"Oh, nice. So what do you think drew you to that degree?"
65.0,130.0,Subject,"Well, when I first graduated high school in 2013, I went straight into WCC, Westchester Community College, and I did computer science because I've always been interested in computers. That was a very math-heavy degree, and math was my worst subject, actually [laughter], so I couldn't see myself doing that. Then I wanted to go into business and do finance and learn Chinese and try to make the most money possible, but once again, I ran into accounting, and that sort of was my downfall. So I think I was around 20, I just decided to get my associate's degree and just finish WCC and just get my degree in music because music has always been a huge part of my life. I've been playing violin since I was age 9 and making music on my computer with the programs and stuff. So a couple of years from now, I see myself either making music for movies or being a mixing engineer, live sound engineer, anywhere I can find money because it's sort of a tough field."
130.0,139.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, definitely. But what do you think-- what is it like? So what do you do day-to-day?"
139.0,140.0,Subject,When I'm at college? 
140.0,141.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
141.0,196.0,Subject,"We have a lot of classes on advanced mixing, audio for video, electronic music. A lot of different classes, and I go to college in Dobb's Ferry at Mercy Campus, and it's a very nice campus. I have, usually, a three-hour class or two three-hour classes in one day. And we just go over synthesizers. Pro Tools is the main software that we use, and I have to know the software in and out, every little last detail of it. So a lot of keyword command remembering, a lot of shortcuts, stuff like that. And after that's all done, I usually try to either work on more music. My homework is to make music, so it's awesome. Either that or I try to go to the gym, hang out with friends. Yeah. "
196.0,207.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And so you said that you took a break from college because of this episode, you called it. What was that like?"
207.0,302.0,Subject,"I was doing really good this semester. Must have been only like two or three weeks into the semester, and I had a presentation for this class called Junior Seminar, which is basically you have to create your own business Shark Tank idea. And then, at the end of the class, they'll actually pitch it and see where it goes from there, which is a really cool opportunity. So I had this idea called Buyer Labs, and it's basically a science company that I want to start. So I wrote down the whole synopsis on a page. That's what you were supposed to do, basically. And I got dressed in a suit, briefcase. I was all very excited. And I was under a lot of stress, and I don't think my mental was okay around that time. I was acting strange. That was before the mood stabilizers sort of kicked in, whereas I'm more stable now. And I was so nervous before the presentation. This is the dumbest idea I had, but it was just part of me being stressed out. I was like, ""Oh, what if I just took a hit of weed before my presentation? It might calm me down a little bit,"" which has never happened before. It never makes me more calm, in situations like that at least. So I was asking all everybody around, random people, like, ""Oh, hey. Do you have a vape pen?"" That's not a good thing to do. And it was funny, when I was in Westchester Medical Center, the girl said to me, ""Oh, you did everything that the D.A.R.E Program didn't tell you to do [laughter]. So basically what--"
302.0,304.0,Interviewer,What does that mean?
304.0,307.0,Subject,You remember the D.A.R.E Program? Dare to Resist Drugs and Violence?
307.0,309.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. Yeah."
309.0,373.0,Subject,"You forgot about that? Okay [laughter]. Yeah. Basically, to make a long story short, I went out to smoke a cigarette from class, when the class began. And then I finally found somebody who had a vape pen. I ended up not going back to class, and I ended up going back to the gym during class, which is horrible. And then I went back to class, and I threw my phone at the wall. Remember we were talking about phones and stuff [laughter]. And there was a presentation on something. And I was just like-- I wasn't acting like myself. So after that, I was just talking to a lot of people who were trying to help me. And after then, it sort of clicked, like wait, that wasn't me. And the weird thing about it was is I was trying to-- it didn't feel weird to me. It was like I had no common sense, and it was really weird. So I'm better now, though. And cleared up the whole thing with Mercy College, and it's going fine."
373.0,386.0,Interviewer,Perfect. That sounds great. And do you remember what was going through your head when all that was happening?
386.0,414.0,Subject,"I was like, ""Oh, I should work out. Oh shit, I got to go back to class."" And I run back to class, and I was just-- and then when I was throwing the phone at the wall, I was like, ""Oh, should I do it? Will it be funny? Yeah, I think it's going to be funny. I'll do it."" And then just no common sense, really. Like illusions of grandeur and a lot of that. Just, I don't know, it was weird. I was bipolar a little bit, and it wasn't good."
414.0,415.0,Interviewer,But now how do you feel?
415.0,419.0,Subject,Yeah. I'm on Depakote. I feel fine now. It's fine. Yeah. 
419.0,423.0,Interviewer,Great. And are you excited to go back?
423.0,424.0,Subject,Yeah.
424.0,425.0,Interviewer,Very cool.
425.0,427.0,Subject,Yes. 
427.0,432.0,Interviewer,"So what have you been doing now, in your time?"
432.0,464.0,Subject,"Yeah. I have a lot of free time on my hands, so I've been trying to fill it with productive things at least, like reading my college textbook and practicing instruments. And we're learning music theory, which is really tough. I don't know if you know that. It's a really tough subject. But I've been sort of taking a break from that. I feel like there's only so much I can do until I go back to college, really, so it's been sort of tough to fill up my free time. "
464.0,470.0,Interviewer,Yeah. But are your parents supportive?
470.0,471.0,Subject,Yeah.
471.0,472.0,Interviewer,They seem pretty--
472.0,475.0,Subject,"Parents are awesome, so can't complain about that."
475.0,487.0,Interviewer,Perfect. What kinds of jobs do you see yourself doing after you finish your degree? What would be the ideal?
487.0,491.0,Subject,My dream job would probably be writing music for video games.
491.0,492.0,Interviewer,"Oh, cool."
492.0,548.0,Subject,"Or movies or something, anything where I can take visuals and sort of put an audio spin on that. And I find it fun because it's very creative oriented, which I think is my strong suit. Either that or mixing or mastering engineer where I say like, ""Oh, hey. We need you to-- this band just recorded all these tracks. Can you mix them for us?"" And be like, ""Yeah, sure."" And that's a pretty tough job, actually, because you might have four or five mixes to do in a week. And I'm still gaining the skills to make it sound like radio quality. And third, maybe live sound for a concert or something. That's more of a-- you get more of an hour-- work by the hour. Because all the work in my field is freelance, which is really hard. So it's tough finding an actual job-job. So that worries me sometimes, but--"
548.0,555.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what exactly is mixing? I hear that word all the time.
555.0,576.0,Subject,"Mixing is the process of taking each individual element in the song and either raising the volume, decreasing the volume, or making it on the left side or the right side. And basically, just using any methods to make the song sound good when you put on headphones or when you listen to it in the car. "
576.0,583.0,Interviewer,"How do you think-- so how does it work if you have one general speaker versus headphones? It surely is the same song every time, the same mix."
583.0,625.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's called stereo and mono. And say you're in a store or something and you hear it off the speaker, you actually have to check your mix is in mono. And at my school, there's a button on the speaker thing. You press it, and it does mono. And I'm actually learning about this now. If you pan something hard left or hard right, it won't pick up in mono at all, so you have to always check your mixes in mono. And mixing for that, I think you just put more stuff in the center, basically. And also, I heard, when you go to a concert or a rave or something, it's also in mono, so it's pretty interesting. "
625.0,629.0,Interviewer,Just like when you listen to the Beatles and you have vocals in one ear and--
629.0,630.0,Subject,That'd be stereo.
630.0,631.0,Interviewer,That's stereo?
631.0,633.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, the headphones is always stereo."
633.0,639.0,Interviewer,But then how does it end up sounding right on the speakers? It's-- 
639.0,644.0,Subject,It's a fine art [laughter]. It's funny you ask that because I'm reading about that in my textbook right now.
644.0,645.0,Interviewer,Oh. Oh.
645.0,646.0,Subject,So--
646.0,647.0,Interviewer,So maybe you can tell me after you finish the chapter.
647.0,649.0,Subject,Yes [laughter]. Yes. 
649.0,656.0,Interviewer,"Very cool. And your job now, that also sounds fun. How did you come to do that?"
656.0,708.0,Subject,"It's funny, I was doing these taste tests just to get a little cash on the side. So I was doing - what was it? - cough drops and potato chips or something, just random stuff. And my friend from high school worked at the front desk, and I was like, ""Yo, are you hiring here?"" And he was like, ""Yeah, man. Just ask the boss, Grace."" So at this time, I was applying for a lot of different jobs. I mostly applied for four or five. But I ended up getting the job, and right before I got the job, I had two different people asking for interviews. It was Sam Ash Music stores and the store in the mall that sold shirts. So I was thinking, ""Which one's going to be the best?"" And I chose the PK Research because it's not standing all the time, so it's a little bit easier. And it's more stuff to do, instead of standing behind a cash register and doing nothing, so. "
708.0,714.0,Interviewer,What do you do in the day-to-day there?
714.0,766.0,Subject,"Yeah. Basically, what I do day-to-day, say there'll be a study-- I can't give exact details, but say it's bubblegum, right? And we're going to say, ""Okay, Matt--"" They come in with receipt tickets, and that's the person's name and their address, and then I have to sign them in to the computer, basically, hand them samples, clean everything up, and then prepare for the next study. I'm usually working with another person who puts the samples on the plate with a corresponding number. And it's a system. It's not that hard. The hardest part of the job is definitely when my friend at the front desk overbooks everybody because of corporate, and then I have like 15 people coming in while the last 2 people are finishing. And that's really rough to get through. It's not the most high-paying job in the world, so I'm just going to stick with it. "
766.0,772.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So do they do it in groups, or is it individually?"
772.0,779.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's group studies, so up to maybe 20 people in the big room. "
779.0,783.0,Interviewer,And they each have a sample?
783.0,791.0,Subject,"Yeah. They each have a little laptop station, and they type in what they like. And it's like a multiple-choice quiz type thing."
791.0,795.0,Interviewer,That's so cool. I want to do that.
795.0,798.0,Subject,Yeah [laughter]. It feels like you're working at a lab or something.
798.0,809.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Well, I want to just taste everything [laughter]. How did you find that in the-- how did you find a gig to start trying things?"
809.0,842.0,Subject,"My friend told me about it. And I used to do it as a kid too, with yogurt tests and stuff. That was when I was really little. But yeah, my friend was like-- I just came over to his crib one day, and he was on the website. I was like, ""What is that?"" He was like, ""Oh, it's this pkresearch.com."" It's funny online, it's like a gimmick. You have PK Coins or whatever, and it's some system to rip you off. But I just work for the company now. It's funny, they still call me for the tests. And I'm like, ""No, I work here now [laughter]."" I really had to tell them that."
842.0,850.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that would not be good. But are you blinded? Do you know which sample is which?"
850.0,852.0,Subject,"No. A lot of times, I don't. "
852.0,860.0,Interviewer,"Okay, [inaudible] should be okay. And you said that you go to the gym a lot, it seems like."
860.0,874.0,Subject,"I've been trying to keep up with it. It's just hard because it's winter, and it's as if you're really lazy and like, ""Ugh."" But yeah, I've been working out since I was 14. It's a good thing to do. It keeps me healthy. It's fun with some music. "
874.0,878.0,Interviewer,So how did you start doing that? That's a lot of discipline. 
878.0,902.0,Subject,"I just had these two 12-and-a-half-pound weights in my room. And I was like 13-years-old, so all I would do is just biceps curls [laughter]. It was the only thing I would do. So then I went and started going to the gym more often, started doing more back and chest, legs, everything. I just like it because it's fun, I look good and you feel stronger. Yeah."
902.0,904.0,Interviewer,It's important to you to feel strong?
904.0,917.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't know if you ever played-- do you play video games or not really? No? Well, when you get really strong, it feels like your body's wearing armor, so it's pretty cool. Yeah. "
917.0,918.0,Interviewer,Interesting. 
918.0,925.0,Subject,"Yeah, that's how I feel. I don't know about now. I've been eating a lot of chocolate [laughter], but."
925.0,928.0,Interviewer,It is the holidays. Everyone's eating a lot of chocolate. 
928.0,933.0,Subject,Yeah. I think I might be part of the people going back in January to the gym because I'm just--
933.0,934.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Oh, for sure."
934.0,945.0,Subject,"--I've just been trying to run, but it's so cold to go to the gym. So I'm like, ""Eh."" But they're just excuses. Today's Monday. I told myself I was trying to go this week, so wish me luck. "
945.0,961.0,Interviewer,"Good luck. Okay, so you spend some time at the gym. What else do you think you would like to see yourself do when you go back--"
961.0,962.0,Subject,To college?
962.0,963.0,Interviewer,--to school. Yeah. 
963.0,1004.0,Subject,"Definitely be good with my money. Not try to save that-- not spend that much money because I really need a car really bad. Just have fun, learn the most I can, make the most industry connections I can. Gain a lot of skills, and also video editing. I want to go to the animation department at my college and ask them if they need any music for their movies, so that's a big idea I have. And, yeah, just try to-- I think my main goal is to be mentally stable and just even keeled and not make any mistakes again, so. "
1004.0,1008.0,Interviewer,It seems like you're well on your way.
1008.0,1009.0,Subject,Thanks.
1009.0,1015.0,Interviewer,"And what about before then? So when do you start, again?"
1015.0,1016.0,Subject,"Oh, January 22nd."
1016.0,1018.0,Interviewer,Okay. So you've got about a month.
1018.0,1019.0,Subject,"Yeah, basically. "
1019.0,1023.0,Interviewer,"Well, there's the holidays too. Have any plans for those?"
1023.0,1050.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm going to go-- it's up in the air right now with my family, so I'm pretty sure I'm going to have Christmas by myself with my family. And then, after, I'll go to my extended family in Scarsdale and have dessert over there, which is good. But no big party or anything where I'm jumping on the bed, ""It's Christmas [laughter]!"" I used to do that all the time. Too old for that now. "
1050.0,1051.0,Interviewer,
1051.0,1052.0,Subject,And then--
1052.0,1053.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, go ahead."
1053.0,1057.0,Subject,"--in January, I'm going to start working in like 20 days, so all of that, which is good."
1057.0,1058.0,Interviewer,Where at? [crosstalk]?
1058.0,1071.0,Subject,"At PK Research. I was a little bit disappointed to find out that my job was not working this week because of Christmas. They have to send out all the reports at the end of the year, so [inaudible] whatever."
1071.0,1077.0,Interviewer,"And what do you think, when you were a kid, made you jump up and down like that? What about Christmas?"
1077.0,1085.0,Subject,"I don't know. I'd see the kids doing it on TV, so I think that's really the reason why. Yeah. "
1085.0,1104.0,Interviewer,"Well, that sounds like a lot of fun. And so I'm getting a good sense of how things are going for you now. What about before? What was childhood like? What was--?"
1104.0,1106.0,Subject,Want me to start from the beginning [laughter]?
1106.0,1107.0,Interviewer,Whatever you think is important.
1107.0,1178.0,Subject,"Okay. I've had a pretty good life so far. Very lucky to have two supporting parents, have a roof over my head and food in the fridge and stuff like that. I know a lot of people don't have that. It's very sad. But I was born in '95. When I was little, my grandma watched over me a lot because I would go to-- my mom had her job. I was always into science and cars and technology and Yu-Gi-Oh! and all that stuff. Yeah, childhood was good, but I always wanted to grow up so fast and stuff like that, and be like a grownup and have my own house and car. And that's coming soon [laughter], but I feel like I had a good childhood. Just looking back, I don't know if I'd relive because it's just a long time. I feel pretty old. I'm 24 now, but I just feel like time is pretty long, so yeah."
1178.0,1190.0,Interviewer,Oh. Do you have any-- what do you think is your most-- what memory stands out the most for you from childhood?
1190.0,1228.0,Subject,"I think if I can remember my first birthday party-- think I have a really good memory of when I was a kid. Memories that stand out the most-- there's a lot of them, but probably when I went to Disneyland. And then I think when I was trying to find the toys on Christmas, and I saw that I had the Buzz Lightyear thing. And they're like, ""Oh, don't look at that [laughter]."" So there's that. And good memories. I wouldn't say bad memories, which is good. "
1228.0,1233.0,Interviewer,Very cool. And - excuse me - are you an only child?
1233.0,1234.0,Subject,Yeah.
1234.0,1236.0,Interviewer,And what was that like?
1236.0,1245.0,Subject,"Sort of lonely at times, but I don't know what it's like to have a brother or sister, so I don't know. What about you? Do you have any brothers or sisters? No, you're an only child too? Okay. "
1245.0,1253.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you think-- or do you ever wish you had siblings?
1253.0,1255.0,Subject,"For like five minutes, and then I'm like, ""Nah."""
1255.0,1264.0,Interviewer,Same. Interesting. So you said sometimes you were lonely. Do you have a memory of being lonely?
1264.0,1310.0,Subject,"Yeah, a lot during my youth just because-- I mean, I had a good amount of friends, but friends come and go, and they come back, and they come back, and then go. So sometimes, and say, maybe, early high school it was tough to find friends sometimes. And I found myself-- I was a very extroverted person, so I sort of got down when I didn't have any friends. But now I'm starting to realize - excuse me - in adult life, sometimes you're just going to be lonely for a long time and you just have to get over that. Now I'm fine with being alone, but I do still get bored. So it's balance. "
1310.0,1312.0,Interviewer,But you said you see friends sometimes now.
1312.0,1314.0,Subject,"Not anymore, really."
1314.0,1315.0,Interviewer,No?
1315.0,1317.0,Subject,No.
1317.0,1319.0,Interviewer,So what do you do to fill your boredom?
1319.0,1321.0,Subject,Lots of video games [laughter].
1321.0,1325.0,Interviewer,Right. So what are your favorite video games?
1325.0,1366.0,Subject,"Oh, I never thought you'd ask me that question [laughter]. Got to be Metroid Prime, Splinter Cell, Counter-Strike. Call of Duty 4 is the best one, in my opinion. I like Mario Kart. That one's good too. The list goes on, but I've been trying to get out and do more stuff instead of playing video games all the time. I've played video games a lot throughout my life, like a lot a lot. Maybe like 60% of my life is video games. But I just want to go out and do stuff. I don't want to be behind the mouse and keyboard all day. It's fun once in a while, but."
1366.0,1371.0,Interviewer,What kinds of things are you trying to switch to? 
1371.0,1374.0,Subject,"As far as not-- oh yeah, not being video games?"
1374.0,1376.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm. 
1376.0,1388.0,Subject,"Travelling, doing stuff with friends. Going on road trips. Just having fun. I don't know. "
1388.0,1390.0,Interviewer,Okay. Where do you like to go? It sounds like a lot of travelling.
1390.0,1407.0,Subject,"I like to go to [Dam Busters?] a lot. That's probably my favorite place to go. I like the Nintendo Store in New York City, which is sort of counterintuitive because I just said no video games, but [laughter]. I just like experiences with friends. People camping is fun."
1407.0,1408.0,Interviewer,Camping.
1408.0,1411.0,Subject,"Yeah. Except I don't like bears, so."
1411.0,1412.0,Interviewer,I don't think [crosstalk]. 
1412.0,1413.0,Subject,No?
1413.0,1416.0,Interviewer,My gosh. Have you ever encountered a bear camping?
1416.0,1417.0,Subject,Yeah.
1417.0,1418.0,Interviewer,What?
1418.0,1431.0,Subject,"Yeah [laughter]. My friends did because I told them not to go out at night. So then they went out at night, and nothing bad happened, but the bear was - I don't know - 50 feet away at nighttime. "
1431.0,1432.0,Interviewer,Gosh.
1432.0,1433.0,Subject,Yeah. I was pretty shook.
1433.0,1437.0,Interviewer,That's crazy. Wait. Where were you hiking or camping?
1437.0,1439.0,Subject,I guess I'll have to tell the whole story now.
1439.0,1440.0,Interviewer,Yeah [laughter]. 
1440.0,1459.0,Subject,"So I was with my friend, Tailor and Avery. And they're both guys. They have girls' names [laughter]. I don't really see them anymore. But long story short, we were all camped out. We had everything set up. I was in my tent sleeping, and I told them before, ""Don't go out at night."""
1459.0,1460.0,Interviewer,"Oh, gosh."
1460.0,1481.0,Subject,"And these kids are so stupid. They went to go wash the dishes at night, at - I don't know - like a 10, 15-minute hike down this path. And then they wake me up. It's freezing cold. It was like, ""Matt. Matt."" There's a bear. I'm like, ""What?"" And was like, ""I'm not getting out of my tent."" It was like, ""No. Point the light over there."" I'm like, ""Okay."" I'm just shaking, shaking, and like, ""Is it gone? Is it gone?"" I was like, ""Oh, shit. I don't want to die."" "
1481.0,1482.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh.
1482.0,1494.0,Subject,"So then, yeah, I just keep pointing the light at 40 feet down in the woods. And the bear wasn't coming. It's like, ""Oh, it's okay."" And the next thing, I'm like, ""Wow. You guys are so stupid."""
1494.0,1499.0,Interviewer,What do you think you would have done if it had started coming towards you?
1499.0,1513.0,Subject,"I don't know. You're supposed to go like this and scare it. I heard that's the technique. I don't know. I haven't probably thought about that. I'm more scared about these smell samples, to be honest [laughter]."
1513.0,1521.0,Interviewer,I really would be more scared of the bear. What do you think scares you about these?
1521.0,1530.0,Subject,"Because every time I think about that, I think about the Harry Potter jellybeans, which I've never had, but I've heard they're gross."
1530.0,1533.0,Interviewer,You mean like the ones they make in reality?
1533.0,1535.0,Subject,The disgusting ones.
1535.0,1539.0,Interviewer,The ones that are like vomit and stuff? Yeah [laughter]. 
1539.0,1541.0,Subject,"Why? Oh, boy."
1541.0,1542.0,Interviewer,"No, it's nothing like it. "
1542.0,1545.0,Subject,Okay. Good. Because that'd be a horrible prank. 
1545.0,1547.0,Interviewer,Yeah. No. No pranks here. 
1547.0,1550.0,Subject,"Okay, good. "
1550.0,1555.0,Interviewer,Okay. So camping. How long have you been camping?
1555.0,1564.0,Subject,"Camping for a while. I'm trying to think of the first time it was. Maybe when I was like 14 or something. Pound Ridge, Westchester. Have you ever been there?"
1564.0,1566.0,Interviewer,Mm-mm.
1566.0,1581.0,Subject,"Oh, it's nice, a nice reserve. Yeah, I love to camp. It's fun. Just like marshmallows is a plus, finding sticks and stuff. Just being out in nature when there's no bugs or mosquitoes because I hate mosquitoes."
1581.0,1583.0,Interviewer,I know. 
1583.0,1586.0,Subject,"Yeah, so."
1586.0,1592.0,Interviewer,Excuse me. Can you tell me the story of the first time you ever went camping? 
1592.0,1625.0,Subject,"Yeah. Me and my dad were out in Pound Ridge, and went in his Honda Accord. I remember it was a green Honda Accord. And we got a bunch of stuff from the store. Set up shop, and we set up the tent. It was just a fun camping trip. And we went on a lot of hiking. We must have hiked like three miles one day, which is crazy. And then we finally went to this overlook of the valley, which was on the trail map, and it was really cool. So it was a fun experience."
1625.0,1630.0,Interviewer,Very cool. So it's something that you started with your dad.
1630.0,1638.0,Subject,Yeah. It's like a tradition. But now I don't know if I want to back because of the bears [laughter]. 
1638.0,1639.0,Interviewer,So that was the last time you went?
1639.0,1651.0,Subject,"Yeah. Oh, no, it wasn't the last time I went. That was at [Farenstall?], which is near Pleasantville, I think, a bit north of there. Yeah. It's fun to do. "
1651.0,1654.0,Interviewer,And do you like hiking? 
1654.0,1655.0,Subject,"Yeah, I do."
1655.0,1657.0,Interviewer,What do you like about it?
1657.0,1666.0,Subject,"It's just a journey. It's like a quest on a video game sort of, I guess. Yeah. "
1666.0,1673.0,Interviewer,Cool. Yeah. So what do you think you like about video games?
1673.0,1699.0,Subject,"It's a challenge. It makes me think. My favorite game, [DayzX?], which came out in 2001, it was like five different ways to beat a mission. So you sort of like figure out what's the best way to do this. And the graphics are fun too, and I like playing with people and get pretty competitive sometimes. Yeah. It's a good experience. "
1699.0,1706.0,Interviewer,So how does it work? Do you play with people in real life? Or are they somewhere else?
1706.0,1750.0,Subject,"It depends on what game I'm playing. There's single player and there's multiplayer, and multiplayer usually means you're playing with somebody online. But there is local multiplayer, which means your friend's right next to you and it's a split screen. So there's that. Most of the time, I'm playing with random people online I don't know, and sometimes it's hard to get them to cooperate with teamwork, like the other day. I quit the match because, a long story short, they made the key to press forward shoot as well, so then they're all running around like idiots. And I'm like, ""Guys, aren't we going to try to win?"" Because really competitive match, and if you quit, you can't login for two hours, so."
1750.0,1751.0,Interviewer,What? That's so mean.
1751.0,1754.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah. I just had to quit. 
1754.0,1758.0,Interviewer,Wow. But why would they do that [crosstalk]?
1758.0,1780.0,Subject,"I don't know. Because the competitive matchmaking is not competitive anymore because people are just-- it's so easily accessible, I think. That's my theory. But yeah, and then people get angry and they start talking stuff about each other. And I'm like, ""What [laughter]?"" It's just hilarious. "
1780.0,1781.0,Interviewer,So you can hear--
1781.0,1782.0,Subject,Yeah.
1782.0,1783.0,Interviewer,--[crosstalk] talk [crosstalk]?
1783.0,1791.0,Subject,"I have a microphone on my desk instead of having a headset. So I wear headphones, and I get behind my desk, and it just works out."
1791.0,1793.0,Interviewer,Why do you like that better?
1793.0,1796.0,Subject,Than the headset?
1796.0,1797.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm.
1797.0,1801.0,Subject,Mainly because I already have really good headphones and I don't need the headset.
1801.0,1808.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I'm sure you must. Music. Your sound must be important. So what is good headphones to you?"
1808.0,1814.0,Subject,"Ooh, that's a good question. Anything but Beats by Dr. Dre. Those are the worst headphones."
1814.0,1815.0,Interviewer,Really?
1815.0,1823.0,Subject,"I mean, they're not bad. They have a lot of bass in them. So, I don't know, if you like bass-heavy stuff with no detail and sound, that's good. "
1823.0,1826.0,Interviewer,All right. Not Beats.
1826.0,1847.0,Subject,"My favorite company is beyerdynamic, and there's a really long name for the headphones but beyerdynamic DT 770 80 ohm headphones is what I have. And they're like 180 bucks, and they're really good. But they're pretty bulky, though. And then I like the Apple earbuds. "
1847.0,1848.0,Interviewer,You do?
1848.0,1849.0,Subject,But not the AirPods.
1849.0,1850.0,Interviewer,"No? Okay, yeah."
1850.0,1858.0,Subject,"Yeah, but the wired ones. Because those are the only ones that really fit in my ear good. And I need to get a pair of those because I lose them every day. "
1858.0,1863.0,Interviewer,"The pro ones now are supposed to be noise cancelling too, but those are the AirPods. "
1863.0,1881.0,Subject,"See, I think AirPods might be bad for your brain because having Bluetooth next to your head or having two Bluetooths in your head is not good for your brain. I don't think anybody really realizes that anymore."
1881.0,1882.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that is?
1882.0,1896.0,Subject,Just because your brain emits - what is it? - alpha and beta waves or something. It's almost like having your cell phone in your pocket the whole time. So I just am a little bit fearful about buying AirPods.
1896.0,1898.0,Interviewer,"Right, [inaudible]. "
