2.0,5.0,Interviewer,All right. So how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,9.0,Subject,"Rough. You can say that, rough."
9.0,11.0,Interviewer,So what's been rough?
11.0,32.0,Subject,So let me see. Where do I begin? So the area that I live in is becoming very hostile. There's people that want to attack my girlfriend and attack my daughter.
32.0,33.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my gosh."
33.0,85.0,Subject,"Yeah. So it's like that's another reason why I want to get the money together so I can move because we can avoid issues and getting locked up. We still have this case going on with my daughter. The case is almost beat, but they're trying to pull a rabbit out the hat, and they trying everything that they can to sabotage this operation, so. I don't know. I'm just trying the best that I can right now. It's rough in an Uber. It's not sending me any trips to basically make money. I'm not really from New York and Manhattan like that, so it's really rough right now."
85.0,93.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. That's so hard. What is the operation exactly that you're talking about with your daughter that people are sabotaging?"
93.0,134.0,Subject,"Oh, remember I told you that she's in ACS foster care? Yeah, so basically, we had court, and they making up a lot of lies saying that we're not stable enough to take care of her. The judge wasn't having it. She saw through all their lies and BS, so I'm not too worried about that, as long as we're doing what we have to do, we'll be good. But I'm just taking it one step at a time, one day at a time, and I'm hoping that something positive comes my way eventually."
134.0,146.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So how long have you and your girlfriend had your daughter for?
146.0,246.0,Subject,"I mean, she is four right now. Her birthday just passed, April 29th, yeah. They're questioning her. They trying to put lies in her head that she must-- she's already kind of manipulated in her head, but she's calling the foster mother Mommy, and they're basically questioning her, saying, ""Are they treating you right? Did they hit you?"" And stuff like that. And her mouth is crazy. She has a crazy mouth on her. She's like, ""Shut up before I hang up the phone on you. I don't want to talk to you. I want to go back to my mommy."" So they trying to put her in therapy like family therapy right now, so. It's a lot of craziness going on. My girlfriend, she spoils her, so it's like she got into the habit of kind of thinking that she can get her way whenever she wants to, like when she gets mad and she folds her arms. She rolls her eyes. And it's like as long as she's there with the foster mother, she's going to continue to put things in her head, and it's only get harder and harder and harder, so we're trying to get out of this situation as soon as possible."
246.0,252.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So is she not living with you guys right now? She's living somewhere else?
252.0,294.0,Subject,"So she's with us from Monday to Friday because she got school, and her school is literally right next to our building, but she goes back on Friday, Friday afternoon after school, so. We take turns on who takes her when and where and stuff like that. And the judge sees our effort. She sees that we're going above and beyond for her. And I feel like when we have a few more steps to go through before she's be like in our custody, so we're just keeping our heads up and trying the best that we can at this point."
294.0,311.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that sounds like it. It's so great that the judge is recognizing all your efforts and that she sees that. Could you tell me a little bit about what your daughter's like? You mentioned she has a mouth on her. What else? What about her?"
311.0,345.0,Subject,"She's sassy. She's really sassy. She's bougie. What I mean by that is, so I'd buy her french fries, right, from the supermarket. And it'd be the slim-cut french fries, the same style of french fries that you get from McDonald's. If she sees me making those french fries, ""I don't want those french fries. I want McDonald's."""
345.0,347.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's funny."
347.0,364.0,Subject,"So what I do now is, when I do buy her McDonald's, I save the container that the McDonald's come in, the french fries. I throw some salt on that. I give it to her. ""Olivia, your french fries is here. McDonald's is here."" And she'll--"
364.0,367.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's smart."
367.0,448.0,Subject,"She'll be tearing it up, so. Other than that, it's like she wants to get her way 24/7. She's kind of disrespectful with her mouth. She talks back to her mother. I put my foot down, she don't talk back to me, but. That's what they doing right now. They trying to seek, destroy, divide, and conquer. And I'm not allowing it to happen, so. School-wise, she's doing good. And I would call it a day care. One of the teachers there, she's very disrespectful. I believe that she's working with ACS. I brung in a change of clothes because sometimes, she'll pee on herself. And they keep telling us to bring in more and more and more clothes. And it's like, if we don't bring in the clothes, it looks bad on us. So I bring in some clothes. I took some pictures, and they still basically trying to set us up for failure because we're so close to that goal. I'm not allowing it to happen."
448.0,456.0,Interviewer,So what do you think is the reason why they want you to bring in more and more and more clothes if you already are bringing them in?
456.0,475.0,Subject,"It's just to show that we're not stable financially, I guess. This is another loophole to basically sabotage the operation. But I'm always thinking two steps ahead, so I'm not too worried about it."
475.0,484.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So can you tell me a little bit about how you're thinking two steps ahead and what you're planning and what you're up to?
484.0,496.0,Subject,"So basically, money-wise, I said that Uber wasn't it cutting it no more, Uber Eats, so I thought--"
496.0,498.0,Interviewer,"Okay, sorry about that."
498.0,585.0,Subject,"It's okay. But that Uber Eats wasn't cutting it, really, so I invested with this company, and I'm happy that I did. It was money that I really didn't have at the time, but I took a leap of faith and it paid off, so I'm just going to get the money out now. And because right now, we live in [inaudible] so I'm trying to relocate to a Manhattan apartment or-- I'd seen a couple of mansions in New Jersey. I've seen the mansion in Michigan, and I see that that goal is very realistic, it's very possible. Because Bitcoin is very lucrative. It's a very lucrative thing. I feel like right now, if you look into the value of the dollar, it's about to drop. And what's going to be the currency-- because think about it this way. You go into supermarkets and stuff like that, we're going through inflation right now, so it's like everything is going up. The prices is going up on everything. And all this ties to a bigger picture, but I want to be financially ready for when disaster strikes, and it's about to strike very, very soon, so."
585.0,592.0,Interviewer,And so what would it look like for you to be ready financially for that disaster?
592.0,680.0,Subject,"Basically, I would have freeze dry food. I would have a [aquaponic?] system set into places like when you have fish in the tank, and the fish kind of coincides with growing fruits and vegetables. I would have my own land, my own property. I would have a underground bunker. I would have car for transportation, all the necessary essential needs to survive, basically, because you never know when disaster is going to strike. It's unpredictable. You just got to pay attention to the signs. And I would say it, but it's contradictory, so I'm not going to really get into that right now. But I think we had this conversation last time, so if you're interested, I can give you that information. You can look into it again, but it's a lot that's going on right now, and it's a lot that's about to happen, so [inaudible] be ready for it."
680.0,694.0,Interviewer,So how long do you feel like you want to be ready for-- how long of a period are you prepared to have all these measures in place for?
694.0,777.0,Subject,"To be honest with you, you should look at the-- well, it's a channel called Hassan Campbell that I watch. He says you had to live dangerously but move like you're on the run, so. Basically, once I get my own land and once I get my own property, what I would do is I would just continue to stock up on the essentials and stuff like that. I would get freeze dry foods to survive for at least 100 years because you want to over prepare yourself. I would have measures set into place where I'm comfortable, at the same time, I'm comfortable in my living situation and I'm comfortable when disaster strikes. But yeah. The first step is getting this money out so I can reinvest. And then once I reinvest, I could start building up my [inaudible] because the more money that you invest, the more money that you can get out in the future, short term and long term."
777.0,784.0,Interviewer,Are you ever concerned when you're doing the investing that you may lose the money?
784.0,785.0,Subject,No.
785.0,787.0,Interviewer,No?
787.0,850.0,Subject,"If you have a loser's mindset, you're never going to get ahead in life. When you're a entrepreneur, you're going to win some, you're going to lose some. That's just part of the game. You can't have the type of mindset because then you're going to be stuck working a 9:00 to 5:00 job. I know some people that graduated college with a master's degree or bachelor's degree, and they're working at McDonald's. So it's all about mindset. It's all up here. You got to change your mindset and adapt to this currency that's going on right now. NFT is a new wave right now, and Bitcoin is a new wave. Ethereum is a new wave. All these foreign currencies is a new wave. And if you don't hop on it, you're going to get left behind. Do you know what the metaverse is?"
850.0,855.0,Interviewer,"No, why don't you tell me?"
855.0,900.0,Subject,"So I'm not too familiar with the metaverse, but what I do know is, think of it like a virtual world, right? It's like a virtual world, but you can build your own land and property in this metaverse, so. What is this guy's name? Elon Musk, Elon Musk. He's built technology where when you die in real life, he can remove your brain from your head, put a chip in your brain, and put you in the metaverse. Yeah."
900.0,906.0,Interviewer,"Whoa. I've heard of him, but I didn't realize he could do that."
906.0,991.0,Subject,"There's technology going on right now where they're creating robots. Have you ever seen the movie, I, Robot or I can't remember that many movies or robots. But basically, they're creating artificial intelligence to replace humans, and like I said, all these stuff ties into a deeper picture and may sound unbelievable, but you're not going to know until you do research of your own. I didn't believe in all this stuff either, but once I start connecting the pieces together, I realized that all this stuff was factual, so. Have you ever seen the movie, The Terminator? They building technology to replace humans and also to-- if you don't take that mark like we talked about-- you know what I'm talking about. You're going to be extinguished, so to say. You can look up FEMA death camps. They have coffins the size of six feet deep where they can-- yeah. They're going to drag you all to a-- first, there's going to be martial law. There's going to be martial law."
991.0,992.0,Interviewer,What's that?
992.0,1021.0,Subject,"So martial law is when the military gets involved when the people is not cooperating, the military gets involved. And you need to watch a show called Fear Of The Walking Dead or The Walking Dead. But Fear Of The Walking Dead, you'll get a better understanding of what I'm talking about. But basically, the military gets involved. They take you to a concentration camp."
1021.0,1022.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my God."
1022.0,1036.0,Subject,"Right now, what's going on is, the coronavirus. People was getting sick. I've seen the documentary-- wait. Before I continue, this video, is it being sent off to somebody?"
1036.0,1060.0,Interviewer,"No, so this video is basically we just use it to look at face expression and voice, so it's not about identifying you in any way. In fact, if we ever show it to other researchers outside of our institution, we always deidentify it. So that means we remove anything that has to do with you or connects to you in any way."
1060.0,1135.0,Subject,"Okay. So all right. So where do I begin? I feel a little bit more comfortable now. I mean, I'm not a threat. It's this guy on YouTube, like I say, his name is called Hassan Campbell. He interviews a lot of different celebrities and stuff like that. If you know who 6in9ine is, he is known for being a snitch, a snitch on this gang. He interviewed him. And he said, ""If I pulled out my guns right now and your team pulled out they guns, and we start shooting up the place, would you snitch?"" He couldn't give him a answer. But basically, these celebrities, they go through gay rituals. They go through all the different types of rituals and stuff where they dress them like dresses, they dress like females. You have to do bestiality. You had to go through having sex with animals and stuff like that. And this all ties back to the devil. Even the Pope has a secret army. It's called the Jesuits. All this stuff can be found on that book that I told you about, but."
1135.0,1137.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my God."
1137.0,1401.0,Subject,"All this ties back to basically the New World. Well, if you look up on Google, you can see a bunch of celebrities either doing this, which is 666. You going to see Jay-Z going like this, which is a pyramid, the All-Seeing Eye. Now, I talked to my business partner because he knows about this stuff too. He just point me on to something. He said that God is basically the All-Seeing Eye, but they trying to mind fuck you into believing that it's the devil that has the All-Seeing Eye. But there's a lot of symbolism that's using this and it's a lot that goes into this. But the main point that I'm trying to say is, pretty soon what's going to happen-- and this is going to be global. They've already signed paperwork. While Will Smith was on stage smacking Chris Rock, they signed the paper to enforce a new world order. That's what it's called, a new world order. They signed paperwork. And what this new world order entitles is a one-world government system where there's going to be one leader in charge of the world, and that leader, he's going to be working miracles on earth as if he's Jesus Christ. That's going to be the Antichrist. That's the Antichrist, basically. But like I said, all this stuff, it sounds contradictory. I'm only bringing this up, not to sound crazy or not to sound obsessed, like I'm obsessing over this because I'm not. It's to warn other people and to get them prepared because me telling you this and the situation I'm in right now, I look like I'm-- I sound loosing or I sound crazy, but like I said, you never know until you look into it. You'll be amazed at what's going on, what our government is doing behind our backs. The news and stuff, that's why I don't really watch the news like that anymore. I only trust the news. You can look at that book. It's called The Secret Service by Bill Hue. He's like go into the real reason why the Titanic sunk, the real reason behind 9/11, the Waco Texas massacre, and all different types of stuff tied to catastrophes and global disasters in the US, period. But we as a people, we had to understand where we came from and where we're going. When we die, we have a soul in our body, and it's up to you where your soul goes once you die. It's what you do in this earth right here right now. A lot of people who's atheist and they don't believe in God, I try to ask, ""What is your purpose here? How were you put here in this Earth?"" I don't believe in the Big Bang Theory. I don't believe in none of that stuff. I believe that there is a God. We do have a purpose because we can't just magically appear out of thin air. There has to be a source of where we came from. And me as Christian, I'm seeing all the pieces starting to come together with global catastrophes, people turned against their own mother and father, brother fighting against brother, family separation, confusion in the home. Turn on people for simple things like money, wars. It's going to be-- it's going to be war, famine. I can't remember the other two, but it's the four horsemen. There's going to be a lot of disasters that's going to come onto the Earth once the rapture happens. The rapture's basically people that believe in God, they've been baptized. There's actually a movie on that too, it's called The Rapture. You should watch it, but."
1401.0,1402.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I haven't seen it."
1402.0,1723.0,Subject,"These movies, they have a lot of subliminal messages in them like they're finding-- there's another channel that I watch. He goes by the name of MrBallen. It's M-R-B-A-L-L-E-N. But basically, he was in Afghanistan, and he was deployed in a mission. He was in this cave system. It was either him or one of his team members. They was looking for the enemy. They get to this hilltop, and they see this giant like about 15, 20 feet tall with six toes and six fingers, dressed in caveman clothes. Basically what happened next is he came out the cave with a spear like about 15 or 20 feet long. Threw the spear. It killed one of the Army-- I forgot what they call, but they killed one of the military, and they shot it dead. It was supposed to be confidential, but somebody came out about it, talking about it. And they covered their face because when stuff like that happens and everything is supposed to be confidential, if you speak out about it, they're going to kill you. Because what happens is, it creates panic in the people in the community. And they're like, their mindset is, this stuff is supposed to be confidential. What's going to happen if people starts knowing that all the stuff is true? That's why when you see stuff like aliens and stuff like that, Area 51, which is real, they try to cover it up because they know what's going on. There's worlds beyond this world that we don't even know about. And they don't want us to know about that because it's going to create mass confusion. And people's going to start putting two and two together, and people's going to start getting themselves ready for the new world order, but the devil's mission is to seek, destroy, and conquer and separate. So he's going to try to drag as much people to hell with him as possible. And in the Bible, it says a woman with child would not survive. And what that means is, you won't be able to buy or sell without taking the mark of the beast. However, if we do take a mark of the beast, which is 666 on our forehand or forehead, you will be banned. You won't be able to enter the gates of heaven, that's why it's called the time of trouble. It's a lot of people that's going to be confused and not know what's going on. That's why I say you should watch the movie The Rapture because you're going to see what I'm talking about. They're going to drag you to a concentration camp. They already have guillotines in place. They have these big, black coffins. You can look it up. It's on Google. They have these big, black coffins the size of 6 feet, and it's about 12 feet deep to out three bodies at a time inside of it. And like I said, if you take that mark, you won't be able to enter the gates of heaven. But if you do take the mark, you'd be able to buy and sell. They have this new technology where they going to inject a RFID chip inside of your hand or arm. And if you don't take that chip, you won't be able to buy or sell either. And in my belief, I believe that chip is basically a kill-chip. If you don't cooperate, basically, they basically can, at a push of a button, you can die from that chip being implanted in you. And it's meant to track you to find out where you're going and to keep tabs on you at all times. All this stuff that I'm saying right now, it sounds crazy, but watch in the next couple of months to the next couple of years because I don't know exactly when it's going to happen. Going to see everything's starting to come to light. But all this stuff can be found on YouTube. It can be found in the news. They talking about this stuff, but they talk about it quickly so it can be confusing to you. And so you all know what's going on, but a lot of people are starting to wake up. They're starting to be woke. And they starting to become aware of what's actually going on and how corrupt our society is. And like I said, this all ties back to the devil in the world. And we're in spiritual warfare right now, so."
1723.0,1739.0,Interviewer,"So how do you decide what you're going to trust in terms of-- you mentioned that you don't like the news because you don't know if it's reliable, but you definitely have some other sources that are really reliable. So how can you decide what to trust and what not to trust?"
1739.0,1882.0,Subject,"So basically, you never know what to trust and what not to trust. You just have to follow the signs. Pay attention to what's going on, and then validate that information yourself, confirm that information yourself. Do research on top of research. I found out that Hassan Campbell, he's a spokesman. He's a messenger. And when you're a messenger, you're also a target. Look up the person. I forget his name. But he basically created a car, right, that can basically run on water in the '80s. And the FBI had a meeting with him, and supposedly, they want this invention to come to light. He was inside this restaurant, and his brother came back and saw it and was like, ""What's going on?"" They was like, ""They poisoned me."" He was coughing up black stuff, yeah. They poisoned him because they want to keep you controlled, gas and everything. It's part of the economy. They don't want you-- because water is easy access. It's going to destroy the economy. It's going to destroy the ability to fund these wars and stuff like that, so they want to keep the taxes flowing. They want to keep light, heat, and gas flowing. They want to keep you struggling. Even if you're rich. Even if you're rich. That's why I said, it's important to buy your own land. It's important to buy your own property. It's important to isolate yourself somewhere where you're not a target because everybody's going to start turning on one another and robbing people for their food, shooting people because it's going to be some people that's not going to take that chip. There's going to be some people that don't want to take the mark of the beast. And how else would you survive? The supermarkets is going to be swarmed with military and cops, so you have no choice but to avoid it. This is why you plan ahead."
1882.0,1885.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that makes sense."
1885.0,1886.0,Subject,What you going to have.
