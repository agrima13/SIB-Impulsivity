1.0,8.0,Interviewer,And the first question that I will ask you is how have things been going for you lately?
8.0,41.0,Subject,"I think I've been all right. I'm just focusing on eating every day regular meals and looking for a job, things for my wellbeing, creative expression, so-- I think that sometimes I feel scared inside or nervous, frightened, anxious. But I don't feel depressed lately."
41.0,47.0,Interviewer,Is depression something that you had been feeling before?
47.0,66.0,Subject,I think I have felt depression in the past when I feel like I can't do things that well or when I feel bogged down. But I would say that for the most part I struggle more with anxiety.
66.0,72.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what is that like to struggle with anxiety?
72.0,158.0,Subject,"Well, lately it feels different than the past. Lately it feels like I have some kind of misplaced feelings like I'm letting someone down or I'm letting myself down and I don't even know how or why. It feels like I don't have a place of safety inside myself or a place of acceptance and stability and praise or something. I guess, what I'm saying is that it can also just be diet related, I think. If I don't eat well, then I don't feel good. When I eat a good meal, then I feel less anxious. So when I feel anxious, though, then my mind races a lot. I was put on medication for that actually, so I had a lot of thoughts and sometimes it's hard for me to feel really present with all parts of myself, especially when I'm talking to someone. I kind of come off like I'm not fully listening. I don't know if that's related to anxiety, but I definitely would say that anxiety feels more familiar to me than what I know about depression."
158.0,169.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So I'm curious what it feels like when you have these racing thoughts.
169.0,258.0,Subject,"That's a term from when I was hospitalized, put on the medication I was put on. I don't think I've had that lately, but at the time it felt like my thoughts were really fast and I couldn't keep up with them, kind of like if there is a car and another car ahead and it's speeding, and they're both on the highway. It's almost like a CD that's skipping. These are thoughts that are your thoughts but you can't even keep up with them. That's what it felt like. I actually don't experience that level on a regular basis. That was when I had a psychotic episode or whatever you want to call it. But it does feel like that's a part of my mental life, because it's hard for me to talk to someone when they're talking too fast. It's challenging for me because my mind is already sometimes moving fast, doing its own thing. So I think it's hard for me to be in a conversation sometimes if I'm not vibing really well with the person, because then I just check out. My mind just checks out when I talk to anyone and it's already noticed that I'm drifting, and it can be really irritating or even worse, when I'm talking to them."
258.0,272.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. So when you kind of check out like that, what's going on in your head? "
272.0,360.0,Subject,"When I check out, usually I'm having other thoughts about things that have to do with me or other people than what's going on in front of me. But often I don't even know what they are until I actually check out. Or I do know what they are and then I can't hear what the person's saying to me, so-- I don't know what it is about talking to a person that triggers thoughts that don't have anything to do with them. But it almost feels like being around a person really does stimulate me to have other thoughts that aren’t about them. I don't understand that. But I guess an example would be I was thinking about-- was talking to my sister and then while I was talking to her--because I shared an intimate dream with her, a dream with someone who I know talked to me something personal and we were going to start a relationship. And it was a big deal that I had that dream, and then talking to her I got totally just-- I had this other content in my head come up about a totally different set of people that she doesn't even know. So it just feels like a lot to keep up with, because I'd rather just have those thoughts when I'm alone, not when I'm talking to a person. It's more triggered sometimes when I'm talking to a person, than when I'm just necessarily by myself. It's weird."
360.0,381.0,Interviewer,That's really interesting. And so you mentioned your sister. Do you think that that happens more with some people and less with others? Or is it kind of just generally when you're with people?
381.0,482.0,Subject,"It happens with other people too. I had a friend who was just so irritated at me. She was just annoyed seeing that I don't really listen when she talks. Can you imagine if you're talking to someone and you're like, ""What did you say? What did you say?"" It would just make you feel really frustrated because you need someone to have a reaction when you open up about something personal. You want to know what the reaction is. If someone's drifting off it's really annoying. And I had at least one friend open up to me about it a while ago. I think, overall, it makes me feel insecure because I don't feel like I can necessarily handle conversations that well, especially with new people. I guess I would love to move to a place where I could be around more neurally typical people, that kind of understanding. So yeah, it's definitely a sign for me now that I need to be alone or writing or something when I'm talking to someone and I have interruptive thoughts. Because I don't really know how to handle it when I'm talking to that person. I don't know how to be responsible and still be with them when I'm having them. I had to be [aside?], saying, ""Hey, I'm having a really hard time,"" which is also really annoying to them because they kind of relate to me, and then I'm making it about myself all over again. So it's hostile. It's a hostile behavior at that point."
482.0,490.0,Interviewer,Wow. So do you think that-- you mentioned writing. Is that something that helps you when you're talking to people?
490.0,528.0,Subject,"Writing really helps me just process my experiences better. Because my thoughts are so strong that when I start having them, I really can't hear what a person is saying to me. I actually can't when they're really strong. And sometimes they're just really strong. I don't know where-- and I think it's partly what has to do with being a writer is that you have access to your inner thoughts maybe more than another person is. You just [inaudible]. It's just part of your mental constitution. So I think it's all related, for sure."
528.0,551.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I'm sure. That's very cool. And you said you have these creative endeavors. You mentioned that in the beginning, and now you're talking about your writing. Do you mind telling me a little bit about those things and how they make you feel but also what you're doing with them?"
551.0,659.0,Subject,"Yes, so I'm working on a book of poems, I mean a collection of poems. So I'm just working on one of them today, actually. I'm on my computer and basically have pieces of things that I write, and then I try to combine them. So sometimes I write in a notebook, other times on a computer. Yeah. I'm really not sure what to say about it. It feels kind of like I'm wasting my time in some ways, but I also feel like it's what I do. It's how I express myself. I guess I have my own values that I strive for in my writing, things that I value about writing that I strive for and then it helps to show it to someone else and see if they respond to it the same way. And overall, it's a way to also kind of clean my system better of things that I need to process. So I'm really behind in a lot of ways on things that I need to process because just being isolated and having a lot of intense things happen during the COVID era makes me really feel like I need to write more. It also just gets me to be more in touch with myself, because I think I have a hard time being fully integrated, especially in a social situation around a person, like what I was saying to you. So writing helps me feel more integrated or at least know what my issues are if I want to know more about myself. Because sometimes I connect more with myself through writing than I do with another person because I'm an introvert."
659.0,678.0,Interviewer,"Interesting. That's cool that you kind of know that about yourself. And that word integrated, or it helps you integrate, is so interesting. How do you feel more integrated when you're writing?"
678.0,792.0,Subject,"I think I feel more integrated when I'm writing when I actually can tell that I'm writing something that's good, like well written because then I feel like I'm expressing myself in an effective way. So that helps me feel more integrated. And sometimes I think the levels of what I can express in writing is I can actually tell what I'm saying, in a way. Whereas if I talk to a person, I don't know how-- I can't always imagine how it makes someone feel when I talk to them. But with writing I kind of can tell if I'm succeeding at what I really want to say. So it's an expression valve and I have my own standards and it's a form of relating, I guess. And I look at things I wrote in the past, and it's just a way of expressing and-- I guess, it sounds like I'm overstating it, over-evaluating, but it's just that I'm good at it. I'm talented at it. So it's why it's a big deal for me, because it's something that I'm actually good at. And a lot of things I'm not good at. I struggle in relationships, so it's kind of a place where I can feel a sense of success. So it helps me feel more integrated. And actually, I need to exercise more and take more risks in my inner personal life. So there are plenty of other things I need to do to actually be more integrated, but in term of writing it's just a way for me to express how I feel and what words are saying and stuff like that."
792.0,807.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, for sure. And so you mentioned taking risks interpersonally. Do you feel like-- in what ways do you think that you maybe don't do that now?"
807.0,882.0,Subject,"Well, it doesn't really apply because during COVID I haven't [seen?] it. But it's okay. Actually, I think sometimes I hold certain concepts that are pretty rigid or not really useful when it comes to myself or other people, and I think discarding this association and those concepts are helpful to having an actual connection to a person, so kind of shedding or being less obvious about what can be really happening because it's probably not what's happening. I think it's encouraging to have a sense of freshness in a relationship or in an action, even someone that you really know well that you already know why you like each other; I think it's important to have surprises and new, fresh interactions with anyone."
882.0,887.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, absolutely. It keeps the magic alive. Right? "
887.0,999.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think being able to feel really intact and not disheveled inside or not weak or scared inside on a regular basis and not like I'm disassociating  when someone had-- what's it called? Acupuncture or something, then I felt like really integrated right afterwards. Yeah. I have some bodily behaviors that make me disassociate. I tell my therapist that I have body repetitive disorders, like skin picking and hair pulling. So I've [circled?] it a little bit last-- I have in the past, but those are all behavioral aspects of disassociating or not being able to be present in uncomfortable feelings. I think that when I am present if I have uncomfortable feelings it feels healthier. But it's just really hard for me sometimes. So being integrated would be able to be actually feeling my feelings more instead of disassociating from those feelings and being able to show up and yeah."
999.0,1017.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And okay, so what does it feel like when you disassociate from those feelings? How does that manifest itself in your experience?"
1017.0,1101.0,Subject," I'm not really sure how it manifests because I think it makes me just kind of not trust my feelings or feel disconnected from my feelings or have shallower feelings. In general, I would like to be feeling more. So I think that it makes me less kind when I'm not having feelings or when I'm not feeling them. So it makes me less open. But I feel like it’s possible to be open when I'm not-- I think being aware of how I want to be more integrated is a form of openness. And yeah, it's about being rooted in my body and feeling more embodied. And when I'm not feeling-- when I'm disassociating from my feelings, then I'm also not really in touch with my body either, I think. Or if I am, it's in a maladaptive way, like I already told you about the pulling and the picking habits."
1101.0,1127.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. That sounds difficult. And you mentioned that you thought that your diet and in some ways the isolation that's happening right now was related to some these things that you're feeling. I'm curious how you came to know that.
1127.0,1159.0,Subject,I actually worked with a psychiatrist a few years ago who also was a nutritionist. And she walked me through a lot of the steps in having a nicer diet for my body. So she believes that some of my symptoms were actually caused by inflammation and that it was diet related. So she taught me to not have as much gluten and dairy foods and have better diet. So that's really where that came from. And what's the other question about the disassociated or isolated--?
1159.0,1172.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I mean I think a lot of people right now are feeling that they're isolated. But maybe that's not your experience?
1172.0,1258.0,Subject,"I feel isolated because I don't have new people that I'm meeting or seeing because I don't have my vaccine yet. But that's not the only reason I feel isolated. So I feel isolated because I have experiences that I can't share in a complete way with anyone I know in my life right now. And some of them are disturbing to me and challenge my sense of reality or mental health. So that's pretty new for me and it makes me kind of have humility of spirit or something. But it also makes me scared because sometimes I feel scared like I don't know who I'm stepping on. Because I actually feel like I'm going through more than one thing that I can't handle. But I can handle it, it's just that-- I can handle it more than whoever I open up to, so that's isolating. It's an isolating thing to know you're having trouble with something, but that if you open up about it, the other person would maybe hurt more than you or just make it all go away. So it's like if you saw a ghost and you explained it to someone, and they explained it away with the first explanation you have, then it's kind of like, ""Well, what's the point of your ensuring it if they just agree with your first explanation?"" It's like they don't want to be troubled to the extent that you're troubled. But you're still troubled by it. So in a way, it's better to not open up at all, something like that. "
1258.0,1283.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So that must be really difficult to not really have anybody in your personal life to open up to about some of the things that are going on. And they sound like they are really disturbing you. What do you think you find the most upsetting that's happening to you?
1283.0,1353.0,Subject,"On two occasions I heard voices at night yelling things, and I still can't tell if it's just my mind. That's just really new for me. Because in the past, when I'd hear voices, whatever they call it in medicine, it was just input in my head that wasn’t a thought. But I could still tell that it wasn’t-- at the time, I thought it was a psychic experience or maybe just a split-off experience. But this is new because I really can't tell if it was my own mind or a recording of something that's playing in a nearby room or something. I really can't explain it. And I just haven't really moved on from that. But I also haven't gone through it. I'm okay. I look okay. I'm functioning, but, yeah, it’s disturbing. I can't explain it. So it's like I'm letting go. The process I'm using is to let go, is what I'm doing."
1353.0,1359.0,Interviewer,"It's a lot to let go of though, something that scares you so much. "
1359.0,1360.0,Subject,Yeah.
1360.0,1366.0,Interviewer,I'm sorry. It would be really difficult. You mentioned that you were in the hospital?
1366.0,1377.0,Subject,"I was in the hospital all the way back in, I don't remember, 2014, I think. Yeah. 2015."
1377.0,1380.0,Interviewer,Was that related to this or something else?
1380.0,1387.0,Subject,"Yeah, that was my first time being in the hospital for mental health issues. So that's when I was put on medicine."
1387.0,1392.0,Interviewer,And what was the experience of the medicine?
1392.0,1441.0,Subject,"They actually help me a lot because it totally took away my racing thoughts and I could write better. I actually was writing better, cover letters and stuff, and I wasn’t over thinking stuff. Really effective medicine, the olanzapine. It also made me gain a lot of weight which was bad. It had some negative effects. Made me extremely drowsy. Not drowsy, but made me really calm and it made me want to sleep a lot, not during the day, but at night. I gained a lot of weight and yeah. I definitely have tried to reduce my dose of that medicine in the last few years."
1441.0,1446.0,Interviewer,Interesting. Have you been able to do that?
1446.0,1460.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm down to 2.5. so-- I wanted it to be lower, but I think at this point I accept that I need it to be at this dose, rather than half of this dose. So at the time being, that's what I'm doing."
1460.0,1467.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And how do you think you were able to manage to bring it down?
1467.0,1506.0,Subject,"Well, actually, I worked with the healthcare providers through that. So it's really gradual over a long period of time because there are a lot of side effects to doing that, to tapering it. It helps also this last time I did that, my psychiatrist used a mood stabilizer at the same time, called lamotrigine. So I was able to offset some of the destabilizing effects of reducing the medicine that I experienced in the past. So it actually helped this time kind of ground me more, because the withdrawal symptoms actually look really hard to deal with."
1506.0,1520.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I can imagine. And so the reason you wanted to come down in dose was because of the side effects or--?"
1520.0,1641.0,Subject,"Yeah. I didn't want to be-- I didn't want to be on the medication and really overly reliant on it and I also just gained so much weight. It's one of the worst drugs for weight gain. So I didn't recognize myself anymore. And also, it just made me hungrier. It also makes you just crave food even more. So the food actually tastes better on that drug. It's funny. So I just really didn't want to have it anymore because I was trying to lose weight, and it's so hard with that drug. I gained 15 or 20 pounds on it in a really short period of time. But my mental health was pretty-- I'm pretty happy that I'm able to work on [inaudible] and I was taking my symptoms lately, the ones that are disturbing me. Like I was telling you that I'm hearing voices, that almost feels like it's-- I almost feel like it's not even related to my mental health because it really felt real to me. You know what I mean? I can tell when it's not my own mind. That's crazy. I even heard sounds that were also disturbing, that I even recorded on my phone. So at least I was able to record one of the things on my phone. Hold on a sec. Okay, sorry. I just did not take a call. So I guess what I'm trying to say is my mental health is always a struggle, but sometimes I use the word mental health as an umbrella term for other things that are just disturbing to me that I don't want to get into with the person I'm talking to, which feels kind of manipulative or, I don't even know how to say, annoying to everyone. But it's disturbing to me, and the person I'm talking to is too fragile to hear it. So it's almost like it's a mental-health dilemma for the other person or for me. It's just a disturbing thing to have to even talk about what was going through."
1641.0,1648.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah, you're so kind to others."
1648.0,1693.0,Subject,"No, I'm actually not. It's more my sister that I just have to be kind to because she's really fragile mentally. And she gets annoyed at me all the time. So when I say, I'm considerate to her, that's really the only person that I would even talk to one-on-one on this level. And I don't really know. I wouldn't say that I'm really kind to everyone. I think I'm more of an avoidant personality. I'm kind, but I don't really know how nice I am considering all that's actually going on during coronavirus. Yeah. It could be a lot better."
1693.0,1701.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. What do you mean, ""everything else going in coronavirus""?"
1701.0,1760.0,Subject,"I don't know. I think I've been more on the side of self-absorbed. So I don't feel like I have the emotional warmth to reach out to a friend of mine whose dad died, for example. I feel scared of having conversations with friends who are going through things that are things I can't imagine going through, especially because I never had a dad. I don't know what to say to-- anyway. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't feel like I have the ability to help someone emotionally right now. But I try to stay out of harm's-- I try to not step on other people. Or with my sister, I try not to open up things that I really need to talk about."
1760.0,1769.0,Interviewer,"What do you think, if anything, does that kind of do to you, keeping it inside like that?"
1769.0,1855.0,Subject,"I think it's not-- I think it's a lot to handle, which is why I'm glad I have access to therapy again. Because if I didn't have access to therapy, I wouldn't feel that sense of trust, that I would have an outlet every single week. But yeah, it's just my luck at the moment that I have a better person to talk to. It's just my fortune right now. So I think I have to just accept it and definitely try to write more. It's scary to write more. But the reality is that someday I might feel to open up. Maybe it doesn't matter. It's weird to just have to let go as though it doesn't matter. But it matters to me because it has an impact on what my mental health is according myself. Right? So yeah, it's definitely a little bit discouraging that I can't even know for sure if the voices I was hearing are really from me or not, because I actually know they aren’t from me. But then I don't have a rational explanation for where they could be coming from. So yeah, that's what I hold in. And yeah, I'm nervous and I'm scared."
1855.0,1871.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So I know writing is kind of this outlet and you kind of confront things through your writing, but you said it was scary. Then I'm curious where do you think that fear comes from?"
1871.0,1981.0,Subject,"Well, actually I'm scared for not just one reason. When I was hearing the voices, I was more irritated. I was like, ""Can that person just stop? It's so rude to be yelling in the middle of the night."" Also, I was just kind of trying to listen to them, trying to see if I could hear better. But my actual feelings of fear on a daily basis come from kind of more complicated ambient feelings, where I feel like I created problems for other people without really knowing it and where I have to take one more responsibility, and it's all up to me. It's all on me to step up and to grow up or to be more helpful and aware and just more remorseful of things I may have done to challenge someone unnecessarily or not protect someone or put someone in-- I don't know. It's up to me, and that's what's scary. Because I feel like I need help knowing what I did wrong. But if I didn't do anything wrong, but was still hurtful, that's also a grey area. So yeah, I feel almost like I need to have a perspective or a toolkit or role view faster than I actually have it. It's kind of scary to not have what you need when you need it."
