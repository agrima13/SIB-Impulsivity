2.0,5.0,Interviewer,So how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,32.0,Subject,"Good. Yeah. They're okay. I just moved again with my parents to Alabama, so it's fun. I'm trying to get back into school after taking a medical leave, going into the hospital. Yeah. Because I was going out a lot in the city, and I just didn't go to class, and then I got drugged, and then all sorts of different crazy things happened to me."
32.0,33.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my gosh."
33.0,49.0,Subject,"Yeah. But I've put myself in every situation, so it's kind of the price you pay. And then that was pretty much it. I don't know. And then kind of been recovering from that. Yeah. It's been a lot. Been a lot."
49.0,54.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. So how has it been being back with your parents?"
54.0,92.0,Subject,"It's okay. Not the best, of course, but yeah, it's okay. I think the worst about it is just the fact that I'm here. It feels a little annoying. But I think it's just nice to be able to not have to worry about everything all at once, kind of like there's some familial aspect of that, which is good. Yeah."
92.0,98.0,Interviewer,So what were some things that maybe you were worrying about before that kind of are off your plate now a little bit?
98.0,109.0,Subject,"Money. [laughter] I hate money. I hate it so much. I think it's the bane of all existence. But it exists and we need it, so yeah. That one's a crazy thought."
109.0,113.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, what it is about money that kind of is the bane of your existence?"
113.0,210.0,Subject,"Oh, I think it's the bane of all existence. I think it's just bad. I think money is bad, which is not great for me to say, but it's like a-- I think people can make the argument that without money, nothing would be done, but I think that with money, it just brings about greed and selfishness and tends to push people apart and get in between people more than it brings people together, and also, it can make yourself become broken up. It's so helpful and such a necessary tool that shouldn't exist. I don't know. It's kind of like-- what is it? I saw something on TikTok about an engine powered by water, and it sounds great, but if we powered an engine with water, like a car engine, that would make the Mad Max world exist because then, everyone would be talking about water, and it'd be about engines, and then it would make us use even more water, and they'd probably be using filtered water and not salt water, and that would make things even more confusing because-- and it would just be all this other stuff. So, in theory, yeah, money's great because then you can buy stuff, but underneath, it's not so good because it's just there. Yeah."
210.0,221.0,Interviewer,"That's such an interesting thought, thinking about kind of a primary resource or a thing that people rely on, how it changes people's motivations, maybe."
221.0,230.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely. And I have that-- it's like a stress ball [inaudible], but yeah."
230.0,242.0,Interviewer,How has that impacted kind of your experience? What experience have you had with money that has kind of illuminated this idea for you?
242.0,304.0,Subject,"Well, most of my stuff goes back to my dad and moving because we moved a lot when I was a kid. I didn't really have a stable childhood. I guess that's why I'm unstable now - I don't know - [to a point?]. But he would chase money for jobs and shit, and it led to a lot of confusion. And then, just looking at how other people reacted to money, being around them and just-- people say money doesn't cause-- you can't buy happiness. Money doesn't buy happiness. I mean, yeah, it's helpful, but it doesn't do it for you. And then it was just like a bunch of other things surrounding money. It's like, where does it come from? Whose was it before you? Does that matter? There's a bunch of questions with that that I haven't really thought about, but yeah, it comes about from being forced to move around because of that. Yeah."
304.0,315.0,Interviewer,And how did that moving around when you were younger impact kind of your current mindset about money or about other things?
315.0,321.0,Subject,"Well, I think-- so do you mind if I ask you a question?"
321.0,322.0,Interviewer,"No, not at all."
322.0,328.75,Subject,Okay. Did you grow up in the same place [inaudible]? Did your parents live in the same house the entire childhood? Yeah.
328.75,329.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
329.0,424.0,Subject,"So you had a system of, like, this is what is there, this is what you can do, this is what breakfast time is. So you have boundaries there. And yeah, there's boundaries [inaudible] in every place, but after each time we moved, there was something lost and little differences between people or differences in socioeconomic status of where we were at the time, and then it would change everything, for me, at least. I don't know if that was-- I don't think my family felt that way. But anyway, so I was just-- because of the moving, everything has a different lens that it can be seen through, and I've just been noticing that from a young age. And I think - what is it? - I guess after the seventh move, it just kind of gets to the point of, like, everyone has to deal with their own shit even though they shouldn't. And it's hard to deal with your own stuff while helping other people and vice versa. So yeah, it's kind of, yeah, [inaudible]."
424.0,435.0,Interviewer,"No, yeah. That makes sense. And could you say a little bit more maybe about kind of that socioeconomic difference that you found yourself in when you were moving from place to place that you mentioned?"
435.0,596.0,Subject,"Yeah. When we were younger, we lived in Dothan, Alabama. I was born in Nashville, then we moved to Dothan, and then we moved to the beach, and this area was-- I've talked about this before in a class, and I kind of got into it with another student about whether or not people were good, but this doesn't relate to that. It was like a-- we were in what is Christian Republican, and we're Jewish and not Republican, and so it's just-- going from there and then to Kentucky and going to a private school from a really poor, redneck public school where my friends would go shoot BB guns at each other for fun just because [that was it?], or play in giant dirt piles and run around the woods, which was-- it was so much fun playing Lacrosse and going to house parties. It was different. The people were-- as much as I want to say they're the same, they're not. Even the children, completely different, and that's five years of experience different in life, and that's not really even living. It's kind of just like existing. But yeah. It's small. It's small. The differences were [small?], I guess. But yeah, so moving around, there was just kind of a lot to take in, like all these little differences, because I wanted to fit in as best as I could, or at least be friends with people as best as I could, or relate to them as best as possible, and then I would pick up on the little things, and then I just stopped caring about school because I thought it was boring because people were more interesting. Yeah. And that goes back to money because these people with no money, they were all having such great times. I think we were more happy when we were living without money in the Panhandle than we were-- in the Panhandle of Florida than we were in Kentucky or New York or here so far, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just weird. It's just so different, each place. Yeah. Is that kind of what you were getting at?"
596.0,626.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. No. Totally, yeah. And when you're talking about-- so you're mentioning that there were differences in terms of the activities that these people would do and kind of the lifestyle, obviously, but you also kind of alluded to differences between the people or the types people or even the quality of people that you encountered in that way. How did that manifest, I guess, between the different places? How were the people themselves different?"
626.0,629.0,Subject,"When you say manifest, what do you mean?"
629.0,655.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, so you mentioned, for example, that they were doing these different activities, Lacrosse versus BB-gun fighting and that type of thing. But did that kind of yield a different person or a different type of person at the end of-- as they were growing up, did you feel like the children themselves, as people, were different in some ways, or was it more external to their activities that they were doing?"
655.0,760.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, of course, it's different. It's like that's the difference between our religions. Everyone has a basis of what's right and what's wrong, but it's like, even going from a neighborhood that's Episcopalian to Baptist, it doesn't seem that different, but it's very different, especially if you know the differences. And when people get older, I guess from my experience with getting older, from being young and noticing that to being, I don't know, 23 now, it's so-- I'm in this study, so I guess that's part of it, but it's a lot. Religion is a lot of it. People manifest themselves in ideas and ways that aren't really sane, I guess, because we don't really live in a sane world. I was talking to Shannon about this a second ago, but our world is very not sane. Our world is very insane, like the things that people do, the things that work, the things that happen. And I'm not saying it to be crazy, but it does help to notice it, and you just kind of have to [inaudible] [it in?]. Anyway, so when I lived-- I'll give you the list of where I've lived. I was born in Nashville, and I moved to Dothan, Alabama, and then to [Rosemary?] Beach, Florida. Actually, have you seen the Truman Show?"
760.0,761.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm.
761.0,765.75,Subject,"Yeah. So that was-- it's Seaside, Florida. I lived in that area."
765.75,766.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow."
766.0,771.0,Subject,"Yeah. So when I was 10, I watched that movie and was living there. That was weird."
771.0,772.0,Interviewer,That's so funny.
772.0,819.0,Subject,"Yeah. It is. Part of my paranoia comes from that. And then it was Louisville, Kentucky, and then from there, we went to Denver, and then from Denver, we went to Tampa, and then from Tampa, I moved to New York to go to school, and then halfway through my freshman year, my parents moved to Yonkers. And I moved to Paris for a semester, and then I moved back to Yonkers for COVID, and then they moved here. So all over. And here is Birmingham. But I guess what I was getting at from that-- what was the question?"
819.0,826.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, so we were talking about the differences that you encountered between the people from, basically, all these different places."
826.0,876.75,Subject,"Yeah. There's a lot of [that?]. Oh, goodness. Okay. It kind of becomes a religious thing, I guess is how I see it. Some people see it like that, too, I think, but it's-- I'm trying to use the words that you said to help explain it. Because manifestation is a really weird word to use for that, but it makes sense, and I want to use that and include it because I can. But, again, it's confusing. Can I ask you the same question?"
876.75,877.0,Interviewer,Can you--?
877.0,881.0,Subject,How would you answer that? Yeah. How would you answer that?
881.0,883.0,Interviewer,Can I answer it afterwards?
883.0,884.0,Subject,Yeah.
884.0,887.0,Interviewer,"I'll remember. I'll [crosstalk] [go?], and then I'll answer after, okay?"
887.0,1043.0,Subject,"Okay. Sounds good. Yeah. So I think the differences between people [from where I lived?] is just based on how you see yourself, how other people see yourself, and then, as an outsider from both of those who can see where other people are coming from and where you're coming from, plus there's gray space. It makes everyone seem more similar. I don't know. It makes everyone seem exactly the same, just patterns of the same different thing over and over and over to the point where it doesn't really matter. Even though they are still individuals, they're not very individual because it's the same person in like a different font. [laughter] But yeah. It's weird to think about it like that because in the religious aspect-- I'm not even going there. As a kid, what is happening in that situation is that people are trying to figure out who they are, and people are also trying to put things onto their kids and teach them who to be, and so I was seeing people learn who they are while I was-- my role was the one who would come in and leave, and so I didn't know what to do with all that. And so I was just kind of like this one person who would do whatever I wanted, pretend, and then leave, and then change. I was basically a grifter for the first 19 years of my life, and I hated it. It [fucking?] sucked. It was awful. And so, yeah, I think part of the reason I've gotten crazier instead of getting better was because I compartmentalized all that stuff, and opening it up meant to me fully going crazy and going out all the time just because it was just like, ""I'm finally free,"" and then it's closing back up again, but in the right spots, or resetting in the right way. So I think that's what's happening. Yeah. I don't know. Is that good?"
1043.0,1044.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Really good.
1044.0,1045.0,Subject,"Okay. Okay, cool."
1045.0,1056.0,Interviewer,"Was there ever a space that you felt, growing up, that was kind of allowing you to be some more constant version of yourself?"
1056.0,1064.0,Subject,The shower. Yeah. Yeah. [laughter] I mean--
1064.0,1076.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So did you feel like that was kind of one of the only places that you were able to try to reconnect with who you felt you actually were or becoming, I guess, at that time, throughout your childhood?"
1076.0,1084.0,Subject,"Yeah, always. Shower was always there. It's the best place to think. You're cleaning yourself up, and you don't have anything around you except for warmth, yeah."
1084.0,1097.0,Interviewer,"Yeah? Yeah. And so what were some of those strategies, I guess, that you were employing to kind of socially survive in all these different situations? How were you adapting?"
1097.0,1182.0,Subject,"Mirroring was always a big one. Saying yes. Basically, improv. Like, ""Yes,"" and, ""That's cool, and this is really cool too. Wow, that's so awesome."" [I mean, like?] false positivity. Even though it's not really false, it's fake. It's like, ""Fake it till you make it."" I don't know. I didn't really have problems with that. People enjoyed it, but it doesn't feel real after a while. Acting the entire time is basically it. Observing. Figuring out what things were where. When I was in a new classroom, I would always try and figure out where everything was so I looked like I had been there for years. So if I could close my eyes and picture it completely-- I can even still picture my classrooms from when I was a kid because I remember them because I was just observing everything. Oh, I try not to intimidate. I try to be helpful. Basically, being subservient and making sure people liked me. Pretty much just exactly that."
1182.0,1193.0,Interviewer,"No, I mean, that makes a lot of sense, honestly, and I'm at least somewhat glad that it was working to an extent, obviously, while still feeling fake, but [crosstalk]--"
1193.0,1245.0,Subject,"Yeah. It didn't feel fake until I started smoking weed. That's when it started feeling fake because I built myself up from nothing doing that. If I'd stayed sober, I probably would've been fine, but I don't know, something about doing all of that was just-- it was a lot. It was a lot in the wrong way. It didn't feel like me because I didn't know if that was me. I didn't want to be that person that was always happy for other people. I wanted to be someone that people could truly count on or rely on instead of being someone that was just there to support, like a giant cheerleader, even though it sounds really nice. Yeah."
1245.0,1255.0,Interviewer,So what's the difference in your mind between somebody who's truly there to support and someone who's kind of just there as a cheerleader?
1255.0,1349.0,Subject,"If someone is just there to cheer, there's nothing wrong with that. I guess sometimes it's needed. That's a good thing. But if I think-- or no. I think being there to support someone is also being there at the bad times, not just for the cheering part and not just for-- I don't know. I don't know how to answer that in that context. I guess it's just like, you shouldn't be there for someone who wouldn't be there for you, and if I was just cheering someone on, I would be doing it because I wanted them to cheer me on. It was transactional, and transaction is not good unless it's-- again, it goes back to the money thing. Yeah. Exactly. So it's like a-- I don't know. If any sort of relationship becomes, ""I'm doing this for you because I want it for myself. I want you to do the same thing for me. If I'm your biggest cheerleader, you should be mine,"" that sort of thing, it's not real, and I'm not going to do that for someone unless I know that's what I want to do for them for no other reason. [And that's?] a lot. Yeah."
1349.0,1350.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That makes--
1350.0,1363.0,Subject,"Or vice versa even. Yeah. And it doesn't mean cheerleaders shouldn't exist. Yeah, they're great, but-- I don't know. Yeah."
1363.0,1372.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. And so how did weed kind of come into the mix and impact the way that you were viewing your actions?"
1372.0,1546.0,Subject,"There was a point where, my senior year of high school, junior/senior year, I started smoking and drinking nightly just because I was bored and I couldn't sleep. I felt like an actor that was always on. I could never stop acting because I was acting, and then people were questioning, like, ""Is he gay?"" that sort of thing, but I wasn't. I just had my personality because I wanted to people-please because all that other shit. And then, I don't even know. That was weird. And then, yeah, so I just wanted to feel something, so I started smoking and drinking, and this was in a move from Denver to Tampa, and I loved Denver so much. It was great. Really cool place. Everyone was super nice, and I was doing really well there, mentally and friend-wise and everything. But then we moved, and that was, yeah, not good. And so, yeah, I just-- I think it was actually because we went on this camping trip, and I started talking to this girl who was moving. She went on this camping trip and then moved, but it was for the school, and it was before the school year started. And we talked for so much, and I finally connected with someone one on one, directly, and I was like, ""This is the craziest thing."" I was telling her things I'd never said before. And I was like, ""Is this normal? That's amazing."" And I think I was so in shock about what our [literal?] mental connection was that I was just like, ""Whoa, that's wild,"" and I didn't feel anything. I was just like, ""Wow, I said things,"" because I didn't know how else to do it. There wasn't any feeling or anything. I was just in shock that I was able to connect with someone like that, like real, and she wasn't holding back either because she was leaving, so it was just like a perfect situation. And then she left, and I was like, ""Whoa. What the heck? What am I supposed to do there?"" And so I was just drinking a lot, smoking a lot, but those made me think differently and feel differently, and then it just kind of escalated from there to doing different stuff, and then trying to prepare for going to college and all that other stuff, so yeah. I think that's kind of, I guess, what [you're going?] for."
1546.0,1554.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And so could you say maybe a little more about how it shifted the way that you were thinking and feeling at that time?
1554.0,1576.0,Subject,"It was a fully out-of-body experience for most of that year, so no, I can't. I can tell you what I looked like and what I-- I can describe you situations, but I can't tell you what I was feeling, no. Yeah, I thought I was dead for most of that year, so."
1576.0,1578.0,Interviewer,Wow. Wow.
1578.0,1595.0,Subject,"Yeah, and that was one of the delusions that I read about, but only after I had that. I've talked to Shannon about this quite a bit. But yeah, I thought I was dead for the entire time. It was very freeing. But spiritually, [I had died?], so."
1595.0,1597.0,Interviewer,Sorry. Spiritually? Can you say that last thing one more time? I didn't hear that.
1597.0,1608.0,Subject,"Yeah, spiritually, I definitely did die because I quit doing that acting thing and then started doing the-- yeah, you know, that's a spiritual death."
1608.0,1618.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So that was kind of the turning point for you in terms of the acting kind of moments towards moving, I guess, towards a more genuine existence."
1618.0,1619.0,Subject,Yeah.
1619.0,1625.0,Interviewer,"Wow. So - sorry - I'm realizing that I don't want to take too much of your time, so--"
1625.0,1628.0,Subject,"No, it's okay. I have nothing to do, so [you're fine?]."
1628.0,1631.0,Interviewer,Okay. Is all right with you if I stop the recording?
1631.0,1632.0,Subject,Yeah. That's fine.
