2.0,6.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,8.0,Subject,Good.
8.0,11.0,Interviewer,What have you been up to?
11.0,14.0,Subject,Nothing much.
14.0,21.0,Interviewer,"Just what's a typical day, or what are some types of activities that you've been doing?"
21.0,28.0,Subject,Nothing. Being with my mom and being here in the house.
28.0,34.0,Interviewer,That's great. And how is your relationship with your mom?
34.0,35.0,Subject,Great.
35.0,41.0,Interviewer,"Yay, that's wonderful. And are you guys living together now?"
41.0,42.0,Subject,"Yes, ma'am."
42.0,47.0,Interviewer,"Oh, nice. And so how is she doing?"
47.0,49.0,Subject,She's doing good.
49.0,53.0,Interviewer,Nice. And do you have any other siblings?
53.0,55.0,Subject,Yes. We're seven.
55.0,62.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my gosh. Seven. Wow. And do they also live nearby or with you?"
62.0,68.0,Subject,"No. They live in Dominican Republic, and the [inaudible] boys live in Spain."
68.0,76.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. And how is your relationship with all your other siblings?"
76.0,77.0,Subject,Good.
77.0,80.0,Interviewer,Good? Do you speak to them regularly?
80.0,81.0,Subject,Yes.
81.0,92.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. That's so nice. So were you living in the Dominican Republic or in Spain at some point?"
92.0,96.0,Subject,"I live in New York, but I was born [in?] Dominican Republic."
96.0,98.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you were?"
98.0,99.0,Subject,Yeah.
99.0,103.0,Interviewer,And how did you like living there?
103.0,104.0,Subject,In Dominican?
104.0,105.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
105.0,109.0,Subject,It was good. [But I prefer to live here?].
109.0,111.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you do?"
111.0,114.0,Subject,"I prefer living here, in New York."
114.0,116.0,Interviewer,"Oh, how come?"
116.0,122.0,Subject,Because it's better future here.
122.0,135.0,Interviewer,"There's a better future? That makes sense. Yeah. So, speaking of the future, what are some goals or plans that you have for your future?"
135.0,150.0,Subject,"For my future, I want to-- not right now, but sometime in the future, I want to get married, have children, and be a good relationship with my boyfriend."
150.0,167.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that sounds amazing. That sounds amazing. Having children, especially since you're one of so many, must be a really big part of how you see family and what family has meant to you over the years, right?"
167.0,169.0,Subject,Yeah.
169.0,183.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so cool. So can you tell me a little bit more about what it was like to live in the Dominican Republic and maybe some differences that you notice in New York?"
183.0,222.0,Subject,"The differences is the language, the food, tradition. In Dominican Republic, you have to sacrifice for everything, meaning that if you need the basic stuff, you won't have it there right away. In New York City, you have everything, meaning that if you have money, you could buy anything you want. But in Dominican Republic, it's hard for you to have everything."
222.0,241.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. So when you guys were in the Dominican Republic, did you feel that there was not enough money to go around, or that you were very struggling to kind of get the basics?"
241.0,243.0,Subject,Yes.
243.0,250.0,Interviewer,Yeah? And what did that feel like at the time for you and your family?
250.0,267.0,Subject,"No, that made me strong because God gave us the opportunity to come here and have a better future, and to help my family there, and to be a better person."
267.0,282.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. It's a very strong message that, when you're going through difficult times, it will get you through and make you stronger once you're on the other side."
282.0,284.0,Subject,Yes.
284.0,293.0,Interviewer,"Wow, that's really great. And so did you come to the US only with your mom or with other people from your family as well?"
293.0,296.0,Subject,"No, my mom only."
296.0,299.0,Interviewer,Only your mom. And how old were you?
299.0,301.0,Subject,I was nine years old.
301.0,308.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. Nine years old. So you've been here for a good number of years then."
308.0,310.0,Subject,Yeah. 28 years.
310.0,322.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my gosh. Wow. 28 years. That's amazing. And is that similar to how long your brothers have been in Spain?"
322.0,341.0,Subject,"No. One of my brother was born in-- well, one of my sister was born in Spain, and my other brother was born-- well, my two brothers was born Dominican Republic, but my father bring them to Spain."
341.0,345.0,Interviewer,"Oh, I see. So are they there with your father?"
345.0,346.0,Subject,Yeah.
346.0,355.0,Interviewer,"Oh, I see. Okay. And you still have some family in the Dominican Republic, or is everybody out [by now?]?"
355.0,357.0,Subject,Yes. I have uncles.
357.0,364.0,Interviewer,"Oh, uncles. Okay. So do you ever like to go back and visit them?"
364.0,372.0,Subject,"Yeah. Sometime on vacation time, I'll go there and visit them and [crosstalk] my sisters."
372.0,375.0,Interviewer,And also-- say that again? Sorry?
375.0,377.0,Subject,I spend time with my sisters.
377.0,382.0,Interviewer,"Oh, yeah. So how many sisters do you still have there?"
382.0,398.0,Subject,"I have five girl in Dominican Republic, two brothers in Spain, and one sister, the little one, in Spain, and me here. All together, we're seven."
398.0,418.0,Interviewer,Wow. And how did you decide that you would be the one to go to New York and some of your other sisters would stay in the Dominican Republic? How did people decide where they would go?
418.0,429.75,Subject,"Because my brothers, they half-brother. They're not with my mom, related."
429.75,430.0,Interviewer,I see.
430.0,444.0,Subject,"My siblings, that's from my father's side, not from my mom. I'm the only child for my mom. I'm the first, and then the rest of them with different womans. [They're not from us?]."
444.0,457.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that makes sense. I understand now. So you are the closest with your mom not only because you guys have a really good relationship but also because you're her only daughter, right?"
457.0,458.0,Subject,Yeah.
458.0,463.0,Interviewer,"Got it. Oh, my gosh. So you guys must be really close."
463.0,465.0,Subject,Yeah.
465.0,471.0,Interviewer,That's wonderful. And what are some activities that you guys like to do in New York?
471.0,491.0,Subject,"Well, not that much activity. We only like to spend time with the family, I mean, here. But right now, we're going through a lot, and God is good anyway."
491.0,496.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Would you be willing to share a little bit about what you guys are going through?
496.0,498.0,Subject,My uncle pass away.
498.0,503.0,Interviewer,Oof. I'm so sorry to hear that. Ugh--
503.0,504.0,Subject,Yeah.
504.0,514.0,Interviewer,--[that's very?] tough. I'm so sorry. Thank you for sharing that with me. That must be really hard. How are you guys handling it?
514.0,518.0,Subject,"No, we're good. I know he's in good hand."
518.0,528.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. And how was your relationship with your uncle?
528.0,529.0,Subject,Close.
529.0,532.0,Interviewer,Close? And is this your mom's brother?
532.0,533.0,Subject,No.
533.0,538.0,Interviewer,"Oh, no. How is he related to you?"
538.0,543.0,Subject,He was my aunt first husband.
543.0,551.75,Interviewer,Your aunt's husband. I see. I see. And was he in New York too?
551.75,552.0,Subject,Yeah.
552.0,555.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. So you probably saw him a lot."
555.0,557.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
557.0,578.0,Interviewer,"Oh, man. That's really sad. So what are some strategies that you and your mom have used to focus on the positive about his life and to heal a little bit?"
578.0,593.0,Subject,"Well, I spent time with him, and I gave him a lot of love when he was in life, and that's what make me happy, that everything that I did, I did it when he was in life, not when he was gone."
593.0,618.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Wow, that's so important. Yeah. It is often that there are people in our lives who are kind of taken for granted while they're in life, and then, when they pass away, we have regrets, and we're like, ""Oh, my gosh. I wish I saw him more."" That's so good that you really did that, and you seized the moment when he was around."
618.0,619.0,Subject,Yes.
619.0,635.0,Interviewer,"That's really great. So when you guys are hanging out with family, you and your mom and stuff, what are some traditions that you guys have brought back with you from the DR?"
635.0,654.0,Subject,"Well, we have a lot of traditions. In my country, we don't celebrate Thanksgiving, but here, we celebrate Thanksgiving, and that's a good way to thank God and to thank Him for everything that we have in life."
654.0,667.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. Totally. And what are some other traditions that maybe you still do even though they're not from New York, but they're from the Dominican Republic?"
667.0,679.0,Subject,"Celebrating the 27 of February, [foreign], like we say in Spanish."
679.0,680.0,Interviewer,And what is that?
680.0,684.0,Subject,That's the day of the flag [of?] our country.
684.0,690.0,Interviewer,"Oh. Yeah, that's really important. And does that have to do with independence or no?"
690.0,693.0,Subject,Yeah. The Independence Day.
693.0,698.0,Interviewer,"Oh, nice. Yeah. So that's kind of like our Fourth of July, then."
698.0,699.0,Subject,Yeah.
699.0,705.0,Interviewer,Got it. Cool. And what are some things that you guys do to celebrate?
705.0,717.0,Subject,"We [got the?] church of our flag, and we like to hear songs. The Carnivale is going on in the TV, and that's about it."
717.0,723.0,Interviewer,That's so nice. Do you guys play any instruments?
723.0,724.0,Subject,No.
724.0,726.0,Interviewer,Or sing or dance?
726.0,735.0,Subject,"One of my uncle from my father side, he play the trumpet. That's the way that you say?"
735.0,738.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, the trumpet? Or the trombone?"
738.0,741.0,Subject,[The trumpet?]. Yeah.
741.0,747.0,Interviewer,"That's fun. That sounds very grand and party-like, right?"
747.0,748.0,Subject,Yeah.
748.0,758.0,Interviewer,"That's so cool. And so - sorry - you said that you guys play music and dance, right? Is that what you said?"
758.0,759.0,Subject,[Yeah?]. Yeah.
759.0,767.0,Interviewer,That's so fun. And what other traditions or holidays are there in the Dominican Republic that we don't have here?
767.0,783.0,Subject,"We have that, and we have-- the thing is that I haven't passed time there, so I really don't remember that much stuff. That's the only thing that I can remember about."
783.0,785.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's okay.
785.0,795.0,Subject,"I passed the whole life of myself here in New York, so I know more tradition here than there."
795.0,803.0,Interviewer,Right. That's true. That makes sense. So what are some New York traditions that you started doing besides Thanksgiving?
803.0,804.0,Subject,Huh?
804.0,812.0,Interviewer,What are some New York traditions that maybe you started doing a little bit more besides Thanksgiving?
812.0,826.0,Subject,"Holidays. Christmas, Thanksgiving, my birthday. All of that."
826.0,838.0,Interviewer,"Oh, yay. Your birthday. That's so fun. How do you celebrate your birthday? What are some favorite things that you like to do?"
838.0,856.0,Subject,"To be honest, I don't celebrate my birthday. I just be with my mom - that's the only thing that I can thank God for - and be with my family, my close family. That's about it. I'm not very [choose?]."
856.0,858.0,Interviewer,You're not very what?
858.0,870.0,Subject,I'm not very picky about that. I don't like to be-- I don't like to be in that much party time.
870.0,875.0,Interviewer,"I see. Yeah. But it's nice to celebrate one day for you, right?"
875.0,876.0,Subject,Yeah.
876.0,883.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's nice. Maybe you can get just a little cupcake with a candle and make a wish."
883.0,884.0,Subject,Not really.
884.0,889.0,Interviewer,No? [laughter] Not for you? That's okay. Everyone has their own things.
889.0,891.0,Subject,Yeah.
891.0,904.0,Interviewer,"So when you guys are hanging out, do you guys like-- you and your mom, do you guys like to do any cooking, or are there any shows that you guys are watching that are really good?"
904.0,913.0,Subject,"I'm not very good in cooking, but I try my best to do what I like to do."
913.0,917.0,Interviewer,What are some dishes that you like to do?
917.0,929.0,Subject,"Well, the turkey, the Christmastime, and the [food, all that?]."
929.0,931.0,Interviewer,So more of the [inaudible] holidays?
931.0,934.0,Subject,"Yeah, the holidays."
934.0,939.0,Interviewer,"Nice. What's on the menu for Christmas, usually?"
939.0,940.0,Subject,Rice and beans.
940.0,942.0,Interviewer,Ooh.
942.0,944.0,Subject,Pasteles.
944.0,947.0,Interviewer,"Ooh, yum."
947.0,955.0,Subject,Turkey or pork. And ensalada rusa.
955.0,957.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Yum.
957.0,958.0,Subject,And that's it.
958.0,973.0,Interviewer,"Yummy, wow. Yeah, my boyfriend's family is from South America, so that's how I know some of your dishes and words and stuff like that, so. I also speak Spanish."
973.0,975.0,Subject,"Oh, you speak Spanish?"
975.0,977.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
977.0,978.0,Subject,"Oh, that's good."
978.0,995.0,Interviewer,"Thank you. Yeah, it's been really nice to speak Spanish because now I can connect a lot more with his family and especially his grandmothers and the older generation who maybe doesn't speak as much English. So that's [inaudible]."
995.0,996.0,Subject,That's good.
996.0,997.0,Interviewer,Thank you.
997.0,999.0,Subject,So you're bilingual.
999.0,1000.75,Interviewer,Yeah.
1000.75,1001.0,Subject,That's good.
1001.0,1008.0,Interviewer,"[crosstalk] my family is from Italy, so I also speak Italian. [laughter]"
1008.0,1009.0,Subject,Wow. [crosstalk].
1009.0,1028.0,Interviewer,"Those are my little tricks I have up my sleeve. [laughter] So you were saying - oh, yeah - your Christmas menu. Oh, my gosh. Yummy. And what about day to day? What are some favorite meals?"
1028.0,1032.0,Subject,"Well, I'm Dominican. I like my rice and beans, so."
1032.0,1033.0,Interviewer,"I mean, I hear you. They're so good."
1033.0,1036.0,Subject,There's nothing that could change.
1036.0,1039.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Rice and--
1039.0,1041.0,Subject,But [when my mama?] prepare it.
1041.0,1042.0,Interviewer,What'd you say?
1042.0,1045.0,Subject,My mom is the one that prepare that.
1045.0,1047.0,Interviewer,"Oh, she prepares it. Okay. That [makes sense?]."
1047.0,1048.0,Subject,Yeah.
1048.0,1054.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so nice that you live with somebody who will make all your meals. That [crosstalk] nice."
1054.0,1058.0,Subject,"[crosstalk] sometimes, but I don't know that much."
1058.0,1061.0,Interviewer,Maybe you can learn. Maybe that would be fun.
1061.0,1065.0,Subject,"Yeah, I'm going to try to do that on YouTube. I could learn more."
1065.0,1069.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. YouTube, you can learn everything."
1069.0,1070.0,Subject,Yeah.
1070.0,1078.0,Interviewer,"It's great. And also, you can record yourself teaching people how to cook your Dominican meals."
1078.0,1080.0,Subject,"Oh, that's fine."
1080.0,1089.0,Interviewer,"That's fun. And then, everyone can watch it and comment and be like, ""Wow, this is so yummy. I tried it."" It's really fun."
1089.0,1090.0,Subject,Okay.
1090.0,1092.0,Interviewer,Maybe that can be your new--
1092.0,1095.0,Subject,"I might try it, but I don't promise. [laughter]"
1095.0,1111.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Okay. So okay, so besides the activities that you do inside the house with your mom, do you guys ever go outside and explore together?"
1111.0,1123.0,Subject,"Yes. I like to go to the theater with my mom, listen to Romeo's concert."

1127.0,1128.0,Interviewer,That's--
1128.0,1132.0,Subject,"[When they went on tour?], I didn't miss one concert."
1132.0,1135.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my gosh. So good."
1135.0,1140.0,Subject,And I bring my mom and my aunt with me whenever I can.
1140.0,1143.0,Interviewer,Do you know the song Obsession?
1143.0,1144.0,Subject,Of course.
1144.0,1151.0,Interviewer,I used to play that every summer in [inaudible]. [laughter]
1151.0,1153.0,Subject,So you're a Romeo fan?
1153.0,1177.0,Interviewer,"I mean, I don't want to say I'm as much of a Romeo fan as you because you definitely know more than me. But it's funny, in Italy, they play a lot of songs in Spanish, and so they would play a lot of Romeo songs. And I just remember we would all dance to Obsession. We had a-- not choreographed, but there was a special dance for that song, so it stuck out in my [inaudible]."
1177.0,1179.0,Subject,Wow.
1179.0,1182.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you guys like to dance?
1182.0,1183.0,Subject,Yes.
1183.0,1187.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, so fun. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe you went to his concert."
1187.0,1188.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
1188.0,1191.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk] activities have you guys done in New York?
1191.0,1192.0,Subject,Huh?
1192.0,1197.0,Interviewer,What other fun activities have you guys done to explore a little bit?
1197.0,1205.0,Subject,"Well, we go to Rockefeller Center sometime [at?] Christmas. Not all the time because I don't like the [crowder?]."
1205.0,1207.0,Interviewer,Because you don't like the crowds?
1207.0,1208.0,Subject,Yeah.
1208.0,1211.0,Interviewer,Yeah? [crosstalk]--
1211.0,1229.0,Subject,"Do that, and sometime we go to the theater to see movies."
1229.0,1231.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, the movie theater, right?"
1231.0,1232.0,Subject,"Yeah, the movie theater."
1232.0,1236.0,Interviewer,Ooh. What's the last thing that you saw in the theater?
1236.0,1244.0,Subject,I think I was a baby when I went the first time. I see the Lion King.
1244.0,1245.0,Interviewer,So did you see the new Lion King?
1245.0,1254.0,Subject,"The Lion King and then the-- it was a movie going on, but I don't remember the name."
1254.0,1260.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I know. Sometimes it can be hard to remember. But there's a new Lion King movie. Did you see the new one?
1260.0,1261.0,Subject,No.
1261.0,1273.0,Interviewer,"Oh, it was really good. So you know how, in the old Lion King movie, they're all cartoons? In the new Lion King movie, it's like a real lion."
1273.0,1275.0,Subject,A real lion?
1275.0,1277.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, it's real animals."
1277.0,1278.0,Subject,"Oh, wow."
1278.0,1294.0,Interviewer,"Obviously, they're not real in the sense that they didn't train a lion, but they used 3D real animals instead of just 2D--"
1294.0,1299.0,Subject,"Wow, 3D. Okay. You're saying the 3D version?"
1299.0,1301.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, basically."
1301.0,1302.0,Subject,Wow.
1302.0,1315.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, it was really cool, and it seems really real. And the roar sounds really real and, I don't know, really cool. All the animals just look very realistic."
1315.0,1317.0,Subject,But that's for babies.
1317.0,1321.0,Interviewer,"No, but it's really good. And I think Beyonce sang in the new one too."
1321.0,1323.0,Subject,"Oh, Lord."
1323.0,1325.0,Interviewer,Do you like Beyonce?
1325.0,1326.0,Subject,Not really.
1326.0,1328.0,Interviewer,You don't? Okay.
1328.0,1331.0,Subject,Not really. I don't understand her music.
1331.0,1334.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Why don't you understand it? What does that mean?
1334.0,1337.0,Subject,She speaks too fast.
1337.0,1351.0,Interviewer,"Oh, yeah. [inaudible] Yeah, it's true. She [inaudible] really fast. There are some slower songs, but most of them are pretty fast. And also, she dances a lot while she sings, which I feel like is probably really hard."
1351.0,1353.0,Subject,I know.
1353.0,1370.0,Interviewer,"So yeah, movie. Oh, yeah, Rockefeller Center. Maybe if you go in between when they first light the tree and when it's actually Christmas, maybe there'll be less crowds."
1370.0,1372.0,Subject,You think so?
1372.0,1383.0,Interviewer,"I mean, I think there'll be a big crowd when they first light it and then another big crowd maybe around Christmastime, but maybe in between, it'll be a little bit more chill."
1383.0,1385.0,Subject,Oh.
1385.0,1408.0,Interviewer,"Or in the daytime when people are working more. I don't know. What else was I going to say? Oh, yeah. Are you guys doing any type of work or any projects or studies or anything like that going on in the background?"
1408.0,1409.0,Subject,The background?

1645.0,1647.0,Subject,Yeah.
1647.0,1650.0,Interviewer,What did he say?
1650.0,1666.0,Subject,"It was the first [crack?]. I mean, the first [match?], I think. That's how you say. When I saw him, I like him, but I didn't say anything to him."

1671.0,1672.0,Subject,Yeah.
1672.0,1676.0,Interviewer,Oh. That's so nice. And does he know your mom?

1677.0,1680.0,Interviewer,And how do they get along?
1680.0,1685.0,Subject,"They don't get along, but hey, that's part of life."
1685.0,1693.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's part of life. [laughter] [inaudible] that. What's the deal? Why don't they get along?"
1693.0,1694.0,Subject,They don't get along.
1694.0,1704.0,Interviewer,They just don't like each other? Darn. That's annoying. And how do you feel about that?
1704.0,1709.0,Subject,[It's nothing?] that I can do. Things happen.
1709.0,1714.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And does he live with anyone else or no?
1714.0,1720.0,Subject,"[At the?] time, yeah, to be honest. But now, he's not with that person."
1720.0,1722.0,Interviewer,"Oh, now he's not with that person. Okay."
1722.0,1724.0,Subject,"No, he's not [with?] that person."

1740.0,1741.0,Interviewer,That's bad?
1741.0,1742.0,Subject,"No, that's better."
1742.0,1747.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's better? [laughter] Why is that better?"
1747.0,1749.0,Subject,"Because that way, people don't know anything."
1749.0,1754.0,Interviewer,"Oh, true. And then your mom is not involved."
1754.0,1755.0,Subject,Exactly.
1755.0,1766.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That makes sense. Okay, well, I want to be really mindful of your time because I know we've already talked for 30 minutes. So I'll stop the recording if that's okay with you."
