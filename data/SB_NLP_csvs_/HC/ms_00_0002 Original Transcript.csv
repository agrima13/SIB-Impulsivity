0.0,38.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So, Yancy, thank you for taking the time to talk with me. Thanks for coming in today. So as I told you a little bit before, this part is sort of different than the rest of our study. It's different than maybe things you've done in other research studies. As I mentioned, our conversation's recorded by this microphone for analysis. And the purpose of this is really just to get to know you and to learn what your life is like. So how have things been going for you lately?"
38.0,43.0,Subject,They're all right.
43.0,44.0,Interviewer,All right?
44.0,56.0,Subject,Yeah. They're all right.
56.0,58.0,Interviewer,"So not good, not bad?"
58.0,83.0,Subject,"I mean, yeah. I would say that. I mean, some good things and some not particularly good things, but generally, okay. There's nothing really all that bad going on right now other than I have to do my taxes and nobody seems to be giving me the information I need, which is a big confusing hassle."
83.0,84.0,Interviewer,That's frustrating.
84.0,112.0,Subject,"Yeah. And I got to reapply to whatever financial aid program I qualify for, so. But then other than that, things are all right. I got a couple of jobs that might be coming up, and what else? My girlfriend got into a PhD program. So that's good. John Jay College."
112.0,112.75,Interviewer,Wow.
112.75,113.0,Subject,Yeah.
113.0,114.0,Interviewer,That must be really exciting.
114.0,141.0,Subject,"Yeah, for her. She's really happy. So things are going all right. That's about it. I mean, otherwise, I'm still reasonably healthy. Heavier than I should be. And yeah. That's about it. I'm going out and doing things. But, yeah. No, it's going all right. I mean, it could be better. It's going okay."
141.0,144.0,Interviewer,What kinds of things are you going out and doing?
144.0,318.0,Subject,"Let's see. What did we do last weekend? I do these midnight movies up at the IFC Center. We saw Silent Running, which is weird. It's the part inspiration for MST3k [inaudible]. And it was kind of a weird movie. It was a weird vibe. And we saw Jaws. Saw this thing called Kaiju Big Battel, which is like professional wrestling, but they dress up in monster costumes, and they set it up to look like a little city inside the rings. So these monsters are just fighting each other and destroying the city at the same time. My buddy, his wife's rich friend-- it's a real waste of space. But her rich parents bought a loft in-- I don't know. Whatever the hell. Down by-- what's that near? I'm thinking Chelsea. It was either in Chelsea or it's near Chamber Street. Somewhere in that area. Lower Manhattan. Bought a loft just to keep their artwork in. So these people are garbage. And his wife had to hand out with them there because they were in a little party and he didn't want any part of it, so we went to a dive bar and took my girlfriend around to this place called the Patriot. There's no business being down at Chamber Street. So that's what we did. We went down to the Patriot. It was all one day. So the night before, then the Patriot. So it was a busy weekend last weekend. Yeah. Stuff like that. I mean, I don't remember what we did the weekend before that. I cannot remember what we did the weekend-- oh, yeah. My girlfriend never had a sloppy joe before, so we got her a sloppy joe. We did that on Friday, so. What the hell else did I do the weekend before that? I can't remember what I did the weekend before that. Anyways, it was busy too, but I can't really relive it. So I think we went to [inaudible]. Man, I still can't remember what we did. We attempted to go to a movie, and I couldn't go to the movie. Did we go to a movie? We may have seen Omega Man. I feel like we might have, but needed to take a look at the schedule. I think we saw Omega Man. Yeah. [inaudible]. I honestly can't remember what I did the weekend before that, but that's the kind of stuff we've been doing."
318.0,320.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you like to see movies?
320.0,601.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, they do these midnight movies, and they used to do them at the Landmark Sunshine. The Landmark Sunshine's dead. So now you do all the midnight movies at IFC Center. It's the only real place that does midnight movies. Other than that, I mean, there's late showings of movies, but none of it's new stuff, so it's not worth the trouble. And Cinepolis, every Friday and Saturday does [inaudible] picture show with people reenacting what's going on in the screen right in front of you. That's a midnight movie. And the last vestige of the midnight showings that they used to have at the Landmark Sunshine, or at the Sunshine of 57th street, they'll show The Room on Saturdays at midnight, and that's about it. But that's pretty much it for midnight movies, so pretty consistently go to IFC center unless they don't have anything that we want to see. We saw 28 Days Later. I think that's what we did, because we were originally not going to go out and see a movie, then we saw 28 Days Later. That's what we did. We meant to go see The Room at the Landmark at 57th street, which is the most God-awful-- off of 57th and 12th Avenue. It's the most God awful part of the city to put a theater in. It's a very expensive looking theater. There was nobody inside of it for a God damned reason. It's right by the highway and right by the river, okay? And it's a cool mile walk from the nearest train, okay? So your options are-- and it's near high-rise office buildings under construction and a closed BMW dealer. There's like three closed car dealerships. I mean they're open, but by the time anybody's going to the movie, they're closed. So you're just walking by these closed car dealerships. Oh, so you walk down 12 Avenue, they don't have a sign. Some of these things where they have the business right here, and it's not in a building that looks like a theater particularly. And if you're smart, right, and you're walking down the street, nobody can see your business. You put a sign that goes this way, right? It's perpendicular to the street, so people say, ""Oh, the theater."" I was 30 feet away from it and I couldn't tell it was a theater. I had to text her. I was like, ""Are you there? Are you sure? She said, ""Yeah. I'm sitting in the theater."" So I have to get right in front of the theater to know that it's there. Understandably, it's completely empty. It turns out they used to show The Room on Fridays and Saturdays. Now they're just showing it on Saturdays. So they're probably going to phase it out. And then we just went home and drank whisky and watched crappy TV. It's what we do. And then the next day, went out to-- yeah. 28 Days Later. And she had never had a Lunchable. We had a Lunchable. She liked the Lunchable. She'd never had a Fig Newton. She hated the Fig Newtons. Absolutely despised the Fig Newtons. We saw 28 Days Later, and the next day we did a [inaudible] where she likes-- well, everybody likes puppies. I like puppies too. Well, she really likes dogs, so we go to pet stores and pretend we're going to buy a dog, and then that way you can just play with puppies. And then you can-- we did the same store we've done three times, and so we played with two puppies each time. She loves Pugs. I just have a wiener dog, and I grew up with Beagles. And the one place just has the little toy breeds. We did the little Shih Tzu for a while, which is all right. But then we did a Corgi, and we did-- it was like a Corgi and a Yorkie. I think it is a little Yorkshire Terrier. And then we did a boy Puggle, which is a Beagle and a Pug all mixed together. And then I think we did one with the Puggle and the wiener dog. And then we did a girl Puggle and Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu is a pretty dog, but it's not interested in you at all, so. And that's what we did. That's what we've done for the last few weeks. I've done that. Going out to movies. I think the weekend before that we went to some midnight-- oh, that was the weekend we went to Omega Man. And then on Saturday we went to Annihilation with my buddy Bird and his wife, and we went out to a bar after that. So that was a pretty busy week. So that's the kind of stuff we've done this month."
601.0,605.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Dogs. Movies.
605.0,631.0,Subject,"Yeah. So it's been dogs, movies, bars, [inaudible]. And then, yeah. That's everything."
631.0,633.0,Interviewer,So you spend a lot of time with your girlfriend?
633.0,758.75,Subject,"Yeah, on the weekends. She works at a-- it's not a law firm, it's a legal something society. It's a program-- basically, when you have people of minor offenses, things like shoplifting or jumping the [inaudible], something like that. So people of minor offenses. It's a program that's meant to intervene, to keep them from having a criminal record, right? So in the lieu of having some sort of criminal record that could potentially impair their employment or follow them for the rest of their lives, they participate in this program. Program I think advocates on their half with the courts to reduce the charges and to keep them from having permanent records. That kind of thing. So it's like old people shoplifting, and they got some cabby for [inaudible] a prostitute, but he might not have been doing it, he might have just had a prostitute in his cab and he didn't realize she was a prostitute and was driving around with her. I don't think he understood what was going on. He kept driving her to different places. Yeah. And that's pretty much what she does. And she works kind of as a translator. She worked as a translator before. So she sort of works as a translator, but then she also processes them, runs these-- they're sort of like groups where various people talk about the things that they did. So sort of assess their-- I don't know. Asses their case, give them advice going forward. But when she's not doing that, she's at my house over the weekend. So Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday night. And aside from that, I tend to hang out with my buddy Bird, because he's the only one who lives in the city. All my other friends are either in Connecticut. One's in Arizona. All my close friends from all those different places, so [crosstalk]."
758.75,759.0,Interviewer,You wish they were closer?
759.0,871.0,Subject,"Eddy Hussain, a good friend of mine, I think he's off in the Middle East. Eddy Housain-- his name isn't really Eddy, it's Hudi. He doesn't look Arabic, but he is. And last I knew, he was off- where is he, in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, or something like that? He goes around and he teaches at all these different schools. Because he has been in America for so long, his Arabic is weird, and also because he was educated in America. And he travels from all these different places. He always gets mistaken for being a spy. So he's had guns pulled on him when he's sitting there, and he's got a [inaudible] peep hole in these machine guns that will do them and everything. Yeah. Eddy's an interesting guy. A concert pianist and a real low-life too. Really into pills. Just a lot of really dirty stories of trashy women. Yeah. But he's off in Iraq. So all of my friends are just scattered all over. And my other friend is just-- yeah. She's got a lot of problems, but she's really smart. She's just a diabetic hoarder, and she used to just fill her house with filth. And as an odd job I'd go in there about once a month and get it half clean, take about eight hours. She'd pay me about 80 bucks. But she was really smart, so we'd sometimes hang out, see each other in town, or I'd call her on the phone now periodically. We'll have conversations, just check in, see how she's doing. That kind of thing. But again, she's off in Connecticut, so mainly I hang out with my buddy Bird. I hang out with my girlfriend. So that's pretty much it."
871.0,873.0,Interviewer,So your fiends are in Connecticut and--?
873.0,1032.0,Subject,"Some of my friends are in Connecticut like I said. Teeto's kind of a peripheral friend. He's in Connecticut. My friend Chris is in Connecticut. His wife's in Connecticut. Amy is in Connecticut. Eddy is in Iraq I think. My buddy Collin's driving an Uber off in Arizona. He's out there. I don't know why he's doing that. He was a Blackjack dealer. It's crazy. If you look at it, the aggregate is I think $3.37 an hour driving Uber. Yeah. After they calculate everything. I think they're assuming though that those guys are reporting their income on an [inaudible] calculations, so probably a little bit more than that. And certain places people make more, but on average, they don't make anything doing Uber. For the love of God, it's like an extra job that people do to pay off their credit cards if you're lucky. But he's a Blackjack dealer. I don't know why he decided to go to Arizona, for Christ's sake. Arizona's for old people and drug dealers. So Arizona, nobody else lives out there. Old people, drug dealers, and freaks with crystal shops, stuff like that. [inaudible]. It's the only people that live out there. There's no normal people in Arizona, and I know that because various members of my family live in Arizona for different periods of time. Incidentally, my aunt weighs crystals, and my grandmother is an old person. So yeah. He was living in West Virginia before that, so Arizona probably seems like, oh, God, Montreal or something to him. I don't know why if you're a Blackjack dealer, you can just go up to Connecticut, or go to Atlantic City or something. But go be a Blackjack dealer. Jesus. There's even a-- Metalman's Racetrack has a casino. There's a casino down in Baltimore. He can get work. What's he doing? Why is he off in Arizona? His dad's out there I guess. Who the hell wants to hang out with their dad when their 35, 34, whatever he is? I mean, when I see him every day. I don't know."
1032.0,1037.0,Interviewer,That's not how you would prefer to go about life with living?
1037.0,1092.0,Subject,"I don't know. I'm just saying, 34-- I mean, would that really be an incentive for your career? It's like, ""Oh, my dad's there."" I mean, nobody was in West Virginia. It's not like his family was in West Virginia. He lived there for years. And then his mom's in Connecticut, so wouldn't he be just as compelled? It just makes more-- Connecticut has two casinos. They do okay. So wouldn't you be more compelled to seek work at the two casinos than to go be an Uber driver in Arizona? Unless he just wants to see the country a little bit. But oh boy, make a whopping $7 an hour and live in Arizona. Don't get me wrong, it's snowy in Connecticut, but it's 6,000 degrees and boring in Arizona. What's in Arizona?"
1092.0,1093.0,Interviewer,The crystals.
1093.0,1205.0,Subject,"The crystals. The desert. Oh, big deal. Go to the desert one time, you're like, ""All right. That was a bad idea."" And then what was he doing? He goes to these-- I don't know what he's doing. He goes to these places. It's like he's systematically living in every part of the country, every God forsaken part of the country that nobody wants to live in ever. Go to Iowa next. For the love of God. I mean, not knocking against Iowa. I'm sure it's a lovely place, and I kind of like the Midwest, but-- even though it's illegal, you sometimes find a diner where people will be sitting there smoking and nobody gives a shit. I mean, it's cool. It's suspiciously friendly down there. Aside from that, yeah. I mean, [inaudible]. I can't hang out with all those guys. I see them every so often. Chris is actually out there visiting him, which I don't know how. Because Chris and his wife, I don't know what they're doing. They don't make $1 million, but hey, no student loan debt, no credit card debt. I don't think they're paying off a car. No mortgage. How much money do you need? And also, there in a cheapo part of Connecticut, you can get an ass of apartment with 2, 3 bedrooms in it for $600. So aside from that, what are they doing? What do they need? It boggles the mind. They never make money. And I understand she has a full-time job, he has a part-time job, sometimes hard to get time off, but they can't even drive down to New York ever for a weekend. They live in Arizona. So I don't know."
1205.0,1206.0,Interviewer,You wish they would drive down to New York?
1206.0,1286.0,Subject,"Yeah. I do. And they never can. I mean, we're going to hang out, or there's things to show them. They've been down there for six years and they only came down one time. That was for Bird's wedding. And you're talking, what? It's a two-and-a-half hour-- two, two-and-a-half-hour drive? It's not that bad. You come down, you park, stay for a couple days, and then out you go. My neighbor would be a good [inaudible]. It wouldn't be a problem. And they stayed with me during the wedding, so they don't have to pay any money for a hotel or a [inaudible] or anything. Bird's got a house. It's up in Yonkers, but who wants to stay off of Yonkers. Yonkers might as well be a Long Island. Who the hell wants to go there? Technically, I live on Long Island. It is Brooklyn, but who wants to go to Long Island? No one wants to go to Long Island. To go to Long Island, you have to have a reason. You don't go to Long Island voluntarily. It's not like, ""Hey, let's have a party. Let's go to Long Island."""
1286.0,1290.0,Interviewer,So what else is it like to be you?
1290.0,1371.0,Subject,"I don't know. I don't know. I do a lot of these studies. I'm at 279 with that. I haven't really done anything big though. I've been doing little university things. Nothing with medication recently. Little stuff. I did a couple studies with the business department at Columbia not too long ago. And then I had to do the-- I had done, before I did stuff with you, I did a colonoscopy study, and I had to do the follow-up visit for that not too long ago. I mean, it wasn't all of the money in the world, but it helps them out. You get a free colonoscopy out of it. It turns out everything's good down there, but it's the first time I have ever been put completely under. I've never been put completely under before. It was an interesting experience. It wasn't disconcerting at all. It's weird though. It's like a real deep dream of sleep and a minor head rush, and out you go. Not even a second, you're just completely shut off. So yeah. That's basically what I'm doing."
1371.0,1375.0,Interviewer,So what's it like doing these studies?
1375.0,2314.0,Subject,"To be honest with you, it's interesting. You make some money, but it's really kind of a hassle. I feel at this point, between-- I've done 17 in-house pharmaceutical studies with a medication. I've done a few other outpatient studies with medication through universities and hospitals. Beside from that, it's been 200 and, oh boy, probably 50. All kinds of studies. Start-ups, think tanks, schools, hospitals, you name it. All kinds of research institutions have done. All variety of things that you can think of. Places where they're trying to work on identifying people by their irises, by their fingerprints. I think something else where they're trying to identify people by the topography of their hands. Spinal taps. But I will tell you this, I feel at this point I could work as a consultant for these places to streamline the way that they interact with the participants. And I do have a minor background. I've taken research methods courses. I was a psych major about a million years ago for a little over a year, and I did take three statistics courses. [inaudible] APA format, [inaudible] SPSS. I did put together a small study. I administered a tool that did research methods for political science, which just switched over to [inaudible] research methods. And my graduate studies-- for media studies, I did ethnography. So I've done all of this stuff. I know a little bit about the scientific end and what you're looking for, and what those priorities are. But I feel that there's a chasm, there's a disconnect, an epistemological disconnect between researchers, and not in a malevolent way in participants or subjects. And I think that miscommunication causes a lot of inefficiency. Pharmaceutical studies, they make-- the last one pharmaceutical study I did, it was split up into four different legs over the course of a month and a half. And at the end of that what you generally get is a partial pay. And the reason that you get the partial pay is so that you can kind of live, because it's all spread out over a month and a half, but also so that you can pay for your own transportation, and pay for your transportation so that you can go home and come back again in a week, or two weeks, or whatever. Oh, we did one, and it was, I think a total of $2,500 and they were only going to pay us $400 over the course of a little over five weeks. So five and a half weeks. And no matter how much we explained it to them-- firstly, the language in the informed consent was vague. It caused a lot of confusion. No matter how much we explained it to them that that's a problem, they were just totally uncomprehending of the idea. ""Well, what do you mean? You're going to get your money at the end."" Well, who can live off of $400 for five weeks?"" And the problem is you're not supposed to be participating in any other pharmaceutical studies while you're doing that. But what you're doing is incentivizing people do exactly that. Or you're incentivizing them not to come back, just to get paid the prorated rate for what they've done and find something else. That easily could have been avoided if they had a veteran participant to consult with, who would have told them, ""Hey, by the way, this partial pay is way too low. You're going to have--"" and they're going to go, ""Well, it's in the informed consent."" It's like, ""Well, they're not lawyers."" You're lucky if these guys have an eighth-grade reading comprehension, an aggregate. And they're going to just peruse this. They're going to look at scary side effects, and then they're going to look at the money, and then they're going to look at the schedule, and then that's about it. And if they do look at the money, any nuances, they're going to be lost on them. So this isn't going to fly. You're going to have a lot of trouble on this. I even suggested too-- one day I walked right out of the study because of it, and I even suggested to the coordinator that, ""You know, maybe in your team you should have a veteran participant as a consultant,"" and she laughed at us. And another guy said, ""What are you talking about? That's a great idea."" There's another guy that's going to be a participant. University studies, one of the biggest things I deal with is they don't tell me where to go. I have to drag it out of coordinators, and when they want to tell me everything else, they'll tell me the science. They'll tell me every procedure that's going to happen to me. But to be honest, I don't really care, because for one thing-- I mean, it's great that you're telling me the procedures, but unless it's something really exotic, I don't care. And whatever description you give me, it's not in any way going to match what actually happens when I get there, and then everybody knows that things get switched around and they're fluid. So the best indicator what's actually going to happen is what happens while you're there. What is important to me is I need to know where to go. And I have to drag this, I mean, literally drag it out of people. Sometimes I get eight emails sent to an exchange before I finally get an address. Also, they do stuff where they'll tell me-- oh, they don't tell me the room number. So they go, ""Oh, just go to the security guard and tell him the name of the lab."" And it will be some big hospital. And I go and I tell the security guard, and goes, ""I've never heard of that before in my life. Do you know the number? If you don't have the room number, I can't let you in."" That's happened to me before. Another thing is you'll have places that are outside of New York that do research, but then they put an ad on Craigslist, right? It will be maybe upstate or some surrounding area, or maybe down in Connecticut, whatever. So you put an ad in New York City Craigslist, meaning that you're trying to pull participants from Craigslist, but they have no idea what transportation you should take to get there. Please sit down with Google Maps for an hour. You don't have to spell everything out, but it's just going to make everything better for everybody. Or, I mean, Zucker Hill Hospital. Zucker Hill Hospital does their cognitive testing at the hospital, then they do their MRI testing in a little facility in Manhasset. It's a couple miles away. You can't really walk it. Now, one time, I did the MRI first. It was a multiple leg study. I did the MRI first, then I had to go over to the hospital for cognitive testing. For some inexplicable reason, even though it's a nine-minute drive, they don't drive you. They tell me to take the bus. So I get on the bus, which I had to wait for 20 minutes, got, I don't know, a quarter of a mile down the street, broke down. I had to wait 45 minutes for a second bus. Google Maps told me to get off to connect with another bus. Where Google Maps told me to connect, there is no other bus. So then I had to walk a mile anyhow to the hospital. Nine-minute drive took an hour and a half. And usually what they do when I go the other way is they get me an Uber. Well, one time the girl said, ""Well"". So I got handed over to another coordinator. She goes, ""How did you get from the hospital to the MRI place every other time?"" And I told her, ""Well, they got me an Uber."" And she goes, ""Oh, no. I don't think they do that."" I said, ""Well, they did it."" And she goes, ""Well, I'll have to look into that."" So I go over to the cognitive testing and meet with her for about a second. She goes, ""Okay. You're to meet with this lady who did the matrix test with the blocks and all that."" The matrix lady goes, ""Okay. You're done. Go over to the phlebotomist. Go to the phlebotomist."" Takes my blood. He goes, ""Okay. Sit on this bench and wait for this lady, the coordinator."" Sit on the bench, wait for the lady, doze off. 45 minutes later another lady comes in. The lady that did the matrix test. ""What are you still doing here?"" ""Well, I'm waiting for the lady. The phlebotomist told me to sit down."" ""No. You're supposed to be over at the MRI facility."" Turns out that they weren't going to get me an Uber. They want me to take the bus. Nobody ever told me that. But the point is-- all right. Another study I did was at Stony Brook University, and the guy new the train to take. He said, ""Okay."" He knew exactly the train to take. But then I said, ""Well, how do I get to the actually University from the train station?"" He said, ""There's a bus, but it's a pain in the ass. I'll just come out and get you."" And it worked out perfectly for everybody. He got his participant on time. He got his research. There was an MRI component that's expensive. You've got to get a team together. He was assured that I was there on time as needed because he took the time to go to the train station, and to get me, and to drive me back. It's also a nice courtesy. So that kind of thing versus Zucker Hospital, who, by the way, had to cancel two MRIs because the lady wouldn't help me out. And then in the end, they apparently have a slush fund, and they actually got a cab to go all the way to my house, and then to drive me there, and to drive me back. Had to have cost them hundreds of dollars, all of which could have been avoided if she'd just spent 10 bucks on an Uber upfront. These are the basic things I deal with. Or hey, another thing. ""You guys are paying with cash. Great."" Straight forward. Some people pay me with a little weird debit card, and then you ask them, ""How does this--"" I know how they work now. I know how they work better than most researchers. And I'll go, ""How does this work? What banks-- can I get the money off of this? Can I go into the bank and actually get a transfer?"" ""I don't know. I don't know."" "" How do I use this at a store?"" ""I don't know. I don't know."" ""You have absolutely no idea how to utilize the unit of payment that you're giving to somebody. That's a problem. Maybe you should call the company, do the 10 minutes of research so that you can find that out."" This and many other things that I kind of-- also, I did one study up in the Bronx. They were looking at genetic markers in your fat, and it was something for aging. Now, I've had biopsies before. And they say, ""Oh, you're going to have a biopsy"" I say, ""Oh, okay. Great. No big deal."" And my idea of a biopsy - because I've had a few of them - is they snip a little bit of skin, they do a butterfly stitch and it's no big deal. So he takes out a four-inch wand and he's just ramming it under-- I mean, there's local anesthetic. But he's just ramming it under the skin of my abdomen subconsciously, and this guy is sucking fat out of a syringe and blood. I got a huge bruise in my stomach like that for two weeks. Please explain the gravity of that? I mean, in gory detail too, by the way. Like, ""Look. We're going to take the four-inch wand. I'm going to just be shoving it in there? Are you okay with that? It's not going to hurt, but it's a little bit much you might have a very big bruise."" They totally undersold that. I mean, pharmaceutical companies do it too. Where I was going to do a study off in Frontage, and it was $4,000. It was going to be over the course of-- I think it was two or three months. Something like that. I figured, I was in grad school at the time. That's pretty good money to supplement my income. And it was part-time so I could do it while I was in school. But I guess testosterone-- or prostate cancer is testosterone reactive, so it eats testosterone, basically, and it grows. So what they try to do is lower your testosterone level. It starves the prostate cancer. It helps to cope with cancer. So it was a drug to lower your testosterone level. That's what they told us. And they told us some of the side-effects. What they didn't tell us is that it is chemically identical to the drug which is used to chemically castrate sex offenders, and that it would actually lower our testosterone to a sub-castrate level, meaning that we're going to cut your testicles off. Right now you'd have more testosterone in your body than we would have had. And most women presently have more testosterone in their body than we would have had. That's the kind of detail you need to provide, otherwise, by omission, it's a little misleading to just sort of say, ""Oh, it will lower your testosterone a little bit, or you might have some hot flashes."" Please tell me it's the same medication that they use to chemically castrate rapists and pedophiles. Were I to mutilate myself, I'd actually have more testosterone in my bloodstream. But these are the kinds of things that I deal with. It's a little bit of a hassle, really, to do all of these studies, but it's also interesting. Sometimes it's a little bit fun. I have fascinating experiences that I would not otherwise have anywhere else. Sometimes it's boring. Also, I went to The New School, and as liberal of an institution as it is, the science denialism there was as writhe as you would find with any hardcore evangelical fundamentalist. I really, truly mean that. I was told that science was a discourse of power that was utilized to marginalize minorities. I was told that it was a grand narrative that was similarly used to marginalize minorities, never mind the history of science, which does the opposite. I was told that science operates from a perceived perspective from nowhere of pure objectivity and pure objective correctness, which is in no way of the scientific method works. I mean, read your Karl Popper, for Christ's sake. It can't be a scientific idea unless it's open to future falsification, meaning that it's never fundamentally true. No single scientific idea's ever fundamentally true. It's about uncertainty reduction. So being in an institution that preferred Lacanian psychology to [inaudible] linguistics to going on JSTOR store and seeing what's going on right now. Science denialism bothers me deeply. This is a way that I can contribute to science in some meaningful way. I have a very blank medical history. I make a very good control for any disorder or condition that you can think of. I do well in an MRI. I'm fine in a PET scan. There's no metal or anything in my body. There's no stents. Never had any surgeries. Don't have any medical conditions, so I'm very good to help learn about all these different symptoms, and--"
2314.0,2315.0,Interviewer,You see it as a service to science.
2315.0,2682.0,Subject,"Yeah. I do see it as a service to science. It's a way of-- yeah, of contributing to understanding of the world. And you name it, in one way or another, I made some sort of contribution. Borderline personality disorder, eating disorders, OCD, theory of mind, deficit disorders of some-- autism spectrum disorders, depression, schizophrenia, male fertility, understanding of vision, understanding of memory. All of these different systems. Genetic markers for schizophrenia. Genetic markers for aging. Boy, diabetes. Medications to help diabetics, medications to help cancer patients, medications to help people with nerve pain. So you name it. The only few areas I haven't worked in, is I have never done anything microbio. I wouldn't mind doing that. That would be interesting. Also, you learn a lot about yourself. For instance, I have a perfectly clean colon. Didn't know that. No polyps whatsoever. That's good. I hear better out of this ear than that ear. I'm much more right-handed than I knew I was five years ago. I see better out of this eye than that eye. Apparently was exposed to Lyme Disease on two different occasions, but I guess asymptomatically, which is weird. Yeah. I'm very good at counting backwards from 2,100 by 13, which I did better than anybody that they had ever run. Yeah. Oh, my blood coagulates within an average-- it's within an average range, but it's on the slower end, which is actually good for you, because it means less likelihood of strokes, and embolisms, and blockages of all kinds. So there's that. But you learn all kinds of weird things about yourself doing this stuff. And I've got pictures of my brain, and movies of my brain, which were sent to me by researchers. I've seen the interior of my lung. A cranial neurologist said I have stellar spinal fluid. That's good to hear. Yeah. All kinds of things. I don't presently have any cavities. I found that out through research. I got a full psych evaluation from The New School, because they have to teach the PhD students how to administer cognitive and psych tests. Not a lot of financial compensation, but really, it's just getting the battery of tests. It's eight hours of tests. So you get a full evaluation of personality. I do pretty well on IQ tests. I found that out doing the Waze abbreviated and full-scale. I could have submitted to full-scale to Mensa and they would have taken that, but what wound up happening-- and who wants to be a member of Mensa, by the way. It's like being a member of [inaudible]. But there was some sort of mistake with the pattern-- not the pattern [inaudible]. It was the one where you're translating the symbols. They do it in the matrix too where you're just translating the symbols and the numbers. Apparently, there's some sort of problem with the scoring on that, so I couldn't-- and they don't take the abbreviated, so I found that out. So you find all these things out about yourself. But I also know, whenever they have those tests where it's a bunch of-- it's like a field of static dots, and they're kind of swirling, or some are moving, I can't do that test to save my life. Let's see, you're supposed to determine what orientation, what direction the dots are moving in. I can't do that to save my life. I absolutely can't. Also, I'm very resistant to the transcranial stimulation. They have to put it to the highest setting. It does work, but they have to put it way up to the highest setting, and then it works just very minimally for whatever reason. And then you do a lot of weird things, like run on a treadmill with a thermometer in my rectum. I had to masturbate for science. I had to have scrapings of my lungs taken. I had to drink. I've had to do Adderall. I've taken Ketamine. So gamma scan, the PET scan. You guys did some scan on me and it measures the fat in your body. You get a full fat readout. It's like a fat ghost, and it's an outline of your body, and it's like, ""You're fat, fat, fat, you're fat here."" That's all that is. Yeah. So scanned, and punctured, and all kinds of fluid has been taken."
2682.0,2684.0,Interviewer,Yeah. You learn a lot of different things about yourself in different ways.
2684.0,2941.0,Subject,"Absolutely. Yeah. I have very clean ears too, which is weird. I got a bean stuck in my ear when I was I kid. I was five. And the doctor said part of the reason it got lodged in there is because I had a lot of wax. And I guess that's fine now. No wax. They go in there, they say, ""You have beautiful ears. They're fine. There's nothing wrong with your ears."" So that's good to know. I have to get a physical too 8 times, 10 times, more, a year. So universities give me physicals, and then these pharmaceutical places give me physicals. I have physicals all over the place. So I will tell you though, doing this, universities and hospitals, Mount Sinai, Columbia, etc., they have much better laboratories than the places that run the pharmaceutical testing. Make far less mistakes, far less false positives. I've been told twice that I had hepatitis C. I don't. Don't worry. I have a doctor's report. I'll show you later. I've been told-- I had this thing placed on me within the span of two weeks, I had a hypermanic and a hypomanic thyroid. Not sure how that works. I don't. Been told that I was symptomatic of epilepsy, but that was from a place that-- I don't understand this. They're often newer. They're giving people an epilepsy medication. So they wanted to know if people had latent epilepsy because it triggers a seizure if they give them this medication. So I did a test. It's an EEG with a flashing light. Now, I'm sure a fellow such as yourself or whomever's in some neurology department, or a beleaguered grad student, surely could use the money were they to bring them in as a consultant and have them do the EEGs. But no, they didn't do that. They had the doctor who didn't really know what he was doing, hastily train a nurse's aide to administer an EEG, something that she does not ordinarily do. Somebody's a step up from a phlebotomist doing an EEG. They put the cap on me, one of the electrodes didn't light up. She didn't really know what she was doing. And then, of course, something was wrong with the EEG. They call me back and do it again, because it's the only one that fits my head. They put the defective cap on a second time. The [inaudible] doesn't light up. They're like, ""Oh, crap. We've got to change that. Oh, it's such a pain in the ass to change a cap. We don't want to do it."" They go walk over to the [inaudible], it lights up, and they're like, ""Ah, good enough."" Then they run my EEG, and I get a call from the doctor, ""Oh, by the way, you might want to go to the neurologist."" I said, ""Well, I don't need to go to the neurologist, buddy. I go to the neurologist about 20 times a year. I've been evaluated for all this stuff. I'm fine. You need to get a neurologist to administer your EEGs."" So I will say that you guys tend to have far more accurate testing, far more accurate laboratories. I've only ever had to repeat labs one time with all the universities. I do far more research with the universities and the hospitals. The pharmaceutical places, it's 25% of the time they have to redo the labs, and on top of that, about 25% of the time, they tell you have things that you turn out not to have. I don't know who they were using, but they're certainly a lot less competent than universities and hospitals. I mean, it's fun and it's interesting. There's a lot of misconceptions about medical testing. You hear from people-- firstly, they think that they'll just take anybody. They think that what they're doing is just some bedraggled drug addict. I mean, there are some studies that specifically want that, but they just think that they'll take any kind of scabrous leper off the street. And then they'll just inject Drano into their eyeball and go, ""[inaudible]. That will fix cancer."" No. No. Not how it works, so."
2941.0,2950.0,Interviewer,"So Yancy, we're getting close to time on this, but is there anything else that I didn't think to ask you about to understand what it's like to be you?"
2950.0,3013.0,Subject,"I don't know. I mean, it's frustrating. I got a Master's degree and I'm borderline unemployable. So that's frustrating. But aside from that, I'm healthy. My family lives in Minnesota. That's good. I don't know have to deal with them. And I mean, I wish the kids lived over here, because my nieces and nephews are cool. It's just not everybody else. Yeah. I wish my friends were closer, but it's good enough. I'll take Bird? He's a cool guy. New York is a pain in the ass, but it's also pretty cool. I feel like anybody who's not ambivalent about New York has probably only been here for two months and a moron. So yeah. I mean, that's pretty much the whole of it. I mean, I think they're all right. I could be better."
