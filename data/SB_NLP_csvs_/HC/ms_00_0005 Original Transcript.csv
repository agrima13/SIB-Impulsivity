8.0,38.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So we can go ahead and get started. As I said, we're audio recording the conversation. And the point of this part is just to hear a little bit about your life and just to sort of get a sense of what it's like to be Shayna. So could you say, I guess, start off maybe how things have been going for you lately?"
38.0,41.0,Subject,Things have been going really good.
41.0,43.0,Interviewer,And what have you been up to?
43.0,50.0,Subject,"Right now, I recently started working at a dance studio."
50.0,52.0,Interviewer,What's that been like so far?
52.0,60.0,Subject,Really fun.
60.0,61.0,Interviewer,So what do you do at the dance studio?
61.0,75.0,Subject,"I'm in teacher training so I can be an instructor. But right now, I just assist. And yeah. Pretty much I just assist with the current instructors. And then I take class."
75.0,77.0,Interviewer,You take classes?
77.0,80.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
80.0,84.0,Interviewer,What are their classes like?
84.0,89.75,Subject,"Well, it's exotic dance, so the ones you can level up in is like lap dance and floor work."
89.75,90.0,Interviewer,Level up?
90.0,118.0,Subject,"Yeah. So like you have level one, two, three, and four. By four, you're like a master. But then we also offer twerk. We offer flexibility classes. We offer-- my favorite class is [inaudible]. So it's like pilates, but you do it in heels. I love that. And all sorts of classes, twerk. Yeah. It's pretty nice paced, the classes."
118.0,120.0,Interviewer,Have you been enjoying it so far?
120.0,123.0,Subject,Yeah. Sometimes I take class 10 times a week.
123.0,124.0,Interviewer,10 times a week.
124.0,142.0,Subject,"I mean, sometimes I do have to just sit in because I'm also learning what the structure of the class is and how to teach it and try to formulate my way of teaching it. But then sometimes I just go in even when I'm not scheduled to work or whatever, or I just sit in, and I just take it one day at a time. I love it there."
142.0,145.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It sounds almost like you've found a new home there.
145.0,145.75,Subject,Yeah.
145.75,146.0,Interviewer,Do you think so?
146.0,148.0,Subject,Yeah. Definitely have.
148.0,170.0,Interviewer,That's really wonderful. So what do you enjoy about it? What do you think makes you like it so much so far?
170.0,205.0,Subject,"I think I'm really shy in real life. Different scenarios, I'm pretty shy. And I feel like when I'm there, I don't feel shy. It's like I just know that we're all here for the same reason because you have some people there, and I'll take pictures or videos of myself, and you can tell like they have a corporate job, and they don't want anyone, their co-workers, their family to know. And they're like hiding from the pictures and stuff. But it's just like-- I don't know, it's just different than my usual. So I just feel like I feel more free there. Yeah."
205.0,206.0,Interviewer,You feel more free there.
206.0,211.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't know, I don't feel shy when I'm there for some reason. I'm shy in real life."
211.0,218.0,Interviewer,"So you feel like, in the rest of the world, you're kind of shy?"
218.0,219.0,Subject,Yeah.
219.0,220.0,Interviewer,"But there, you feel more free and less shy."
220.0,230.0,Subject,Mm-hmm. And I also like dancing. I never used to do it before. But I really do like dancing now.
230.0,231.0,Interviewer,You discovered that you really like dancing.
231.0,245.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't know if I think of myself as a dancer. I don't know, sometimes I just think of things as hobbies, and people are like, ""Oh, you're good at that."" But I just think of it as a hobby, and I don't really take it serious. So I think I take it more serious here."
245.0,247.0,Interviewer,So before you felt like it was a hobby.
247.0,248.0,Subject,Yeah.
248.0,249.0,Interviewer,And now you feel like you're taking it more seriously.
249.0,284.0,Subject,"Yeah. And I feel like it's connected to everything that I do. Like I already do yoga. I'm already pretty flexible, so it's just easy like it just all goes together. And I've met some really interesting people like I want to be a doula, and I met this girl who's actually a doula. Yeah. It's really nice. You just meet all different kinds of people from different walks of life, all ages too because there's this lady in my class, I think she's like 50. I swear, she's like 50. And you should see her twerk. And it's just so adorable, but everyone is there, people that you just wouldn't expect to be there, they're just there."
284.0,289.0,Interviewer,So you feel like it's been a way of meeting a lot of different kinds of people that you wouldn't have met otherwise.
289.0,302.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's just like who knew someone like this would be here, or from like all different walks of life. It's fun."
302.0,304.0,Interviewer,So you want to be a doula?
304.0,306.0,Subject,Yeah.
306.0,309.0,Interviewer,What do you think that'll be like?
309.0,344.0,Subject,"Scary, but I don't know. I think it kind of goes with everything that I like. It's like a birthing coach. So I am certified in nutrition, plant-based nutrition, so I can offer that. And May 20th, I go for my training for-- it's pretty much prenatal yoga so I can teach expecting moms how to do yoga. So that kind of goes with everything that I like already. And I love babies. So [inaudible], but I don't want to see them being born. I just want to help give them directions, stuff like that."
344.0,346.0,Interviewer,So you help during the birthing process.
346.0,364.0,Subject,And post if they need me. I would do-- I guess you'd call it it's a birthing doula and a postpartum doula. So I want to be both. And lactation specialist so I could teach them what to eat so they produce enough breast milk and also assist them on how to comfort the baby and make it comfortable for them.
364.0,368.0,Interviewer,Wow. That's wonderful.
368.0,373.0,Subject,Yeah.
373.0,375.0,Interviewer,Have you known for a while that you wanted to do that?
375.0,383.0,Subject,I think like a year now.
383.0,395.0,Interviewer,"So you feel like that kind of career would bring together some stuff that you've already known working on, and then nutrition was something that you always thought would be really cool?"
395.0,407.0,Subject,Yeah.
407.0,414.0,Interviewer,So dancing has been exciting lately. What else?
414.0,417.75,Subject,My goddaughter. I love her so much.
417.75,418.0,Interviewer,Your goddaughter. Yeah.
418.0,420.0,Subject,Yeah.
420.0,422.0,Interviewer,What it's been like having a goddaughter?
422.0,437.0,Subject,"It's amazing. It's like, I don't know, it's like I don't know what it's like when she wasn't here. I can't imagine her not being here. Every day, she's doing something new like she's walking, she's saying ""Mama"" now. It's just crazy."
437.0,438.0,Interviewer,Wow. She's talking.
438.0,458.0,Subject,"Yeah. She says ""Ma."" And I don't know, she obsessed with her dad, and you see her like crawl over, she holds hands with him. It's just so cute. Yeah. So cute. And that kind of made me want to do prenatal yoga because I said I want to one day host my own Mommy & Me for my friend."
458.0,459.0,Interviewer,Host your own Mommy & Me.
459.0,471.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's like mommy and baby yoga where you can bring your baby because my friend-- you know, sometimes it's hard to work out and do things when you have a baby. So just I want to make sure that they're incorporated too."
471.0,477.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you like stretch the baby [laughter]?
477.0,485.0,Subject,"Yeah. There's a move that's called Happy Baby, and it's when the baby-- you know how they usually hold their feet up? So the mom can do that with the baby."
485.0,486.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay."
486.0,487.0,Subject,Yeah.
487.0,488.0,Interviewer,Cute.
488.0,513.0,Subject,"That way they can be there, and it doesn't seem like they're disrupting anything."
513.0,518.0,Interviewer,So you've been really excited about hanging out with your goddaughter?
518.0,519.0,Subject,Yeah.
519.0,524.75,Interviewer,Do you feel like she inspired you a little bit to do the prenatal yoga?
524.75,525.0,Subject,Yeah.
525.0,527.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
527.0,538.0,Subject,Yeah.
538.0,548.0,Interviewer,So what else have you enjoyed about being with your goddaughter? Like what have you learned?
548.0,571.75,Subject,"Well, I don't have any kids yet, so it's everything I learn [inaudible] to her. I don't know just everything. I got her a Baby Bullet or whatever. Well, she's not vegan. I want her to be vegan. But my friend-- she actually uses it, and I give her recipes, and we make stuff and try to trick her into eating things."
571.75,572.0,Interviewer,It's a blender?
572.0,593.0,Subject,"Yeah. So we make her like homemade baby food from scratch or whatever. So I like that. And just like all the products and stuff that I know, and my friend let me make her stuff. I made her a bracelet with crystals and stuff, so. It's like I don't have a kid, so it's like she's my baby too in a way. And I like buying her so much clothes. I love clothes."
593.0,595.0,Interviewer,So you treat her almost like she's your own.
595.0,595.75,Subject,Yeah.
595.75,596.0,Interviewer,That's sweet.
596.0,605.75,Subject,"It's like she makes up for it even though my friend's like I need to have a baby. She's always tagging me in photos with two little friends. She's like, ""We're just waiting on you so she could have a best friend."" And I'm like, ""No."""
605.75,606.0,Interviewer,That's funny.
606.0,619.0,Subject,But it's like she's my baby in a way.
619.0,621.0,Interviewer,It feels almost like she's your own baby.
621.0,642.0,Subject,Yeah.
642.0,648.0,Interviewer,So it seems like things have been generally going really well lately? You've had a lot of new and exciting things?
648.0,649.0,Subject,Yeah.
649.0,650.0,Interviewer,Would you say so?
650.0,652.0,Subject,Yeah.
652.0,659.0,Interviewer,How has it been lately compared to how it was before?
659.0,689.0,Subject,"I feel like now I'm just a little more self-focused in a way like just-- I don't know, prioritizing different things. It was kind of hard for me to find time to go to yoga, and now I made time like I did before I came here like in the morning. So it's like just prioritizing my health, I guess and taking it-- yeah, just putting a little more focus on it than I did."
689.0,690.0,Interviewer,You've been prioritizing your health more.
690.0,718.0,Subject,"Yeah. And like my time and stuff, I consider all of those things like dancing and just doing movement, I consider all that like putting myself first. So just taking more me time, I guess. I used to always just work a lot or whatever, and I feel like now, I'm just doing more things that make me happy and stuff."
718.0,721.0,Interviewer,So you used to work more.
721.0,737.0,Subject,"Yeah. Even school, I'm just not nerdy, but I was always on the debate team. I was editor of the school magazine. I was always busy in school and stuff, and I didn't really have as much of a social life as I should have at some certain times, so that's what I mean."
737.0,739.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
739.0,745.0,Subject,"Even though I like all of those things, it's just there are so many other things that I like to do, so."
745.0,750.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you feel like your social life has also been flourishing more lately?
750.0,763.0,Subject,"Yeah because I'm meeting who-- I always say everyone who's like me doesn't live here, so I'm meeting people who like similar things. And it's like well, maybe if I was doing these things, I would've encountered them, so."
763.0,774.0,Interviewer,"Interesting. So do you feel like lately, you have found more people who are doing the things that more people are like you?"
774.0,781.0,Subject,"Yeah especially at the studio where everyone's different, so."
781.0,784.0,Interviewer,"You feel like they're all different kinds of people, but they're also like you?"
784.0,788.0,Subject,"Yeah. We like similar things where I was like, ""Who would have thought?"" Or whatever."
788.0,795.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what kinds of things do you find that you have in common with people?
795.0,864.0,Subject,"Well, a few of them are vegan and vegetarian whatever, and we [inaudible] restaurants. Another girl that I'm really close with even just now on walking here I was on the train, we were doing books and stuff. I love books, so. I'm like, ""[inaudible]"" and we just like exchanging books and stuff. And it's like we don't have a book club, but there's just me and her like reading the same books at the same time, which is really fun. Or she goes to the yoga studio that I told her to go to, or she'll tell me other places that we could go and hang out and stuff like places I didn't know about they knew or vice versa. Like an author I really liked, she came to some crystal shop in the city. And she came with me or whatever, which is nice because usually, I don't care. I will go alone or whatever. So it's nice to have someone that is coming with me and is actually interested in it because usually, I just drag my boyfriend. I kind of feel bad. Even though he doesn't mind coming, but I'm like, ""Oh, we're going to this grand opening at this restaurant."" And he's not vegan, but he eats like it, and he doesn't mind. But it's just like I don't want to feel like I'm just-- he says I'm not dragging him, but I don't want to feel like that all the time. ""It's not really your thing."""
864.0,866.0,Interviewer,"You don't want to feel like you're dragging him to the vegan restaurants, you said."
866.0,902.0,Subject,"I mean because he always-- every time we go out to eat, he's always like, ""Well, you're vegan."" I'm like, ""Okay. It doesn't have to be a vegan restaurant. I can figure something else out."" Or if you call ahead, the shop will do something, so it's not a big deal. But every little thing is like a midnight brunch or, ""I'm going to go this vegan street fair. It's in the summer. And I'm like, 'Well, you're going to that."" So I don't want to make him go to every other thing, or he'll be like, ""Who you going with, your friends or by yourself?"" And I'm like, ""Myself."" He's like, ""Why you didn't invite me?"" Because then I feel like in a way like you're my only friend if that's the case. So it's just nice to have other people who actually like this thing."
902.0,905.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So some of the people at the studio are also vegan?
905.0,911.0,Subject,"Yeah. Or even if they're not, they're just interested in going and just trying different things, so it's just nice."
911.0,915.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do they go to the street fair with you?
915.0,944.0,Subject,"Well, that's new, so my friend said she's going to come this year, one of the girls I met at the studio. But it's new. This is going to be the second year. Last one I went with my friend-- she was pregnant at the time I went with her last year. Yeah. She's not a vegan either, but she's open-- she eats it and stuff occasionally or whatever. She's not that interested, but then she has a baby. So I figure it's too many hours of walking. It's nice."
944.0,951.75,Interviewer,Yeah. Sounds like you have like a lot of good friends.
951.75,952.0,Subject,Yeah.
952.0,955.0,Interviewer,That's nice. Your boyfriend too.
955.0,959.0,Subject,Yeah.
959.0,961.0,Interviewer,How's that?
961.0,968.0,Subject,He's just funny.
968.0,972.0,Interviewer,You sound like you're saying just things have been going really well socially.
972.0,974.0,Subject,Yeah.
974.0,1000.0,Interviewer,And it sounds like you have just good relationships. So what else?
1000.0,1002.0,Subject,I'm going to start the fast tomorrow.
1002.0,1003.0,Interviewer,"Oh, the fast tomorrow."
1003.0,1005.0,Subject,Yeah.
1005.0,1008.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How are you feeling about that?
1008.0,1011.0,Subject,Excited.
1011.0,1012.0,Interviewer,Have you done it many times?
1012.0,1020.0,Subject,"No. Only once-- and it was in Ramadan anyway, but I'm still not going to do it the way that they do it, though. I'm just going to eat only fruits for 30 days."
1020.0,1021.0,Interviewer,You're going to eat what?
1021.0,1024.0,Subject,Only fruits for the entire [inaudible].
1024.0,1025.0,Interviewer,Okay.
1025.0,1042.0,Subject,"I did two weeks last year in January of just liquids, and that was pretty good. But a month is a long time. But I plan to stay committed. So I'm excited though to see the difference."
1042.0,1045.0,Interviewer,You're excited about seeing the difference.
1045.0,1053.0,Subject,"Like mentally if it changes [inaudible] physically. I'm probably going to lose some type of weight, I'm sure. I'm just going to see the difference."
1053.0,1061.0,Interviewer,So you're concerned or excited?
1061.0,1068.0,Subject,"We're excited. I'm not worried. I mean, people are fruitarians, and they're fine."
1068.0,1069.0,Interviewer,"Oh, fruitarians?"
1069.0,1070.0,Subject,Yeah. Where they only eat fruits.
1070.0,1071.0,Interviewer,Interesting.
1071.0,1079.0,Subject,Yeah. So I'm not worried. I'm kind of like a daredevil with some of that anyway. It's only 30 days.
1079.0,1081.0,Interviewer,It sounds like you're doing it partly for fun just to see if you can do it?
1081.0,1091.0,Subject,"I mean, in a way to see how it is, yeah. I like the challenge."
1091.0,1104.0,Interviewer,"So you like the challenge, and you're excited about it, and you think you might lose some weight. What else do you think it's going to be like?"
1104.0,1126.0,Subject,"I'll probably feel better because I feel like lately, I've been eating a lot of veggie burgers, which I normally don't eat processed foods anyway. So I don't know. I'm just excited to see what the change is because I don't really know what the difference will be. So I'm kind of just excited for that."
1126.0,1128.0,Interviewer,And you're doing it-- your boyfriend's also doing it?
1128.0,1145.0,Subject,Yeah. But he's going to eat-- do what they do like what all Muslims do. I guess they don't eat anything after sunrise and before sunset. Not even water. So it's extreme to me.
1145.0,1146.0,Interviewer,It's extreme to you?
1146.0,1147.0,Subject,Yeah.
1147.0,1149.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
1149.0,1160.0,Subject,"Well, to each his own."
1160.0,1164.0,Interviewer,Do you know anyone else who's doing it also with you?
1164.0,1184.0,Subject,"No. No. I don't. I know a few Muslims, but I guess they don't care about it. Well, my uncle's-- I don't know, my uncle is a Muslin, you know? I'm not as close with him. But I could ask him. I wonder if he's doing that. I'm not sure."
1184.0,1201.0,Interviewer,So that's something exciting coming up. Anything else exciting or anything else you've been thinking about that's coming up in the future?
1201.0,1212.0,Subject,Not right now. But I'm thinking about doing my 200 hours of yoga. Not right now though. 200 hours of training. Yeah.
1212.0,1214.0,Interviewer,So you do 200 hours of training?
1214.0,1215.0,Subject,Yeah.
1215.0,1216.0,Interviewer,And what does that do?
1216.0,1218.0,Subject,Yeah. To certify yoga.
1218.0,1219.0,Interviewer,"Oh, instructor."
1219.0,1221.0,Subject,Yeah.
1221.0,1224.0,Interviewer,So you're thinking about becoming a yoga instructor?
1224.0,1231.0,Subject,"Yeah. Not now, though. Like in the near future."
1231.0,1234.0,Interviewer,What makes you want to do that?
1234.0,1261.0,Subject,"I don't know. When I did it, I was like 19. And I don't know, the class was kind of boring to me. But I did like how I felt afterward. So it was the feeling, but now that I have more fast-- I think I like more fast-paced yoga where you're like sweating. I guess they call it cardio yoga. And it was like two years ago, I took this one class, and I loved it. And I said, ""I'm going to do this for the rest of my life,"" so. Yeah."
1261.0,1263.0,Interviewer,"Two years ago, you took a class that you really liked."
1263.0,1267.0,Subject,"Yeah. And I said, ""I'm going to do this for the rest of my life."" I declared it after that class."
1267.0,1268.0,Interviewer,Oh.
1268.0,1274.0,Subject,So I kind of don't want to put things off as just hobbies anymore because I want to take it more serious.
1274.0,1278.0,Interviewer,"So that's one of those things that you realized, ""This is something I want to take seriously."""
1278.0,1305.0,Subject,"Yeah. But even nutrition, I never thought-- I knew I liked it, and I always took classes in college, but I never considered it. And one time, my grandma said, ""I think you should be a nutritionist."" I was like, ""Really?"" Or my little cousins, it feels good if they ask me something. My cousin's like, he's like, ""I'm not feeling well. I think have asthma or whatever. What could I take?"" It makes me feel good when they ask me stuff, or they say the things that I've taught them."
1305.0,1307.0,Interviewer,It makes you feel like you could help them.
1307.0,1317.0,Subject,"Yeah. Or they trust me. That's what I like, the trust."
1317.0,1319.0,Interviewer,It feels nice to feel trusted.
1319.0,1338.0,Subject,"Yeah. People value my opinion. Like my friend, I used to work with her a long time ago, and she would say, ""I have really bad cramps, and I have PMS."" And she's like, ""What could I take or what could I do?"" And it's like the fact that you think to ask me before Google is amazing in this day and age, so."
1338.0,1402.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What else would someone want to know what it's like to be you?
1402.0,1410.0,Subject,I really like cooking. I actually took some-- they have public class-- I don't know if you ever heard of the Natural Gourmet Institute?
1410.0,1411.0,Interviewer,No.
1411.0,1427.0,Subject,"I know they have eggs there, so I guess it's like the only vegan-vegetarian culinary school. It's in the city by 23rd. I took some public classes there. And it was really nice. That one was like vegan's tofu. So they tell you how to make macaroni and cheese from scratch."
1427.0,1428.0,Interviewer,Cool.
1428.0,1435.0,Subject,"Well, I could, but the cheese sauce, I know how to make it from scratch. And pie crust from scratch, biscuits and gravy. It was really nice."
1435.0,1436.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1436.0,1440.0,Subject,"That's another thing I want to do too one day, go to culinary school."
1440.0,1443.0,Interviewer,So you took some courses at this place?
1443.0,1452.0,Subject,"Yeah because they have some open to the public. You don't have to be enrolled in school. And in three hours, it was like, master chef. It was crazy."
1452.0,1454.0,Interviewer,You felt you were a master chef in three hours?
1454.0,1497.0,Subject,"Yeah because you get to make all these-- they have you make all these things in different groups. So it was a lot. We were making all these things in three hours, six items. But halfway through, it's like, ""Okay. We're getting it."" And it was really nice. I guess I've been doing more things that I like, more social things. I like going out more. I'm not a party person. So I just I don't know, I just go to stuff like that, cooking classes or if an author I like is coming to town or concerts where I can sit down because I hate standing up."
1497.0,1500.75,Interviewer,So you've been going to concerts where you can sit down [crosstalk].
1500.75,1501.0,Subject,"Well, they just closed BB King's."
1501.0,1502.0,Interviewer,Lazy concerts.
1502.0,1504.0,Subject,They just closed it. I'm so devastated.
1504.0,1505.0,Interviewer,What did they close?
1505.0,1516.0,Subject,BB King's. I always go there. I can see my favorite singers growing up for like $40 and stuff. And I can sit down because I get there early and wait in line. But if they--
1516.0,1517.0,Interviewer,And they closed it?
1517.0,1528.0,Subject,"They closed it like two weeks ago. So I'm devastated because I know I can sit down for sure. I don't know, I hate standing up. I want the choice to stand up when I want. I want to sit down."
1528.0,1531.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Seems reasonable.
1531.0,1537.0,Subject,Yeah.
1537.0,1540.0,Interviewer,So now you don't have a place to go for concerts anymore?
1540.0,1541.0,Subject,I can find somewhere else.
1541.0,1544.0,Interviewer,Why did they close it?
1544.0,1554.0,Subject,"Their rent was really high. They've been open for over 20-something years, it's crazy. The rent is really high because they're right on 42nd, Times Square."
1554.0,1559.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1559.0,1581.0,Subject,"I don't know, my life is like boring because it's like I'm a fixed sign, and I do the same-- I like routine. So I need to do the same thing to feel organized and clear-headed. I'm not a spontaneous person. I need to know that, ""Okay. Wednesday, I go and yoga. Thursday, I'm doing this."" So."
1581.0,1582.0,Interviewer,So you like to have structure.
1582.0,1584.0,Subject,Yeah.
1584.0,1593.0,Interviewer,What does your usual structure look like?
1593.0,1628.0,Subject,"It just depends on the amount of time or whatever. I've been trying to put in working out, but I need t get up because I work late now like 5:00 to 9:30 at the studio or whatever. This is different because I'm usually a morning person. I am a morning person. But now I have more free time. So I just get up, and I just make breakfast or whatever. And by the time I go to the gym or I go to yoga and just take care of whatever stuff that I have to do during the day. I read a lot, help my grandma."
1628.0,1629.0,Interviewer,You help your grandma?
1629.0,1630.0,Subject,Yeah.
1630.0,1632.0,Interviewer,What do you help her with?
1632.0,1653.75,Subject,"She doesn't like cooking anymore, so I usually cook, or she's only motivated to cook if I help her. So I go, ""I'm going to make something or whatever."" I think she feels bad because her kids are grown, so she doesn't have anyone to cook for. So like that or just whatever like laundry. I'm-- I don't know, I'm like an expert when it comes to laundry. I'm obsessed with laundry."
1653.75,1654.0,Interviewer,Really?
1654.0,1657.0,Subject,I'm just so particular with the laundry.
1657.0,1658.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
1658.0,1659.0,Subject,So I usually do--
1659.0,1661.0,Interviewer,You're very particular with how you do it?
1661.0,1676.0,Subject,"Yeah. It just I don't know. But my clothes-- usually when I wash them, they will smell good for days. I'm just really particular though. I love doing laundry. It's my favorite chore. So I usually do that for her."
1676.0,1678.0,Interviewer,What do you like about it?
1678.0,1681.75,Subject,"Well, I love clean clothes. I don't know who doesn't love clean clothes."
1681.75,1682.0,Interviewer,I don't either.
1682.0,1700.0,Subject,"I don't know, I'm just-- it's like a habit to a science or something. You know what it is? My mom used to take me with her and I used to help her fold clothes. But she never told me how to do laundry. So when I went to college, I didn't know how to do laundry. And someone showed me, and I wasn't happy. And then I read a book on it. I was on YouTube looking at videos, and then now I'm just like--"
1700.0,1701.0,Interviewer,You made yourself an expert.
1701.0,1702.0,Subject,Yeah. I just love doing laundry.
1702.0,1703.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1703.0,1707.0,Subject,"And then I work out too, so I'm like fitness clothes need special attention, so."
1707.0,1709.0,Interviewer,Yeah. They got to get washed a lot.
1709.0,1715.0,Subject,Yeah. I'm just really particular when washing clothes.
1715.0,1717.0,Interviewer,And so they smell good for a long time when you wash them?
1717.0,1737.0,Subject,"Yeah. No. When I bring them in, like my mom is a really good cleaner, but I'm like, ""I'm a better-- ask grandma. Grandma, who's a better washer?"" And she's like-- I'm like, ""Tell the truth. Mommy's not going to feel offended."" She's like, ""You,"" because it just smells so good. The smell just lingers. The whole house smells like laundry. It just smells so good."
1737.0,1740.0,Interviewer,How do you get them to smell so good? Put extra--
1740.0,1762.0,Subject,"I put baking soda, Downey Scent Boosters. I guess it's the amount of soap that I use, or I don't know, I like aromatherapy, so I'm picky with scents and what goes together. So I won't use a certain fabric softener with something else. Once in a while, I make my own soap when I feel like it."
1762.0,1764.0,Interviewer,You're a connoisseur of the smells.
1764.0,1769.0,Subject,Yeah [laughter].
1769.0,1775.0,Interviewer,"Some people like to be picky and be a connoisseur of wine, but you like to do it with the smells of laundry."
1775.0,1781.0,Subject,Yeah [laughter]. I don't drink wine. Yeah.
1781.0,1795.0,Interviewer,"It's fun. All right. Well, that's good. I think we can go ahead and stop there. But before we stop, Shayna, is there anything else that I didn't think to ask you that you wanted to talk about?"
1795.0,1801.0,Subject,Not really.
