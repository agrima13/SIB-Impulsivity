2.0,19.0,Interviewer,"Recording is going. Thanks again for coming. And like I said, the point of this part is just sort of to get to know a little bit more about you, understand what it's like to be you. So how have things been going lately?"
19.0,39.0,Subject,"Not bad. With school, I'm just kind of out of it, I'm out of the zone. Since spring break being in a month, I haven't even opened my book. I'm trying, I'm just saying, ""Ugh, I can't."" So I'm just literally thinking about traveling. I'm planning my next [laughter] trip. It's kind of bad, but [laughter] that's what's been going on."
39.0,40.0,Interviewer,So you're done with school?
40.0,49.0,Subject,"Yeah. I can't be, though, but at the same time, my brain is not mentally there. Yeah [laughter]."
49.0,52.0,Interviewer,So you're looking forward to it being over. Is it over at the end of the--?
52.0,72.0,Subject,"Yes, over at the end of this semester. I think I just need a new environment. Maybe that's why I come, I'm just kind of over going to Hunter and-- same thing, undergrad classes. I just want to move on, be in another program. Maybe a much smaller school where there's more attention. Maybe a different environment, not New York City, but yeah."
72.0,74.0,Interviewer,"[inaudible] survey, you want a new environment."
74.0,94.0,Subject,"Yeah, because when I went away, I was actually so interested in seeing everything I could barely sleep. I was excited, but when I came back home, I was just sleeping. I was just done. I was physically and mentally tired [laughter]. Yeah. I think just new environment. I need a change in environment, change of scenery."
94.0,97.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So how was it when you went there before? Because, say--"
97.0,129.0,Subject,"Amazing. I had so much fun. I literally did everything I planned to do. It was just different. Yeah, I went to San Francisco. It was different, just stuff I did. There's so much to see there. I've been in New York City all my life. I'm not interested in seeing The Statue of Liberty [laughter] like people at my job. People ask me all the time since I work right by it, they're like, ""Oh, so how do you get there?"" I'm like, ""I think you take the ferry."" They're like, ""Have you seen it?"" I'm like, ""No [laughter]."" Yeah."
129.0,131.0,Interviewer,So you saw a lot of interesting new stuff in San Francisco?
131.0,134.75,Subject,Yeah. I went to Yosemite National Park and it was amazing.
134.75,135.0,Interviewer,Wow.
135.0,145.0,Subject,"Yeah. I didn't want to leave. It was amazing. The air was fresh, everything was just wow. Yeah, it was breathtaking. Yeah."
145.0,146.0,Interviewer,I imagine.
146.0,148.0,Subject,Yeah. It was nice.
148.0,151.0,Interviewer,What was it like there? So fresh air?
151.0,155.0,Subject,"Fresh air, no buses [laughter]. No dirty rats [laughter] or anything."
155.0,156.0,Interviewer,No piles of garbage?
156.0,162.0,Subject,"Exactly. San Francisco in the city, people were kind of a little bit crazy over there."
162.0,163.0,Interviewer,"Oh, really?"
163.0,198.0,Subject,"Yeah, so you can see it's the same thing, homeless people, but the homeless people over there are kind of, I don't know, on drugs. Because they talk to each other. They talk out loud. Yeah. It's the same thing as Los Angeles. I didn't expect that, but it's concentrated in a certain area. So other parts are nice and then you'll see the down parts, which are not so good. But yeah, they're kind of crazier over there [laughter]. I don't know why. I don't know why. It's something in the air, but other than that, it was really nice."
198.0,201.0,Interviewer,So LA also?
201.0,202.0,Subject,"Yeah, I went to LA in August."
202.0,203.0,Interviewer,"Oh, okay. Separate trips."
203.0,230.0,Subject,"I didn't do it-- yeah, separate trips, but same crazy. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it was kind of weird because I didn't expect-- we went to see Beverly Hills. I didn't expect to see a guy just lying on the sign. Yeah. So it was like, ""Oh, okay."" Venice Beach is not as pretty as [laughter] they show it on TV. It's a lot of crazy and people living in tents. Yeah."
230.0,231.0,Interviewer,Wow. So not exactly what you expected.
231.0,237.0,Subject,"Yeah, but it was still kind of okay. I liked San Francisco better, though. Definitely better."
237.0,238.0,Interviewer,What did you like better about San Francisco?
238.0,256.75,Subject,"Maybe because I got to do everything. LA was kind of like I wasn't focusing on what to do so I was buying makeup, hair. Remember when I told you I spent two grand? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So I was just focusing on the wrong things. I remember overpacking, paying for that. It was just a mess. Missing my flight [laughter]."
256.75,257.0,Interviewer,"Oh, really?"
257.0,305.0,Subject,"Yeah. I planned it because it was I think 10 of us that went. So I like to plan things and like to be organized, so I was helping everybody out. So they're like, ""Oh, what are we doing with flights?"" I'm like, ""Okay, I'll check it for you guys."" So I was pretty much checking flights for me and my sisters and our friends, so six of us who were leaving from New York City. My cousin, who was leaving from West Palm Beach, and then two other friends leaving from Orlando. And then another friend leaving from Buffalo. So I was literally checking flights for everybody. And then the flights I found for us were perfect because I think I told you before I want to visit the 50 states. So there was going to be a layover in Vegas for eight hours. Ended up missing that and then they put us on a non-stop flight. So I was kind of upset with that."
305.0,306.0,Interviewer,Oh no.
306.0,307.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah.
307.0,310.0,Interviewer,It's one of your 50 state check buckets.
310.0,318.0,Subject,"Exactly [laughter]. So I have to plan that out sometime. So the whole trip was just a mess. We weren't organized, we were all over the place."
318.0,319.0,Interviewer,Really? So the whole thing was kind of like that?
319.0,327.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah [laughter]. We didn't even see much. And we were literally Googling stuff there. And I'm just like, ""I can't do this."""
327.0,328.0,Interviewer,Was it stressful by the end?
328.0,335.0,Subject,"Yeah, it was stressful. I'm just like, ""Yeah, I don't think I'm going to be traveling with as much people like that."" Yeah."
335.0,338.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Especially when they want you to be in charge, huh?"
338.0,464.0,Subject,"Yeah, not even want me to be in charge, but they just, ""Oh yeah, whatever. We can do whatever."" And then you have some people complaining, like our family friend. She was kind of the reason we were late. So she was literally five minutes away. So the whole entire time we were planning the trip she's like, ""Okay, I'm going to come to your house, sleep over,"" because we wanted to share-- so we had our own personal carry-on and then we wanted to share a check-in. So she was like, ""Yeah, let's do that. Let's do that. So I'm going to come down the night before. I'll pack my stuff."" She came an hour before our flight. That's why we missed that flight. So she's throwing stuff in. And then we get there, our suitcase was overweight so I didn't know what was going on when they were packing. I already put my stuff to the side. So I'm like, ""Why is it overweight? Let's rearrange."" She's like, ""No, it's okay. I'll pay."" And I'm like, ""Okay."" So we finally get to LA the next day and then come to find out it was her makeup bag [laughter]. 30 pounds. She brought a huge makeup bag and put everything in it. So it was just ridiculous. I'm like, ""You know what?"" And it went downhill from there. My second sister, so the middle one-- they're close and they're the same age. So they were going back and forth fighting. Yeah, it was a mess. She was complaining. We rented a car and then the last two days we were planning on doing stuff. And that Sunday we were planning on going out to eat and all coordinating outfits. That didn't end up happening because she was like, ""Oh, I never got an outfit,"" but she was the one that told us, ""Let's get a red outfit."" And I suggested black because everybody has black, but she was like, ""Red."" And then like, ""Oh, I don't have that outfit."" I'm like, ""Okay."" So we didn't end up doing that. So we saw Jack In The Box-- either Jack In The Box or something-- just to eat. Okay, let's just go eat. So she's like, ""No, I want Subway [laughter]."" I'm like, ""Are you serious? You eat Subway every day."" She's like, ""Yeah, well, what I'm going to try out is on the West Coast."" I'm like, ""It's not going to be any different."" Just complaining from her end and then it just-- yeah. It was too much. Too much going on. So this trip was better because it was me and my younger sister. Because my middle sister, she's away at school. So me and her, and then a college friend. Three of us and that was it."
464.0,465.0,Interviewer,"Ah, that was better."
465.0,480.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, so much better. So much better [laughter]. So I'm going to start traveling like that now. Just doing my own thing. My sister likes traveling with me, so it was just me and her. And when my other sister has time she'll do it, too."
480.0,481.0,Interviewer,"So that was kind of a good learning experience, then, huh?"
481.0,482.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely."
482.0,485.0,Interviewer,Just between six or seven to three.
485.0,491.75,Subject,"Definitely, yeah [laughter]. It was even nine of us there. Nine and eleven there was, all together, trying to figure out--"
491.75,492.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
492.0,493.0,Subject,Yeah. It was crazy.
493.0,496.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, well."
496.0,497.0,Subject,"But, yeah. Right now--"
497.0,498.0,Interviewer,Were they fun overall?
498.0,503.0,Subject,"Yeah, fun overall [laughter]."
503.0,504.0,Interviewer,"Sorry, I cut you off."
504.0,523.0,Subject,"Oh, no. That's fine. But yeah, right now I'm trying to kind of get back into finishing up with school because I have a paper due next week, an exam. So I need to kind of just make myself do it. Yeah."
523.0,526.0,Interviewer,You feel like it's hard to get yourself into the zone for this?
526.0,533.0,Subject,"Exactly. I have one month left so it shouldn't be bad, but at the same time I'm just dreading it [laughter]. Yeah."
533.0,535.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I guess that's close to the end of the semester."
535.0,538.0,Subject,Yeah.
538.0,540.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. What are you dreading about it, do you think?"
540.0,563.0,Subject,"Just the work [laughter]. It just sounds so much, just the work in general. I know it's only a short time, but it's just like my mind is not there anymore. Yeah, that's what I'm dreading about it. But I know, okay, this is it. I need to just put everything aside and just focus on the score. Yeah."
563.0,567.0,Interviewer,I know you love traveling. Do you have any other plans coming up?
567.0,672.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah [laughter]. So June in Miami because my sister is going to be home and she didn't actually get to go on Spring Break, her own. I told her maybe she should plan something, I'll help her, but she didn't end up figuring out because she's not working. So she didn't really have enough money. So June I planned Miami. Just three of us. I asked a friend to join, but she's not sure yet because her work schedule. She told me she'll get back to me. So right now it's three of us going in June. July, my other friend who wanted to join us in San Francisco, but she's kind of a later person. So when she told me I was like-- we had already kind of booked it. So then she said, ""Oh, why don't we do something Columbus week?"" And I'm like, ""That's kind of far."" So I ended up saying, ""We can go on a road trip to Myrtle Beach in July."" So, yeah. And that's going to cross off three new states because I've been to Delaware. What was it? Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. So that's in July. And then New Orleans in August. Yeah, there. We're spending a week there and then-- I didn't want to stay in New Orleans for the whole week because I think it's just Bourbon Street [laughter]. Pretty much just Bourbon Street, that's all I heard. Bourbon Street and then maybe a few tours, but I don't want to spend the week there. So then I didn't know Greyhound is so cheap out-of-state, down south, Midwest. You can actually take a Greyhound and it'll be like $15. I just found that out. So from New Orleans, maybe the last couple of days we're there, we'll go to-- where is it-- Mississippi and Alabama. And it's literally, I don't know, $15 one way. That's not bad. So three more states [laughter]."
672.0,673.75,Interviewer,"Three more states. That's six total, right?"
673.75,674.0,Subject,Yes.
674.0,685.0,Interviewer,"[inaudible]? Yeah, wow. That's really great. Have you always had the goal of doing all 50 states?"
685.0,744.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think I've had this goal since high school, but my mom was kind of strict back then. And she was always like, ""No, you have to stay in school. You have to study. This and that, blah, blah, blah."" But I'm getting older, so I want to experience life. I just don't want to be like, ""Okay, I went to school."" I want to do more than just reading my books [laughter]. So yeah, definitely has been a goal of mine for a long time because-- I think it came from being into geography and social studies. That was my favorite subjects in elementary school and middle school. So I love learning about that, interesting facts and stuff like that. And I'm good with numbers so I have-- I'm going to say that I'm good with memorizing numbers in stuff like historical facts. I kind of remember a date of something. If I've seen it a couple of times, I would memorize the date, exactly the year. So I like numbers, I like traveling, I like knowing things outside of just New York City. Yeah, so the geography. Yeah."
744.0,747.0,Interviewer,So part of it is a quest to learn a bunch of stuff?
747.0,748.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah."
748.0,753.0,Interviewer,That's cool. Just different kind of stuff than you learned in school. That's a different kind of learning.
753.0,763.0,Subject,"Exactly, yeah. So, yeah. That's the deal with the all 50 states. Yeah, my mom thought I was joking and I'm like, ""No, I want to really do it."" I'm not in a rush, but I just want to do it [laughter]."
763.0,764.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's a cool goal.
764.0,803.0,Subject,"Yeah. And then planning next year to do international traveling. Or maybe this year, but I'm going to see how it goes because I want to go to Nigeria. Me and my sisters haven't been there in 20 years. Almost 20 years now. And my mom'd say, ""You guys have to go back."" And I'm like, ""Okay, but it's a lot of money [laughter]."" So we're trying to see how that is going to go. Yeah. So in December, hopefully, we can buy tickets for like $900, because right now I'm seeing $1300. I'm like, ""That's a lot."" Yeah, yeah."
803.0,804.0,Interviewer,So you're thinking about going back to Nigeria?
804.0,833.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely want to go back. Sold a bunch of clothes. See the rest of my family and, yeah, just experience that side of the world again. Yeah, because it's different. I went when I was eight, I believe. I'm 27 now. So it's like things have changed. I haven't seen my grandma in a while. My uncles, and aunts, and cousins, I haven't seen in a while. Yeah. That's different."
833.0,834.0,Interviewer,Do you keep in touch with them?
834.0,845.0,Subject,"My parents do. So my parents talk to them. And then once in a while I'll speak to my grandmother and stuff like that. When it's her birthday we'll call her and we'll shout, ""Happy Birthday."" Yeah."
845.0,847.0,Interviewer,What do you think it'll be like when you go back?
847.0,870.75,Subject,"I think they'll be surprised to see how big we are [laughter]. Yeah, but I think it'll be the same. Yeah. They'll be surprised to see how big we are. And since we're older now, I think we can experience more. We can actually travel around and go to different cities as opposed to when we went with our parents and we went everywhere they went."
870.75,871.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
871.0,872.0,Subject,Yeah.
872.0,873.0,Interviewer,You can plan your own trip.
873.0,880.75,Subject,"Exactly, yeah. So hopefully we go back, but I don't know."
880.75,881.0,Interviewer,A lot of money.
881.0,894.0,Subject,"Yeah. We did renew our passports last year. I don't know why, but we [laughter]-- yeah, we did. So hopefully we can use it because it expires every five years as opposed to the American passport, which is 10 years."
894.0,895.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you have Nigerian passports?"
895.0,905.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, and what I did learn is that with our Nigerian passports we don't have to actually get a visa is we want to travel to a North African country. So we can use that, yeah."
905.0,910.0,Interviewer,"Oh, nice. Yeah, that could be easy to make a big trip with that."
910.0,916.0,Subject,"Exactly, yeah. So I'm looking forward to that if we do go."
916.0,918.0,Interviewer,You're looking forward to checking out a few different places?
918.0,924.0,Subject,"Yeah, exactly. Not only Nigeria but a few other places also."
924.0,926.0,Interviewer,Anything in mind that you'd like to do there?
926.0,927.0,Subject,In Nigeria or--?
927.0,930.0,Interviewer,Anywhere in Africa on that trip.
930.0,945.75,Subject,"Ghana, since it's kind of close. There's Kakum National Forest. I think that's what it's called. And there's a nice mini-bridge. You know those bridges you see in the movies that are so scary?"
945.75,946.0,Interviewer,A footbridge?
946.0,969.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I want to cross that [laughter]. It looks cool in pictures. Let me see. I want to plan it where there's a nice layover in maybe Cairo or something. Do the pyramids. Or east Africa. Somewhere there. Kenya. Something. Yeah, I want to plan a nice trip. Yeah."
969.0,970.0,Interviewer,Sounds really exciting.
970.0,975.0,Subject,Yeah [laughter]. See? This is why I'm not focusing on school [laughter]. I'm just thinking about traveling.
975.0,976.0,Interviewer,"Oh, I see."
976.0,1022.0,Subject,"Yeah [laughter]. It's so bad. Yeah, no, I'm working. I used to work before but, I didn't see that and go. I used to just use my money for shopping [laughter], but now I see, okay, let me save my money. Let me use it towards actually experiencing life instead of just buying clothes and going to the club. But yeah, now I'm doing that. I'm older. My mom can't really say anything even though she's like, ""Oh, you got all this traveling."" She'll be like, ""Oh, you know what? That's okay, that's what people do at your age."" She doesn't really say it much. And my dad doesn't really care so it's more like my mom. So now I get that freedom to do it and I have the funds to do it. And I just feel like going [laughter]."
1022.0,1027.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you had a change from wanting to spend your money on other stuff to wanting to spend it on travel.
1027.0,1038.0,Subject,"Yeah, exactly, actually. Okay, saving and not shopping as often as I was shopping before."
1038.0,1040.0,Interviewer,What do you think caused that change in your priorities?
1040.0,1050.0,Subject,"Just getting older and seeing all the cool stuff that other people on Instagram and my friends do. I'm like, ""Oh, okay [laughter]."""
1050.0,1051.0,Interviewer,Definitely.
1051.0,1078.0,Subject,"That's what it was. And just getting tired of just staying in New York City, seeing the same things. I love New York City, but at the same time, I just like to step out for a while and not see crowds, buildings, taxis honking horns. Just loud stuff. It's good just to experience something else. And that's how I feel.."
1078.0,1082.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, seems like something like Yosemite is the exact opposite."
1082.0,1085.75,Subject,"Yeah, exactly. Exact opposite. The animals are friendly [laughter]."
1085.75,1086.0,Interviewer,Really?
1086.0,1109.0,Subject,"Yeah. My mom was laughing when I told her. I'm like, ""They were different."" Like the squirrel-- a guy was taking pictures and I don't know if it posed for the guy [laughter], but it was literally standing there still for a good 10 minutes. I was like, ""Wow, interesting."" Interesting, yeah. There was a raven there, also, and it was the same thing. They just stayed still. They didn't move away when we came closer. It was--"
1109.0,1110.0,Interviewer,Sounds great.
1110.0,1114.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah [laughter].
1114.0,1118.0,Interviewer,What else was different there? What was it like?
1118.0,1158.0,Subject,"I don't know. I think there's so much to see and do. I'm not going to say-- the people were kind of friendly, yeah. The people were kind of-- if we had the map, they're like, ""Oh."" They would stop by and, ""Oh, where are you guys looking to go?"" And they would help us. People were friendly. Our Lyft drivers were giving us things to do and see. They were nicer. I don't know. I think it's the hustle and bustle. People are always moving forward here. But yeah, people were friendly. Our Airbnb host was really nice. Yeah, that was another thing. He was super nice. That was my second time being in an Airbnb and I gave him a great review, but he was really nice. His place was clean and stuff. I really liked that."
1158.0,1159.0,Interviewer,Nice.
1159.0,1178.0,Subject,Yeah. Thinking of something else?
1178.0,1185.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I'm wondering what else to ask about, to understand what it's like being you."
1185.0,1262.75,Subject,"I don't know [laughter]. I like to do stuff. Maybe that's what it is, I just like to do stuff. I just don't like to sit. My friend, the one I travel with, she told me she likes travel with me better than with her other friends because they would travel and then sit in the hotel room and watch movies all day, but I would actually like to out and walk and just do stuff. So, yeah, I'm kind of an adventure seeker. I won't say thrill seeker because I don't know how to swim [laughter]. I do want to learn, but-- I won't say I'm going to do something like climb a mountain or-- let me see. Something else. Snorkeling I want to do, but I don't know how to swim. But yeah, I won't say thrill seeker. I won't go somewhere and be like, ""Okay, let me learn how to surf,"" because I'm still scared of swimming and floating in water. I want to learn, but I'm just kind of scared of that. But I do like to go out and do things, experience things, meet new people, try new foods. Yeah."
1262.75,1263.0,Interviewer,An adventure seeker?
1263.0,1264.75,Subject,"Yeah, an adventure seeker."
1264.75,1265.0,Interviewer,Not necessarily a thrill seeker.
1265.0,1271.0,Subject,"Thrill seeker, yeah. Yeah."
1271.0,1274.0,Interviewer,So what are some of your favorite adventures that you've had?
1274.0,1364.0,Subject,"Hmm. Since I just started, kind of, I'm going to say hiking on Yosemite. The bus driver dropped us off in a certain area and they were like, ""You guys have three hours for yourself,"" after they showed us everything else. So I was like, ""Where should we go?"" And then there was something called Vernal Falls. And it was about a 1.7-mile hike. So I was like, ""Okay, let's do it [laughter]."" So I did it. My friend stopped and [laughter] I didn't see her for an hour and a half because she was just out of breath. She was like, ""I can't do this. I'm going to sit here for a little bit and continue."" So I waited for her twice and I didn't see here. I was like, ""No, you know what? I'm going to continue to do this."" I went all the way up by myself, but it was cool. At times I got scared because it's no real-- you're on rock, slippery rocks. The falls are coming so you're getting wet everywhere. Good thing I was wearing sneakers, but it was cool. Yeah. There was other people on the trail but I was by myself, essentially, because my friend was all the way in the back. I continued going until I made it to the top. Yeah. It was steep, too. The steps were steep so--. I was like, ""You know what? No, I'm going to do this."" There was little kids there so I was like, ""If they can do it, I can do it [laughter]."" So it's like that's what pushed me into [laughter]-- yeah."
1364.0,1365.0,Interviewer,You didn't want to be shown up by the little kids?
1365.0,1368.0,Subject,Exactly [laughter]. Exactly.
1368.0,1372.0,Interviewer,"Wow. It sounds like a really good accomplishment there, doing that."
1372.0,1383.0,Subject,"Yeah. If you're free, you and your girlfriend should just go and visit there. And Yosemite, I booked a tour. Definitely worth it, yeah."
1383.0,1385.0,Interviewer,What was the mountain called? Mount Vernon? No?
1385.0,1397.0,Subject,"Vernal Falls. They have different waterfalls. The one they dropped us off at was Yosemite Falls. I'm like, ""That's right there. It's walking distance. I want to try something different."""
1397.0,1398.0,Interviewer,An adventure?
1398.0,1409.0,Subject,"Yeah. So we went to Vernal Falls, yeah. I went to see the trees, but they were closed because they're restoring it. You know the big Sequoia trees that are so--? Yeah, I was disappointed."
1409.0,1410.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1410.0,1410.75,Subject,Yeah.
1410.75,1411.0,Interviewer,That's sad.
1411.0,1436.0,Subject,"Yeah. That was one of the main reasons I booked the tour. I'm like, ""Are the trees open?"" And they were like, ""No, they're restoring it because it's kind of dying."" Because, they explained to us, the roots are small, so when they had people-- it's a major tourist site, so when they had people around it, they would step on it, hug it. So it's kind of destroying it from the bottom and it could fall one day. So they don't want that to happen."
1436.0,1437.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1437.0,1449.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's nice. Well, yeah, I definitely want to do and seek more adventures. Just travel--"

1450.0,1457.0,Subject,"--because I don't know what to do here anymore [laughter]. Just try different restaurants and eat, but that's about it."
1457.0,1458.0,Interviewer,Yeah. There's no mountains to climb around here.
1458.0,1466.0,Subject,Exactly [laughter]. There isn't at all.
1466.0,1468.0,Interviewer,So Yosemite is one of your favorite adventures so far?
1468.0,1511.0,Subject,"Yeah. There is definitely more I'm going to do, but yeah, definitely Yosemite. Let me see. In Miami-- what are we going to do? We want to rent jet skis. We haven't done it yet, but I'm definitely going to rent a Jet Ski. I hope they give us-- what's this thing called?-- safety jacket [laughter], but I'm definitely going to do that. And then also Everglades. Yeah. I saw something online that was they pick you up from Miami because-- we got an Airbnb on South Beach, so pick us up from wherever we're staying and then take us to there. And it'll be a total of five hours. So we want to do that. It's like $30 to book it. So, yeah."
1511.0,1513.75,Interviewer,"What is it going to be like, do you think?"
1513.75,1514.0,Subject,Hot.
1514.0,1515.0,Interviewer,The Everglades?
1515.0,1520.75,Subject,Hot. And they're going to let us pet a baby alligator. So that should be cool [laughter].
1520.75,1521.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1521.0,1560.0,Subject,"Yeah, that should be cool. It's definitely going to be hot. I'm going to need to pack mosquito repellant. That's it, but I'm looking forward to that. I'm just looking forward to doing different things, pretty much. Yeah. The road trip, I'm looking forward to that. I don't mind driving long distance, just as long as you stop here and there and just step out of the car. So I'm definitely going to do that. New Orleans, I don't know what to do yet except, really, go to Cafe Du Monde and eat the beignets [laughter]. That's the only thing I've heard about. And then ghost tour. That's about it. Yeah."
1560.0,1561.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that sounds good."
1561.0,1562.0,Subject,Yeah. Have you been to New Orleans?
1562.0,1563.75,Interviewer,Yeah.
1563.75,1564.0,Subject,How was it?
1564.0,1571.75,Interviewer,"We didn't do any of those things. I need to go back, though, definitely. I think there's a lot I-- I think there is a lot to do."
1571.75,1572.0,Subject,There is.
1572.0,1578.0,Interviewer,I knew you should stay away from Bourbon Street [laughter]. I would just look at it.
1578.0,1597.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's funny. It was funny, last night I was watching Sunday's episode of The Simpsons and they went to New Orleans. Homer literally ate everything. He was like, ""I didn't know there was this great city,"" and just listing all the foods he was eating. And it was so funny. I'm like, ""Oh, my gosh, I could eat this [laughter]."""
1597.0,1600.75,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. I think that's one of the best things to do it--

1604.0,1606.0,Subject,"Yeah, I'm looking forward to that."
1606.0,1610.0,Interviewer,Are you a foodie kind of person?
1610.0,1628.0,Subject,"Yeah. I've been on Yelp, but I started being more serious. So when I was out in San Francisco, I would check in. I would take pictures of the food and then I would write reviews, yeah."
1628.0,1630.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] the foods that you reviewed? Do you remember?
1630.0,1716.0,Subject,"My favorite was this place called The Baked Bear because me and my sister love ice cream. So I Googled the top ice cream places. And it's like an ice cream sandwich. So you can either do cookie and brownie, cookie and cookie, or donuts. And they put the ice cream in the middle and they put toppings. It was so good. And it's a family-owned business. So we went to the first location and the people working were two young guys, I'm going to say 20s. Well, they were really cool. And then they started playing Nigerian music. [inaudible] [laughter]. I'm like, ""Where you guys from?"" And they were from Cypress. They go, ""Yeah, we love Nigerian music."" So they were dancing. So funny. And then the last day we were there we went to the other location. And the woman, I looked at her and I was like-- she looked Greek. So I'm like, ""Oh, where are you from?"" She was Greek. So I was like, ""Oh, nice. Do you know the guys at the other location?"" She's like, ""Yeah."" Those are her nephews. I was like, ""Oh, okay."" We started talking to her and she's actually the co-owner. So she was telling us, first year she opened up the business it was not booming and it was kind of slow. So she was nervous because they put all their family savings into that. So she's like, ""Yeah, and after that things started picking up."" And she was talking to us. She was so grateful. I'm like, ""Oh my God, this is amazing, we love this ice cream, blah, blah, blah."" And she gave me a business card. I'm like, ""If you're ever opening up in the East Coast or New York, let me know because I'm going to come in [laughter]."""
1716.0,1717.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
1717.0,1726.75,Subject,"And she gave us cookies to go because we had our suitcase. And she's like, ""Yeah, I'm a mom first,"" so she's like, ""Here, this is for the trip."" I'm like, ""Oh my gosh, you're so sweet."" But yeah, it's really nice."
1726.75,1727.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1727.0,1728.0,Subject,Yeah.
1728.0,1729.0,Interviewer,"Amazing experience, that sounds like."
1729.0,1762.75,Subject,"Yeah, it was. I loved San Francisco [laughter]. Yeah, it was nice. Let me see, we went to this place called Mr. Holmes Bakehouse. So they're really famous for their cruffins, but we didn't get to try it because we didn't know-- they open at 9:00 but the line starts forming at 8:00. So we got there, they were all sold out. Yeah. We got there, I'm going to say, 10:00. They were sold out. I'm like, ""Oh, okay [laughter]."""
1762.75,1763.0,Interviewer,Wow.
1763.0,1815.0,Subject,"Yeah. It was something [laughter]. So we tried something else, but I still gave them a good review. What else? House of Thai, yeah. It was decent Thai food. Oh, we went to this place called Brenda's Meat and Three. So you could pick a meat and then three sides. So I ended up getting fried chicken, the mac and cheese, fried okra, and jambalaya. It was a decent portion. I gave them a good review. The fried okra was a little bit on the oily side, so I said that, too. And I said I could have tried-- I've tried better mac and cheese, but, yeah. All in all, service was great. But yeah, we did eat a lot [laughter] of different things. I took pictures of a bunch of stuff."
1815.0,1820.0,Interviewer,What about The Mission? Did you go to The Mission?
1820.0,1822.0,Subject,The Mission Delores Park?
1822.0,1825.0,Interviewer,I can't remember. I thought there's an area called The Mission.
1825.0,1826.0,Subject,Yeah.
1826.0,1828.75,Interviewer,I think there was really good Mexican food there.

1838.0,1839.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, maybe."
1839.0,1878.0,Subject,"Something like that. Mission Delores Park. Yeah, we didn't stay in Mission Delores Park. We went to the Full House house, the Painted Ladies. I was kind of disappointed because I thought they were going to be really bright. I don't know, because those Painted Ladies, I thought it was going to be something like you can see that's so different from the rest of their houses, but I was like, ""Wait. Is that the Painted Ladies?"" And they're like, ""Yeah."" And it was really sunny that day, so it just kind of looked like yellow, red, regular paints. I was like, ""What's so special about them?"" It was weird. I was like, ""What's so special about them?"" And Snapchat had the filter with the houses. I'm like, ""Okay, I don't get it [laughter]."""
1878.0,1879.0,Interviewer,That's funny.
1879.0,1883.75,Subject,"Yeah. We went to Napa and Sonoma Valley on Sunday. So that was nice, too, yeah."
1883.75,1884.0,Interviewer,Both of them?
1884.0,1894.0,Subject,"Yeah, because the tour took us to both. And it was really nice, yeah. And they pretty much recovered from the fires, yeah, so everything was good. Yeah."
1894.0,1896.0,Interviewer,Did you get to drink a lot of good wine?
1896.0,1923.0,Subject,"Oh, my gosh, yeah. The first stop, the first winery was really great. And then the second was good, too. And we bought a wine bottle from there. And the third was a bunch of reds and I prefer a white wine, so I didn't really like it, but he gave us like six, seven different wines. I'm like, ""Yeah, it's kind of too bitter for me [laughter]."" Yeah, yeah, it was nice. It was a nice tour, yeah. The weather was great."

1925.0,1931.0,Interviewer,"Weather coming around there. Was it good for Yosemite, too? I hope."
1931.0,1945.0,Subject,"Yes, and it was so funny because Yosemite-- the day after. So we went on the Thursday. The day after, that's when it was raining really hard in San Francisco. It also rained there so it closed down the park. Yeah, so we went on the perfect day."
