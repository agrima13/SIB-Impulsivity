0.0,34.0,Interviewer,"Okay, Joe, we can go ahead and get started. So as I said, the conversation is recorded for analysis later at IBM by computers. And the point of this part of the study is just to learn a little bit about your life and to learn kind of like what it's like to be you. So how have things been going for you lately, would you say?"
34.0,39.0,Subject,Lately? Like the past three months or something?
39.0,40.0,Interviewer,Sure.
40.0,88.0,Subject,"Yeah, pretty good now. Like I said last time, just been overwhelmed with jobs. New jobs. And they're also pretty good as far as the pay and the actual day-to-day. That's my main thing right now, being adult [laughter]. Being a more responsible adult. And yeah, it's definitely been a lot better than last year, 2016-2017. 2018's been pretty good so far. Trying to keep it that way. And I don't know what else I can say, really."
88.0,90.0,Interviewer,So 2018's been good so far?
90.0,116.0,Subject,"Yeah, pretty much. I just finally got a new laptop again. So that's pretty dope. And yeah. My children just-- their birthday was yesterday. That was cool. I actually just got back to New York. So the timing of the emails and everything was pretty good. And yeah, everything's going [crosstalk]."
116.0,118.0,Interviewer,So you were down in Virginia?
118.0,130.0,Subject,Yeah. Down in Richmond. So we had the festivities and all that. Yeah [laughter].
130.0,132.0,Interviewer,How did it go down there?
132.0,162.0,Subject,"It went pretty good. A couple of things had changed. Kids are becoming little people. That's cool. They're going to start school soon, pretty soon. Yeah. Just making plans ready for later in the year. Maybe I might actually take a trip outside the country."
162.0,164.0,Interviewer,Really?
164.0,191.0,Subject,"So looking forward to that, yeah. First time. And yeah. Everything is just day-by-day for now. Just making sure that everything goes smoothly a couple months from now. And yeah, I don't know what else is really new but it all seems pretty good for now."
191.0,196.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So what was it like being down there, seeing your kids?"
196.0,272.0,Subject,"It's always a little, like, ""Is this real? This is real [laughter],"" kind of thing. And yeah, man, it's a beautiful experience. Kids are-- they kind of just make you forget about the world, in a way. And yeah, to see them grow is just-- it's happening [laughter]. So that's pretty exciting. Yeah. It was cool. Can't wait to actually start properly playing with them more, like sports. Basketball, football, baseball, things like that. Or at least with the boy. With the girl, it's just giving her the best of the best I can give her, although she plays too. Yeah. I don't know what more to say."
272.0,275.0,Interviewer,"So you're thinking about going out of the country, too?"
275.0,375.0,Subject,"Yeah because my-- other side of my family is-- they're Kenyan. And they're really, really Kenyan. Their whole family had only come to the country in 2013, 2014, and they've always been talking about going back. I don't know. I've found a lot of foreigners come to America and they-- I think everyone likes their homeland, no matter where that is. Although I have met some people that come to America like, ""Yeah. I want to stay here. I don't want to go back,"" wherever it is they came from, for whatever reason, whether because it's a bit more exciting, or there's just more opportunities here. But my other side of the family's always been talking about going back. And sometimes some of us do, but-- my girlfriend's mom, she always goes back. She travels a lot because she works for the UN, anyway. But yeah, they might really go back for at least a month or so. It's always talks but it never really happens until I just-- well, do have to get done, I guess, over here, whether it's school work-- and yeah, if it happens, if it does, I will be able to see what Kenya's like. See the culture. I've heard a lot of good things."
375.0,376.0,Interviewer,"Be exciting, huh?"
376.0,380.0,Subject,"Yeah. Even the food for a decent amount of time now, so."
380.0,381.0,Interviewer,"Oh, really?"
381.0,508.0,Subject,"Yeah, man. I want to see-- they always talk about how the fruit over there's just more natural. And I kind of-- my family always, they say the same thing too. Even the bananas here aren't real bananas, apparently. GMO is always like-- I guess a trendy topic, now, and I don't know what they say about the bananas in particular, but even-- any banana you get here, it's not natural because bananas aren't made to grow that big, I guess. And I guess due to, I don't know, technological advances they wanted to make bananas, I guess, more pleasurable and better so they made them bigger. But that's not the natural-- bananas usually come much smaller. Things like that. So I don't know, just more food that-- I always hear how you get the real thing when you go out of the country. And I know-- this is a little off topic, but it's-- they do the same [inaudible] in Mexico. And I have some Mexican friends, and I know that their still drinks, their juices or so, they don't have the high-fructose corn syrup or-- they just have real sugar, cane sugar. I'm sure it honestly probably still tastes the same, but the experience is a good thing, it seems like. And yeah, looking forward to that. But yeah, I mean it's just hard for me to see Monster Online and so much things have always popped up. I know that my priority's just work, work, work, for now."
508.0,510.0,Interviewer,Work's on your mind a lot these days?
510.0,593.0,Subject,"Yeah, a lot because I'm meeting more people at my job and the networking is just going crazy. I don't know if you know Katie Copper? She's a comedian. I just met her recently. She was great. She was cool. And she was a client, basically, for one of my jobs. And I just keep meeting more people, a job, and then I'm getting closer with my coworkers, finding out a lot more about them [laughter]. They're actually pretty cool people. And also, I'm learning that everyone has a side hustle and things like that. And I'm also potentially going to start joining that side hustle that some of my coworkers do, like HVAC. It's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. It's just a trade but it's pretty lucrative. And I've found that a lot of my coworkers, I don't understand how they can afford certain things, like the car that they have. And one of them bought a new house. I'm like, ""Damn, girl, how [laughter]--?"""
593.0,594.0,Interviewer,And that's how?
594.0,661.0,Subject,"And that's how. Right. There's always a way. And yeah, why not? They definitely sold it to me. The pitch was excellent [laughter]. Make it seem like, supposed to work for this long, but we really only work this long [laughter] and we still get paid for working this long. It's like-- I don't know. There's a system when you're out there and you just kind of have to find out how to work it, is what I've found. And yeah, I'm definitely excited to do that, too. So yeah. It's just one step at a time, basically. I'm trying not to get too excited. I'm happy where I'm at. But I know I could do a lot more. So just easing into that transition both professionally and personally, I guess. But yeah, that's mainly what I can recall right now."
661.0,668.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you're easing into the transition professionally and personally?
668.0,688.0,Subject,"Professionally, acquiring possibly another part-time job, and then personally just preparing for that trip out of the country, or that first time on a plane. All those new experiences. First time in a different country."
688.0,691.0,Interviewer,How are you feeling about all that? [crosstalk] maybe?
691.0,741.0,Subject,"Just excited. I don't feel like if anything goes wrong with it-- but I don't know, there's probably going to be some challenges and what not. But I think I'm prepared. I've made it this far in life. Also [laughter] counting down to the 30s, you know? I'm getting closer to 30. And yeah, trying to have some things in order by then. But I have a good three years, so I have enough time. Yeah. So I kind of just want to speed things up, just get there. But enjoying the process is part of it, too. Yeah."
741.0,744.0,Interviewer,Have you been trying to focus on enjoying the process?
744.0,774.0,Subject,"Pretty much. I don't know. Probably just like, if you plan and plan and plan-- but things don't always go according to plan, and new things always pop up. So I guess that's still part of the process. Sometimes you forget things. ""Oh, got to do that."" But yeah."
774.0,778.0,Interviewer,Are some things not going according to plan lately?
778.0,904.0,Subject,"I guess the most recently is finding out that I had to go to the DMV because apparently nowadays-- I got my licence, I think, in 2012. Had my permit when I was 16 or 17. And basically, because I sat on my licence and didn't renew it for-- if I had renewed it probably from three months or something it would have been a much easier and quicker process. I probably would not have even had to go through DMV, given the fact that almost everybody does things online now. It would really have been just as easy as going to the website, nys.dmv.gov or something like that. And pretty much just click a couple of buttons and just renew, and wait for the new licence to come in. But since it's probably been, I don't know, over a year or two since it expired, not only do I have to go through the DMV but I have to, I think, take the road test again and all that, which is-- I understand it. If I technically, or at least legally, haven't been driving for a amount of time, it is a good idea to practice a little bit. But I know how to drive. You can't really forget that, I think. I don't know. I haven't lived long enough yet. But yeah. I'm like, ""Damn, I have to go through that all over again."" So. And the reason why I'm wanting to it is because with my job, I'll get more work if I have a car. So it's-- yeah, definitely something's in the air. And plus it's like, the fact that I do have the wife in Virginia, friends all over, and it's always good to just have a car nowadays."
904.0,906.0,Interviewer,So you're thinking about getting a car?
906.0,909.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely."
909.0,911.0,Interviewer,Cool.
911.0,994.0,Subject,"Yeah, man [laughter]. It's funny because I was given a car when I was younger. But it wasn't a great car and as a teenager living in the city I just didn't feel like I needed it. I thought it would be more responsibility than anything, having the insurance for it and paying gas and things like that. And since it wasn't the best in-shape car-- but then when I went to see my father, he always-- we got to take his cars to the shop every now and then to repair them. And it's not cheap to repair anything, even a mirror. So I was like, ""No, I don't want this. It's too much. I know what can happen."" So I was like, ""No. I'll just stick to the buses and trains. I can get a free Metrocard as a student. I can get anywhere. If you need to go out of state, take a bus, take a train, Amtrak, whatever."" And it's like, of course-- now I'm like, ""Damn, I wish I had that car."" It would probably come in handy right now. Damn. Almost 10 years later. But--"
994.0,997.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. You're feeling like things are different now, and you wish you had it."
997.0,1042.0,Subject,"Right. Yeah. Just sitting there. But you live and you learn. But that's definitely a lesson. Do not look a gift horse in the mouth [laughter]. Yeah. I've got to go to the DMV. Yeah. Just going to [inaudible] test. Going to have to impress the instructor. But yeah, that shouldn't be an issue. Just the time. You've got to probably take a whole-- at least half a day just to do that. Yeah. At the same time, I'm sure you heard about that YouTube thing at the headquarters."
1042.0,1043.0,Interviewer,The shooting?
1043.0,1044.0,Subject,Yeah. That's crazy.
1044.0,1047.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1047.0,1057.0,Subject,"That's the way it is, now. Our country [laughter]. But yeah, I don't know. I don't want to ramble."
1057.0,1061.0,Interviewer,"And has that been on your mind, the YouTube shooting?"
1061.0,1160.0,Subject,"Not really but it is new and fresh. It only just happened yesterday. So yeah, I think it's the first time that it was a female. First time in a while. And yeah, I think that-- it's weird to me that-- I mean, the world's never going to be perfect, but the same thing just keeps happening. I don't know. It's weird to me. And when these things happen it's like-- with the fact that so much outlets report on it, you hear a lot of-- but you can't jump to conclusions, and you have to, I guess, wait a couple days for the facts. I don't know. They said that the shooter-- I don't know if you really read up anything, or saw anything. But I think I saw a report that said the shooter, the female, was-- she had bipolar disorder or something like that. I don't know which type. So I was like, ""Damn. That's relatable."" Because I've been dealing with a lot of people that have that, they're diagnosed with that. I don't know exactly which one she had, but it was like--"
1160.0,1163.0,Interviewer,You've been dealing with a lot of people who have been diagnosed with bipolar?
1163.0,1174.0,Subject,"Yeah. Like my girlfriend, she has that, and a couple of friends have got diagnosed with it in the past year or two."
1174.0,1176.0,Interviewer,"So it felt really relatable, the news story?"
1176.0,1204.0,Subject,"Yeah. It was like-- I don't know. I always think, could things be prevented? Were there any warning signs? Like that. But try not to think about it too much because that, it really has nothing to do with me at all. So--"
1204.0,1206.0,Interviewer,"But it sticks in your mind sometimes, huh?"
1206.0,1276.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's fresh. Yeah. Because with wanting to do things, I always get that thought, like, ""Damn."" Like once I do go back to school, public spaces, just-- yeah. You never know who's going through something. And it's like, I can't stay home all the time. I can't just go to one place all the time. It seems like there's nowhere that it hasn't happened yet. I think with the exception of maybe a hospital, I feel like it's happened everywhere. Schools, theaters, concerts, at a mall, I'm pretty sure. I think it happened at a mall. So it's like [laughter], how do you avoid what you can't avoid? Yeah. So it is what it is, I guess."
1276.0,1278.0,Interviewer,That makes you nervous?
1278.0,1306.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely. Hell, yeah. But yeah. Life does go on. There's no stop and it does not rewind. So got to keep going. Yeah. I don't know what else to say."
1306.0,1315.0,Interviewer,Anything else that-- you said it hasn't gone according to plan lately?
1315.0,1333.0,Subject,"Recently? No, I mean with the exception of when I was applying to certain jobs, not getting certain jobs."
1333.0,1337.0,Interviewer,What was that like? That time of applying for lots of jobs?
1337.0,1528.0,Subject,"It's annoying [laughter]. Nowadays I feel like there's definitely going to be - I've noticed it - some reform in the way that you apply to jobs. But with the way things are changing, it is more common for students to have a laptop at their desk as opposed to a notebook and pen. Certain things are just, I feel like, really outdated when it comes to applying. And I'm seeing my peers address those situations. Like a lot of redundancy when you're applying, like websites who ask you to-- I mean, companies who ask you to apply on the website and it's like, some websites when you attach your resume, it automatically fills in other parts where that might be the same question that they ask again, like work history or address, or schooling, things like that. And then some websites actually make you pretty much type the same thing over [inaudible]. It's just really inefficient when you see how other people, or other companies, do things. And given that in addition to the HVAC thing that I just recently started to look into, I've also been on my own trying to learn how to code and learn computer languages because technology is-- it's clearly not going away, and the need for more, I guess, technological pioneers and people that just know technology, the need is increasing. So I was like, ""Yeah, I'm going to try to learn that."" And I've been noticing that some-- it's usually start-ups or newer companies, they don't even ask for a resume that much. They just want to know if you know how to code. So it's just an experience. Applying can definitely become a tease after a while. But I guess that's just the process. Almost as annoying is applying to colleges, all the information they ask you. But I guess that that's how it is. Applying is definitely something I'd rather get done [laughter] but don't necessarily enjoy going through. You know?"
1528.0,1529.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1529.0,1540.0,Subject,Yeah. Think that covers that topic [laughter].
1540.0,1543.0,Interviewer,"But you haven't had to do that for a while, right?"
1543.0,1747.0,Subject,"Not for two months now. But I feel like I'm probably going to have to do that-- I mean, I've been-- I kind of, I guess, follow-- I don't know if that's the term. I kind of follow-- given that I'm going to be 30 soon, in a couple of years, I use-- not use, but I look up to other people that are 30 and see where they at, what they're doing. And I've just learned some things that I wouldn't learn from, I guess, everybody. Depending on your field, a lot of people don't stay at their jobs that long. It's good to always kind of look for what else is out there. Even in the field that I want to get into, I guess computer science, but it's really programming, most people stay with a company maybe one or two years before they go somewhere else, and that's because you never-- it was told to me that you don't want to be stagnant and-- there's a lot of tricks [laughter], I think, when dealing with companies. Some companies pay new hirees more than they pay their already existing employees. So say you worked at Yahoo or something, been working since 2015. Someone gets hired today, 2018, doing a similar job to you, they might get paid more just because they negotiated that or something. I don't know. The earnings have to increase or something like that. I don't know. The rate of inflation, things like that. But I mean, some companies are, I guess, professional enough, nice enough, whatever the term may be, to not-- to inform you that, ""Oh, yeah, you're getting a raise,"" things like that. But some companies, I guess they won't. It's always in a business's best interests to cut costs, so I can understand why they do it. But you as the individual, you don't want to-- you want your full worth, your full value, basically. And due to competitive salaries and things like that, yeah, you might have a good job but you should always look for more, want more, I guess. That really doesn't stop. I'm surprised because the people that I'm talking to, they have really good jobs. And it's like, they're still not comfortable where they are. So I'm like, ""Yeah [laughter], I guess I will get there too."" Although I kind of am there. But not yet up there, so."
1747.0,1749.0,Interviewer,So you're looking forward to getting up there?
1749.0,1751.0,Subject,Definitely. Definitely.
1751.0,1756.0,Interviewer,"It sounds like you've learned a lot of cool tricks of the trade for professional stuff lately, huh?"
1756.0,1784.0,Subject,"Yeah. Have to. And I'm glad that I have those people in my life to talk to, learn before I get in the door myself. I'm sure once I get in the door I'm going to learn a whole lot of other things, so one day at a time [laughter]. One day at a time. One moment at a time. Yeah."
1784.0,1795.0,Interviewer,"So Joe, is there anything that I didn't think to ask you about that we should know?"
1795.0,1824.0,Subject,"I don't know [laughter]. I don't think so. Not much has changed. It's been a month, right? Yeah. Early April, late March. No. Nothing health-wise has changed too much."
