0.0,24.0,Interviewer,"Okay, so we are rolling. Like I said, this part of the study is recorded for analysis, and the point of this part is just to get to know a little bit about you, to understand what your life is like and what it's like to be you. So why don't you tell me how things have been lately?"
24.0,91.0,Subject,"Well, my name is Ashley; I'm 22 years old. Things have been going well; I've been focused on working out and seeking a full-time job, trying to get my head out of at-home issues. I live with my mom; she's a single mother, and sharing the same home with her, it kind of reflects on me too and bothers me. But other than that, I've been trying to move forward and trying to make sure that I'm happy. The workouts, they have been going great; I've been doing a lot of Pilates, cardio classes, Zumba. Just making sure that I'm healthy."
91.0,93.0,Interviewer,"So, classes; you've been doing a lot of classes."
93.0,94.0,Subject,Yes.
94.0,95.0,Interviewer,Sounds fun.
95.0,111.0,Subject,"I've been doing-- one day I did three classes. Tuesday, I took a break. Wednesday, I had two classes today. Thursday, I'm going to have three classes. Friday, taking a break."
111.0,112.0,Interviewer,Wow; that's a lot.
112.0,139.0,Subject,"Yeah, I just like to keep going; I like to keep active. Aside from singing; singing, I haven't done recently, but I've been thinking about it a lot. And recent competitions that are coming up, so I still have to prepare for that, but that is an option."
139.0,141.0,Interviewer,You have competitions coming up?
141.0,159.0,Subject,"Well, there are competitions coming up; it's just, I haven't signed up yet."
159.0,160.0,Interviewer,Do you think you'll sign up?
160.0,186.75,Subject,"Yes, I think I'll sign up. But I think it's going to be too late because I have to have five arias, which is longer pieces than regular art song, and I only have like three or four, so I just need that one other one, but-- I'm going to try to sign up for it. It's in the Met, so it'll be a huge opportunity."
186.75,187.0,Interviewer,Wow.
187.0,212.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's a lot of pressure, but I think I could do it. When I went to see Madam Butterfly, it was amazing, and something I want to be in; at least like in the choir, not in lead yet, because lead is a lot of pressure, but I think I could do it. I just need a lot of training."
212.0,213.0,Interviewer,Madam Butterfly?
213.0,231.0,Subject,"Yeah. It was amazing. I had a balcony seat seating, and then we had intermission and everyone was just socializing. I've never been to the Met, so it was my first time and it was really-- it was an incredible experience."
231.0,233.0,Interviewer,What was incredible about it?
233.0,284.0,Subject,"It was just being in a place where I wanted, because I always thought of opera as being in Europe, or-- I've done Carnegie Hall, so-- something grand, something not ordinary, so I just thought to myself, ""Why not go to the Met and just see something for the first time, and then see how I like the scene."" Because to myself, I like to do my music elsewhere, because I think they charged it more than how they do it here, so-- I don't know if that made sense, but--"
284.0,286.0,Interviewer,"You like to practice in the other places, you're saying?"
286.0,308.0,Subject,"Yeah. I like to practice-- I would like to practice in Europe. Because a lot of the maestros, meaning the voice teachers, they know more-- Sorry, I just feel like I'm on the thresh--"
308.0,314.0,Interviewer,"Oh, no, you're not. So then, you feel like the maestros in Europe--"
314.0,338.0,Subject,"Yeah; I just think they charge more than they do here. But that's only my opinion; everyone else has their own opinion. And just having that experience overseas, it'll be something that's not common in my life."
338.0,341.0,Interviewer,So you're planning to travel overseas?
341.0,349.0,Subject,"Yes, in the long run."
349.0,354.0,Interviewer,"What makes you want to travel overseas, for training?"
354.0,399.0,Subject,"It's just getting to be in the environment where the citizens of Europe, or whichever part of Europe, is in, and of course they're foreign, and so some don't know English, and being able to come from the States to Europe; I think it would be life-changing, for me and for them, too, because they're getting a feel for what singers in the US are trained-- how they are trained, compared to what they already know in their country."
399.0,409.0,Interviewer,You think it'd be like a cultural exchange almost. That'd be really cool.
409.0,430.0,Subject,"Yeah, that would be amazing. But I'm thinking, one of my friends, she was a part of a Vienna music school, and so I reached out to them, so I have to get back to them on that. Hopefully there's an opportunity there that I can shoot for."
430.0,434.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Wow, what would that be like?"
434.0,467.0,Subject,"Music-related; it's just, I would need more information on the sceneries, or the churches and the singing and-- because the previous one, IES, I was going to Vienna Ball, and then speak with-- sorry, sorry; are you okay? Am I jumping around?"
467.0,478.0,Interviewer,"No, no; no, I'm just listening, understanding. So the previous one, IES--"
478.0,500.0,Subject,"Yeah; IES Abroad, that was a music program in Vienna, and we were going to sing in churches and theaters, and we would get to experience the Vienna Ball. And so, we didn't get to do that; I told you that before."
500.0,505.0,Interviewer,You didn't get to do that. Okay. And you wished you had.
505.0,508.0,Subject,That's what's in my head. That's what I want.
508.0,510.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you've been thinking about doing something like that.
510.0,511.0,Subject,Yeah. I really do want to do something like that.
511.0,521.0,Interviewer,"Sounds really exciting. So what else would be exciting about it, you think, besides the cultural exchange?"
521.0,556.75,Subject,"I think the food, and just getting to know how the people are, and like my commute from point A to point B is completely different in the States, compared to Europe. What else would be different? The animals, maybe? I'm not too sure what's the common animal, but pigeons are here, but Vienna, I'm not sure."
556.75,557.0,Interviewer,It's a whole experience.
557.0,572.0,Subject,"That would be crazy, to set foot on Vienna and not see a pigeon. Or maybe there are pigeons; who knows? I don't."
572.0,579.0,Interviewer,"I was going to say, it sounds like the whole experience, to you, sounds like a really exciting thing; just the whole in its entirety."
579.0,591.0,Subject,Yeah; it is.
591.0,594.0,Interviewer,So that's something you're really excited about and looking forward to?
594.0,619.0,Subject,"Yes, it is. Other than that, work and keeping healthy, and eventually moving into my own apartment, and having a dog."
619.0,621.0,Interviewer,You'd like to have a dog?
621.0,630.0,Subject,Yeah. A Husky. I want a Husky so bad.
630.0,632.0,Interviewer,What makes you want a Husky?
632.0,658.0,Subject,"They're just big, and they're different, and-- I need to study more on the breed, but-- because my family, they have Chihuahuas, they have Jack Russells, Chihuahua and Yorkie mixed, and so they have smaller dogs. So I was never around a big dog."
658.0,663.0,Interviewer,"More huggable, the bigger ones."
663.0,687.0,Subject,"Yes! For the winter. The summer, we go play. I think I want to have a boy, because girls are different. Well, obviously, but you have to deal with the, you know--"
687.0,688.0,Interviewer,A boy dog?
688.0,701.0,Subject,"Yeah; well, the female, you have to deal with periods and stuff, and there's-- males would be better."
701.0,706.0,Interviewer,"Sounds like a good plan that you've got: apartment, the dog--"
706.0,707.0,Subject,Vienna.
707.0,718.0,Interviewer,"Vienna; some really exciting stuff. And right now, it sounds like the working out has been a big thing; is that true?"
718.0,725.75,Subject,"Yes, stress-relief. And also finding a full-time job, and I'm watching a good find, so--"
725.75,726.0,Interviewer,You did find--
726.0,727.0,Subject,I did.
727.0,731.0,Interviewer,Oh? That's exciting. What kind of thing is it?
731.0,738.0,Subject,I'm going to be a receptionist in the city for a vet clinic.
738.0,742.0,Interviewer,That's so cool! When did you find out?
742.0,744.0,Subject,I found out last week.
744.0,745.0,Interviewer,Congratulations.
745.0,747.0,Subject,Thank you.
747.0,748.0,Interviewer,How fun!
748.0,792.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't know what to expect, though, as far as the animals, but as far as the receptionist part, I think I got it down pat. I did get a tour on the clinic, and I saw this one dog, and I guess he was getting ready for surgery, so it was like-- I kept myself together, but I felt bad. Sorry."
792.0,796.0,Interviewer,"So what do you think it's going to be like, the new job?"
796.0,811.0,Subject,"I think I'm going to be alone, so I'll focus more; it's going to be busy, though. I don't really know."
811.0,813.0,Interviewer,Think there'll be Huskies?
813.0,857.0,Subject,"Probably, hopefully. I would love that. What I might have to work on, though, is pronouncing the vitamins and medication, because we do have to take care of that too. To double check the client and then call the company itself and be sure that the medication's on time, and the expiration, and what to tell the customer or client, like how many capsules they have to take and so-- might have to work on that."
857.0,859.0,Interviewer,You think that'll be a challenge that you'll have to face?
859.0,913.0,Subject,"It would be. I think I would. Oh; I recently went to see Chicago. Oh my god, it was amazing. It was-- oh my god, I loved it. Before the show, I saw one of the leads, and I didn't even know she was a lead, and she glanced at me, and I smiled, and - oh my gosh - she is a spectacular performer. Her voice-- so, I'm not crazy about musical theater like that, as a musician myself, but her voice was perfect for it."
913.0,915.0,Interviewer,You're more a fan of opera?
915.0,924.0,Subject,"I am. For me, I can tell what a good voice is, so-- I don't know, it was just something in me."
924.0,931.0,Interviewer,"So what did you think of-- what was cool about it, about seeing Chicago?"
931.0,982.0,Subject,"Honestly, it took you to a different world. There's Roxy and Vivian; Vivian was my favorite, Roxy was the main main lead, Vivian was one of the leads too. So Roxy, she was okay, but Vivian, her voice was just-- her belting range was incredible. And, you know, when I sing, I have to warm up, but when Vivian sings-- I mean, she has to warm up too, but she just makes it sound so easy. I guess there's the training she does get, too, but--"
982.0,987.0,Interviewer,Sounds like you're really enjoying-- admiring the abilities there.
987.0,1026.0,Subject,"Yeah, because as a musician, you have to go to all of these performances and actually judge, in a way, because you like what you like. It's bad, but it's good at the same time. I think it's a good technique for me, so I can see how I can approach my voice, not as a mimic but as-- not a technique, I don't-- it's hard to explain, but I have it mentally."
1026.0,1035.0,Interviewer,Do you mean that you enjoy taking pieces of techniques other people are using to inform your own technique?
1035.0,1048.0,Subject,"Yes. I don't do that 100% of the time, but majority of the time, I do. It's like insight on me."
1048.0,1049.0,Interviewer,So going to this is--
1049.0,1059.0,Subject,Because I don't share with anyone; I just do what I do; I don't really tell anyone how I do things.
1059.0,1062.0,Interviewer,"So going to the theater is a little bit of a learning experience for you, it feels like."
1062.0,1075.0,Subject,"Yes. I know I have to work on my dancing, and my acting, but other than that, I think I have potential."
1075.0,1076.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1076.0,1104.0,Subject,"Yeah. And with the music, getting a Bachelor's in music, it's difficult now, because I have the full time, and then I might have to work weekends, too, so it's going to be hard to maintain both of them. But, hoping for the best."
1104.0,1112.0,Interviewer,So you feel like you would be-- it'll be hard to maintain your job at the vet at the same time as bolstering your music career.
1112.0,1171.0,Subject,"Yes, because the hours might-- my hours now for my job are 7:00 am to 11:00, but the hours for that would be like 12:00 to 8:00 pm, and so during the time when audition, it'll be maybe like 2:00 pm or maybe early, and I wouldn't be able to do that. I think I can do it, time management."
1171.0,1202.0,Interviewer,"So, a lot of new exciting things that you're thinking about. What else is there about you?"
1202.0,1230.0,Subject,"Right now, I don't own a car, so I'm so used to using the trains, so think if I had a car, it would be harder than what I'm already used to, but I do want a car. I need one eventually. I don't know what else to say."
1230.0,1233.0,Interviewer,What would be nice about having a car?
1233.0,1268.0,Subject,"Couldn't getting to point A and point B faster than delays and-- but then there's traffic, so you kind of don't win. But there are places where you can't-- you have to take the Metro-North or Long Island Railroad to get to, like Long Island or upstate, and I'd rather drive than take the Metro-North."
1268.0,1281.0,Interviewer,"I never really got to ask you about, what is it like doing all these classes, the workout classes; that's like a huge part of your life, it sounds like?"
1281.0,1320.0,Subject,"Lately, yes; I just like to keep active, because when I was in college I used to always work out, and since I graduated, within that one year, time frame, I didn't really work out as much, and I was getting lazy, and so I need the fitness classes motivate me and makes me feel happier than being in that place, being lazy and sad. Just thinking about everything first, it's like, keeping active."
1320.0,1322.0,Interviewer,So keeping active helps you keep happy as well.
1322.0,1342.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, it's probably going to be hard to move on, right, because like with my injury, I don't know. They say to keep active, but-- I don't know. Just hoping for the best."
1342.0,1349.0,Interviewer,"You think it'll be difficult to put your body at risk, to keep working out, is that what you think?"
1349.0,1353.0,Subject,"No, it's just-- well, at risk it--"
1353.0,1356.0,Interviewer,"You mean, if, like, you'll hurt yourself or something."
1356.0,1403.0,Subject,"Well, that can be a possibility, but depending on how I approach the workouts and stuff, but-- I don't overwork myself, too. Because it's great to work out and feel relieved after a long day or a long week, but you don't want-- You're like always tired and between--"
1403.0,1405.0,Interviewer,You're always tired in between the workouts?
1405.0,1420.0,Subject,"Oh yeah, sorry. Tired in between the workouts, and the-- my schedule is?"
1420.0,1422.0,Interviewer,Your schedule makes you tired?
1422.0,1432.0,Subject,Yes. Work schedule and physical therapy; then appointments-- gets me overworked.
1432.0,1435.0,Interviewer,What is physical therapy like?
1435.0,1494.0,Subject,"I just do six workouts and divide them into fifteen sets, until-- I would do squats and do 15, 3 times. I don't know how to explain. 3 sets of 15, and I would do arm work outs, and leg workouts, and lower back workouts, and then I'm all set. The people are nice. They're welcoming, and I know everyone now, since I've been going there for a year. I know the doctors, the receptionists, the doctor assistants, and then the physical therapy reps, I guess? I don't know."
1494.0,1501.0,Interviewer,[Inaudible]. You enjoy it?
1501.0,1517.0,Subject,"I do, but sometimes I'm too tired, and I'll miss a day because of my schedule. Waking up from 5:00 am to 11:00, it might seem easy, but it's not."
1517.0,1519.0,Interviewer,It does not seem easy.
1519.0,1574.0,Subject,"Yeah, but it's giving me what I need: money. Work is good, too. Work is different, it's a different environment. I work at a construction site, and so I work with supers and project managers and investigators, and the variation of different positions and different people from different companies, and I represent my own company by being receptionist and working alongside both the supers--"
1574.0,1576.0,Interviewer,What's it like?
1576.0,1589.0,Subject,"At times, it can be very slow, and then at times, I can have 40 people, and so, can be busy. But beginning, I had 80 people."
1589.0,1592.0,Interviewer,Wow. That sounds really intense.
1592.0,1626.0,Subject,"Yeah. Times three pages. But, it kept me going, and I would take water breaks and stuff. But in the beginning, one of the supers was trying to rush me, and asked how long would it take to complete those 80 people? And I couldn't give him an estimate, so I told him, like, an hour or two, but it ended up being until 12:00, like after my shift, so-- I tried."
1626.0,1627.0,Interviewer,In the beginning that happened?
1627.0,1631.0,Subject,"Yeah, but now I got the hang of it."
1631.0,1635.0,Interviewer,You got faster. Cool.
1635.0,1674.0,Subject,"And there's an added step,too; you have to add a certification to the paperwork, and then take more pictures, so I'm getting faster. And it also depends, too, on how many people you have, or I have, because if I have, like, one person, I can take a little longer, versus trying to keep to two minutes or three minutes for each person."
1674.0,1676.0,Interviewer,"So work is a little bit different every day, then?"
1676.0,1718.0,Subject,"Yes, it is. We have the investigators who come in a group, but they never come to me because they're just there for the day, and then they leave, and then we have a group of five to seven people that come in from one company; they have to fill out the application, and then it keeps going."
1718.0,1720.0,Interviewer,"Are you excited to be moving to a new job, though? Or will you be sad?"
1720.0,1728.0,Subject,I am. The goal is to maintain as much as I can with both jobs.
1728.0,1729.0,Interviewer,"Well, can you continue them both?"
1729.0,1756.0,Subject,"Yes; since it's from 7:00 am to 11:00, and then I'll start the second job at 1:00 to like 8:00 or 9:00, and weekends, I'm hoping to have off. If not, it's fine. But as long as I can maintain both, and if not, then I'll just get rid of one and keep on the other."
1756.0,1758.0,Interviewer,Be long days.
1758.0,1788.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't know if I'm ready, but I had long days in college, too; I had like eight hours of schoolwork, and then another four hours to six hours of work, so I would never get home until like maybe after 12:00 am. So I'm just hoping I get a little bit of sleep in each day. Got to hustle."
