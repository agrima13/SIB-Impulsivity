0.0,16.0,Interviewer,"So, as I said, this part is recorded, and the idea of this conversation is just to get to know you better and to understand what it's like to be you. So why don't you tell me how have things been going lately?"
16.0,102.0,Subject,"Things have been good, on an upward trend. I got married about six months ago to my now-wife, Amelia. She's a British citizen. And we met while we were traveling and started dating and then did long distance for a while, but then decided to get married and brought her over here at the end of October or, I guess, beginning of October. And, yeah, we got hitched. And we've been married now for six months. And that's been great, but we've been trying to overcome immigration hurdles and get her green card and get her work eligibility. So it's been a bit of a process making that all happen while, at the same time, I have been trying to switch industries, make a career switch, from the environmental, non-profit sector to mental health. And everything is just starting to come together now. So I said that things were on an upward trend, and that's because they had been tough for a while, for the last six months, maybe a year even, and everything's just finally starting to come together. I just landed a new job. Amelia and I are working out early kinks of living together and all that. And her immigration process is almost at its end. So that's how I'm doing right now."
102.0,103.0,Interviewer,So upward trend right now.
103.0,106.0,Subject,Absolutely.
106.0,112.0,Interviewer,So what was it that you were moving up from? What was it like before?
112.0,140.0,Subject,"Just tough. Just all of those things, all of the things that I was just talking about, any one of those things would have been pretty consuming for an individual. Trying to make an industry shift, trying to get married, trying to work out a new marriage, trying to immigrate someone, trying to start a new career after college-- and between my wife and I, we were trying to do all of those things, all at once, in the middle of a New York winter that never seemed to end [laughter], so."
140.0,141.0,Interviewer,The winter made it worse?
141.0,237.0,Subject,"Yeah. Absolutely the winter made it worse. I'm super affected by the seasons, and I do not believe anyone that says that they are not [laughter]. But, no. Yeah. The winter was just terrible. It was really short days, really cold all the time. We couldn't go out anywhere. And anywhere that we could go out to, theoretically, cost money because during the winter it's pretty much bars and restaurants, and we were poor as shit because I quit my job and was working part-time at Whole Foods and volunteering at Mount Sinai to be able to pursue this career change. And Amelia legally couldn't work. And, yeah. So it was just a really just long period, just really long period, of just really bad situation. And we've got roommates who are great roommates and childhood friends of mine, but with a new marriage and a new experience living together for a prolonged period of time, it's definitely not ideal to share one bathroom between four people and deal with all those living externalities on top of all the stuff that we had going on, so. We'll be moving out at the end of summer which will be nice. That's another upward trajectory thing. But, yeah. That was where it was. It was just three to five life-changing events that we actively decided to pursue all at once. So it can grind you down after a while. And it's just nice to start to see the fruits of our labor."
237.0,239.0,Interviewer,So you've been starting to see the fruits recently?
239.0,331.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, I got that job, like I said. Amelia's got a couple of jobs lined up for when her employment card comes in. And she's found a little bit of work here and there in the meantime. The weather's getting better. And we are really finding a good rhythm with our relationship, which is nice. And we're going to be moving out soon. So it's the sort of thing where things have been so bad for so long, or so hard for so long. I shouldn't say bad. They've been hard for so long. And we're not to a place where we're fully out of that phase, but all of the triggers, all of the sort of checkpoints that we've been looking to get ahold of, are now starting to happen. The job has been secured. The relationship has found a stride. Her work permit is weeks away from being in. And we are two to four months away from being in a new apartment. So we can definitely see the light at the end of the tunnel. And we've got one arm out of the tunnel. But we're not entirely out of it yet, so we're not breathing fine just yet. But the upward trajectory is just the knowledge that we are-- there was a period when we were just in the bottom. And we could feel that we were in the bottom of the trough. And we feel very far away from that now. I feel very far away from that now, so."
331.0,332.0,Interviewer,That's exciting.
332.0,338.0,Subject,Yeah. It's great. It's really cool. I don't know if I'm talking to you or this thing. But cool.
338.0,340.0,Interviewer,Me.
340.0,348.0,Subject,Right on. Yeah. No. It's very cool.
348.0,351.0,Interviewer,So a lot of exciting things happening right now?
351.0,444.0,Subject,"Yeah. Definitely. Still a lot of hard things, still not out of it, but a lot of exciting things. And we kind of set this arbitrary deadline of her birthday, March 23rd, Amelia's birthday, for a time where we would expect things to be better. Her work permit, theoretically, should have been in at the beginning of February. I was hoping to have a job by then, a full-time paid position in mental health by then. And she would have, hopefully, had a job by that point, too, if her work permit would have come in a month and a half, almost two months, prior to her birthday. Like I said, it was going to be in February sometime. We were hoping to have that be the time that things were going to happen. And that time just came and went, and it was really tough. And we're a little bit behind schedule. We're a lot behind schedule for things feeling normal. We were hoping to feel normal by now. But we're definitely at a point where, yeah, just concrete things have happened, things that you can't take back, which is nice. It's not someone saying, ""Oh, it's going to be here in a few weeks,"" or, ""Oh, you submitted an application for this."" We're just getting the results of stuff now which is nice. It's very ideal. Yeah. So it's almost summer, which is great. Long days, t-shirts, all that."
444.0,445.0,Interviewer,You're looking forward to summer?
445.0,452.0,Subject,Absolutely. Yeah. I'm a summer kid. I love summer so much.
452.0,454.0,Interviewer,Because of the t-shirts [laughter]?
454.0,479.75,Subject,"Because of the good weather. I mean, winter's fun, but two months of winter is fun. Summer is just, even when it's super hot out, you just feel a little bit more alive and awake. People are active and people are happier, it seems. And there's just more going on. And, particularly in a place like New York where the winters are just brutal-- and this one wasn't particularly bad, but it was long."
479.75,480.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
480.0,481.0,Subject,So.
481.0,483.0,Interviewer,Totally.
483.0,485.0,Subject,Yeah.
485.0,489.0,Interviewer,What else are you looking forward to about the summer?
489.0,501.0,Subject,"Getting into a new neighborhood. We're in Bushwick right now, Amelia and I, and we're going to move to the Upper West Side. And I love the Upper West Side. It's great. There's a lot of restaurants that I like there."
501.0,502.0,Interviewer,Not Bay Ridge?
502.0,523.0,Subject,"Not [laughter] Bay Ridge. We are not moving farther down into Brooklyn. My commute is already going to be hard anywhere so this will actually-- the Upper West Side is the one place where it's a nice commute. And, for Amelie, anywhere she lives, it's going to be like a half-hour commute for her, so. Which is-- I know. It's nice, right?"
523.0,524.0,Interviewer,It's insane.
524.0,596.75,Subject,"So we could live Upper West Side, Upper East Side, lower Manhattan, pretty much anywhere close to the water in Brooklyn. Even down by you, her commute would probably be like 40 minutes, maybe 50 from you. But, still, really not-- no, probably still 40 minutes. Long Island City would be 25 minutes. She's just very-- she's in Greenwich Village. So it's just-- all the trains kind of run through there one way or another. So, yeah, Upper West Side. It's going to be great, more space, more adults, people that are just living lives and don't have shaved eyebrows, dyed [laughter] hair, and all of that crap. So that's going to happen during the summer. And I'm excited to be in that-- well, we're already married. But we're going to do another wedding in the summer, too, like a formal one with family coming out because the last one was a little too last-minute for her family, her British family, and my Seattle-based family to get out to New York. So we're doing that June 2nd. We have a week in Greece that her mom got us as a wedding present slash-- yeah. We're going sailing on a yacht for a week in Greece with her mom and--"
596.75,597.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my god."
597.0,600.0,Subject,"--her stepdad. Yeah, it's going to be amazing."
600.0,601.0,Interviewer,Wow.
601.0,602.0,Subject,Yeah.
602.0,603.0,Interviewer,This summer?
603.0,628.0,Subject,"September. Yeah. So end of summer. But we've got that to look forward to. Yeah. I just generally like running around in the park. You can't go and hang out in Central Park for a whole day in the winter. You can do that during the summer, so. Yeah."
628.0,642.0,Interviewer,So this summer is exciting. It's coming up. So what else are you looking forward to about the next stage that you're coming to?
642.0,776.0,Subject,"Well, this new job is the first real concretely-secured step in my path towards being a mental health professional. I want to go to grad school. I want to get a Ph.D. in clinical psych. And having a forty-hour-a-week, salaried position, that's a real step to getting into grad school and a step to learning more about the industry and, actually - I don't know - feeling like a contributing member, in a way. Where I was volunteering here and that was nice, but it was also just kind of-- I could come. I could go. There wasn't a lot of responsibility attached to it. It didn't give me a lot of-- I mean, it definitely was my most driving thing, professionally. And I made the most out of it. But I like that I'm going to be asked a lot of at this new job. So, yeah. I'm just very excited about that. And it's a place with a great pedigree. And it's got some prestige to it. And I'm going to meet some people and make some connections that I think will help along the way, too. But, yeah. This is just the thing before the thing, which-- it's like grad school eve where-- well, I guess applications will be grad school eve. But, still, it is the thing before the thing, whereas I was just before doing the thing before the thing before the thing. And, yeah. It just feels like I've not only got my foot in the door. It feels like I am in the door. And there's still a lot of work to do with grad school. But if I made the most out of my volunteer experience here it would not-- I mean, it would have improved my chances of getting into grad school. But it wouldn't have been a really big accomplishment to be proud of, just volunteering two days a week. But I think that this is by no means a ticket, but it's definitely a big check in a box that says he did this, he's worth being considered."
776.0,778.0,Interviewer,"That's really exciting, professionally."
778.0,881.0,Subject,"Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. It's very exciting, professionally, to have that under my belt. Well, not under my belt, getting under my belt now, going to start it. Yeah. Very exciting, professionally. That's what's exciting. Well, that's one of the things that's exciting. And then also just returning to normal life because all the stuff I described earlier is very-- Amelia and I have been living below the threshold. We've been living in a bit of a trough of an existence right now for what we know that we're capable of and what we want to do. And it's been necessary to get to the next peak or plateau, ideally, where we can consistently be at a happy level. But I'm just very excited to be in a place where we feel like we've got our heads above water again, not even to be thriving, which I think we almost have this expectation that our naturally tendency is to thrive, so maybe this will be that. But just to be doing the same thing five days a week and have the opportunity to go out for a drink and a dinner on the weekend with friends and be able to plan my life more than six months in advance. That is what I want, just shit that normal people should be able to do. What is expected of a stable adult life, we just don't have right now, but we're starting to get. And that's one of the big things that I'm very excited about. That's kind of this professional excitement that I have is wrapped up in that."
881.0,883.0,Interviewer,In the personal excitement that it was going to foster?
883.0,969.0,Subject,"Yeah. Absolutely, just this general life stability like personal excitement. And then moving to a new apartment has got the romantic inter-social, life partner excitement aspect kind of wrapped up in it. Moving to a new apartment with Amelia so that we can really feel like we're homemaking or domesticizing or whatever it is, nesting. Amelia and I have been looking forward to that for a while. And so it's just a lot of turmoil. There's professional. There's financial. There's personal. There's romantic. Everything had been turned upside down in the last two years with the intention, with a very productive intention, of getting to a place of improved normalcy above where we were before we turned everything upside down. And that's all on the horizon. A lot of it's just going to take time for these things to get accepted. A lot of it's out of our control. I'll just have to keep working, and then I will get paychecks. And I'll have to keep working, and then I'll start learning. And I'll have to keep working, and then it will feel normal. And then Amelia and I will have to move, but our lease isn't up. So it's like all these things. And she'll have to start working, but her work permit's not in yet. A lot of it's just us continuing to wait. But we're at the end of a waiting period before that normalcy can kick in again, that general life excitement. It's got all of those different components."
969.0,974.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you're at the end of this era.
974.0,1195.0,Subject,"Yes. We are at the end of the middle. We had the beginning, and we were at the beginning of the beginning. Then we were at the end of the beginning, and the end of the beginning was all the applications and all of that. The beginning of the beginning was figuring things out and deciding what we wanted out of life, me deciding that I wanted to go to grad school and Amelia deciding that she wanted to come to the US and pursue nursing, us deciding that we wanted to get married. And then the middle of the middle was like, all right, what do we need to do to get there, all of the planning that went into everything. I need to quit my job. She needs to come over. We need to apply for visas. We need to get married. She needs to look at nursing programs. I need to look at graduate school programs. And then the end of the beginning was me quitting my job, Amelia moving over, or her securing her first visa. And then we were over here. And then the beginning of the middle started which was getting all these other applications out, her green card application, me posting for jobs. And then this middle phase was just so bad. It was so bad because it was just application after application after application and just asking people for permission to do things that we knew how to do and that we were confident that we could get done. Like, we love each other to death. We wanted to get married. Please let us have a marriage license. Amelia wants to contribute to the US economy and has a higher IQ and better work ethic than the vast majority of US citizens. Let her give you her taxes. Please. I have a more adept social IQ and general IQ-- I don't know. I'm just a very in-tune person, I think, with the human condition, and I think I'd flourish in this field. And just let me have a job. I'm going to be crunching numbers and just posting shit into Excel and organizing posters on PowerPoint for the first ten years anywhere. Any monkey with a degree can do that. Let me do it. What do I need to prove? So it was just like the middle was tough because there was just a lot of, ""Please, can I do this menial thing? Please, please, please?"" And people being like, ""We'll see about it. Yeah [laughter], get back to us in six months."" And six months is almost up on all fronts, right? People are eventually saying, ""Okay. All right. You've been living off of rice and getting up at four in the morning for long enough now. We'll let you do the thing that you wanted to do."" So that's the middle [laughter]. We're almost toward the end of the middle. And the beginning of the end is going to be, I think-- the real beginning of the end is going to be when we get that new apartment because the wedding will be over. All of the family will have come out and seen us celebrate our love for each other [laughter] which is cool. I shouldn't say it like that [laughter]. It's cool. Amelia will have her work permit. She'll be in a job. I'll be in a job. And that'll all be kind of celebrated by us being in a new environment. Shed all those old tough, hard memories which were good and valuable and foundational to the relationship. But we can't, I can't, go back to Bushwick anymore. It's so tarnished with all that hardship. So the beginning of the end of this phase of our lives will kind of coincide with the beginning of the beginning of the next phase, so."
1195.0,1201.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what do you think it's going to be like to build your nest--
1201.0,1202.0,Subject,At the new place?
1202.0,1203.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1203.0,1348.0,Subject,"Oh, just - I don't know - just nice. It'll feel like our life. Being in the apartment that we're in now, it doesn't quite feel like it's our life. As much as you want it to be a married couple that have a life and a place. And there's this home base. And you can kind of have a routine of Amelia cooks, I clean, I cook, she cleans, she vacuums the bedroom, I sweep the whatever. And you can just kind of get into this routine which allows you to just kind of find a sense of calm and security in this home base so that you can go out and do the things that are really exciting outside of there. You don't have when you're living with roommates. Which is fine when you're single because your life is just reckless [laughter]. Which is good. But it's just like, ""Oh sure. I'll go and get drinks with you on 10 at night on Thursday."" But when you've got another person, and you're trying to accomplish all these bigger things, it's just hard to do when you have four people sharing one bathroom and cupboard space and kitchen and living room where you can't put out any personal pictures because your roommate feels like you're leaving your shit around. Yeah. Right? But we're just excited to get to a thing, get to a place where we can do all of that, just kind of build a life. And that's the core of it is the nest, is the apartment. That's where you come back to. When you're tired at the end of the day, when you've gone out and tried something, when you've applied for a job and it didn't work and you need a place to feel safe, you come back there. Maybe you get a drink first, then you come back there. Something good happens, you want to celebrate it. You can bring it back there. You can invite people over to have a party or whatever. It's nice to have something that's your own in the world, and right now we don't really have that. So that's the big thing about nesting which is going to be nice, just having our something because right now we're sharing it with a Facebook engineer that doesn't shave and [laughter] my childhood best friend, which has its pros and cons [laughter]. Yeah. Where are we at? How many minutes?"
1348.0,1349.0,Interviewer,Twenty-two.
1349.0,1354.0,Subject,Okay.
1354.0,1362.0,Interviewer,So Amelia mentioned that you're going to be doing the Pacific Crest Trail.
1362.0,1365.0,Subject,"Hell yeah. Yes, we are."
1365.0,1367.0,Interviewer,What do you think that's going to be like?
1367.0,1507.0,Subject,"Great. That's actually going to be the interlude between the beginning of the next beginning and the end of this end. In two years, we're going to be on the trail, this time in two years. And it's just going to be a really-- I call it our honeymoon. I think it's our honeymoon. Amelia thinks Greece is our honeymoon. I think this is our honeymoon [laughter]. It's a five-and-a-half month honeymoon. Yeah. Talk about catharsis and shedding of past stages of your life way more so than moving into a new apartment will be. This will be because I will, hopefully, have secured a position at a post-baccalaureate program or a Ph.D. program somewhere on the west coast by this time to start as soon as we finish the Pacific Crest Trail. And Amelia will, hopefully, have found her way into a nursing program or being looking at jobs over on the west coast. And we're going to leave all of New York behind. And there's everything that I'm excited about with the trail itself that's going to be exciting. But all the symbolism around it is just really nice, where it's like these next two years are positioned to be really fun in New York in a new apartment with us and a new neighborhood and have all these goals accomplished. But it's still going to be in New York. And we love it here but we also hate it [laughter] here. So that'll just be a real big marker of this was the infancy of our marriage and of this really big change in our lives. And I think that that's a really good cutoff or a really good cap for that infancy. And we'll probably be toddlers. We're still going to be super young over there, but we're not idiots anymore. We're just going to be really stupid [laughter] which is a huge upgrade. We're going to be making less dumb mistakes once we're done with that, is our goal. Who knows, but--"
1507.0,1510.0,Interviewer,Your goal for the PCT is to [crosstalk].
1510.0,1531.0,Subject,"Oh, no. Our goal by the time-- not for the PCT itself, but for that next phase of our life. And the PCT, the Pacific Crest Trail, is a really good demarcated line in the sand, if you will. It's a big line up the west coast that is-- we are going to be on the western side of this after this."
1531.0,1531.75,Interviewer,Yeah.
1531.75,1532.0,Subject,And--
1532.0,1534.0,Interviewer,"Oh, the symbolism is great."
1534.0,1536.0,Subject,Yeah. I never thought about that before just now. Isn't that beautiful?
1536.0,1537.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1537.0,1655.0,Subject,"Oh, that's nice. I like that. I'm going to tell Amelia that. But yeah. That's really what it is. I guess we're going to be from Mexico to Canada, and we're just going to kind of draw our line in the sand. But the trail itself is going to be fun. The mechanics of actually hiking the trail is going to be a blast. I rode my bicycle from San Francisco to here, and that was the inspiration to do another long sort of pilgrimage, just because it's so much fun. It's such an adventure. You're just outside for five months straight. Oh, my god. There's nothing better in the world. You wake up with the sun. You go to bed with the sun. You eat so much food. Everything tastes amazing because you're starving all the time [laughter]. Showers are the most amazing thing because you have them once every 15 days. You really get all the benefits of being thrown into prison for 20 years [laughter]. You really enjoy all the small things. If you were to try and find silver linings in being in prison or being thrown into a work camp or something, it's like you really enjoy a loaf of bread, or you really like seeing the sun rise. It's beautiful. And those are things that you don't get to see if you're caught up in the machine of New York City or any major city or working nine to five. But you don't have to go to jail to do it. You get to walk in nature all day, every day. So it's just my height of being is doing these outdoor adventures for long amounts of time. There is nothing that I have found that is better than that. It's very cool. Urban travel isn't as fun. Extreme sports aren't as fun. Indulgences described earlier aren't as fun. It's just the best. And to do it with your best friend, to do it with my wife, oh, very exciting. Yeah. So looking forward to that a lot."
1655.0,1658.0,Interviewer,What was it like when you rode your bike across the country?
1658.0,1658.75,Subject,It sucked.
1658.75,1659.0,Interviewer,Really?
1659.0,1751.0,Subject,"No. I'm kidding. No, it did. It was the opposite of New York where we have to say we love New York as the qualifier, but then we're like, ""No, but it really sucks here [laughter]."" It's the opposite of that where people are like, ""How was it riding your bike across the country?"" And we're like, ""It was terrible. We were tired and hungry, and we had all these injuries, and we were super unprepared. But, no, actually it was amazing."" It's the total opposite of where we are now. It was so fun. We had no idea what we were doing. We planned the whole trip-- I say I planned the whole trip over six months. Ben, my college best friend, had no part in planning it. I tried to get him on Skype calls, and he'd just be hung over and be like, ""What's up, man [laughter]?"" And I was like, ""All right, so we won't do this. These are the places we want to see."" But then planning the actual route, the actual stop-to-stop route, we did on Google Maps which was super useful. But we did that in a weekend over a day and a half, pretty drunk [laughter], and then a month before we left. And then I went down to California ahead of him to stay with some friends, and he just kept on doing his thing. And we didn't train. I did three 60-mile rides before I left and half a dozen 40-mile rides. And we were averaging 85 miles a day. My left knee was so swollen with fluid that it looked - I'm not kidding you - it looked like half of a baseball was on top of it."
1751.0,1752.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my god."
1752.0,1795.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't have any pictures of it. I have a couple pictures with my brace on where you can kind of see puffing out. But it was ten days in. We were pretty convinced-- not pretty convinced, but it was really dire. And we were in the middle of the dessert, and my spoke blew out on my back wheel. And we had to get a ride into town, and we were 50 miles from civilization in either direction in this little 20-person town called Rachel. It's right near Area 51 [laughter]. And it was 110 degrees during the day. And my knee was just-- I mean, every pedal was terrible. And we didn't have the right braces for it, so I took a styrofoam cup at this motel thing that we were at that was just trailers in the middle of the desert. It was called Little A'Le'Inn, like little alien."
1795.0,1796.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's good.
1796.0,1822.0,Subject,"And so I took one of the big styrofoam cups, and I cut the top rim out of it because it's kind of curved. And I cut it into quarters, and I doubled them up onto each other. And then I took some duct tape that we had and wrapped them. And I had a brace, the wrong type, and I shoved them in the bottom and the top to support my tendons. And that's how I rode out over two mountain ranges the next day till we got to the right town to be able to get me the right type of brace."
1822.0,1823.0,Interviewer,Jesus.
1823.0,1942.0,Subject,"But sitting in that bar, getting back to things being shitty and us not planning properly or us training properly-- we were sitting in a bar having a drink, and we changed our route that day is what we did. Because we were going to go south to the Grand Canyon, but the weather forecast had it at 115. And we wanted to go down to the bottom, and we weren't going to survive if we did that. And then we wanted to hike around it, and, again, it just wasn't going to be realistic to do because there's such a lack of shade throughout the day that even when you rest you can't really get any reprieve. So we changed our route. And I was just talking to Ben, and we just-- we're looking at each other, and I was like, ""I don't know if I can keep going."" And he was like, ""Well, our options are stay in this shitty, terrible town forever [laughter] or bike out of here."" And I was like, ""No, that's a really good point. I guess we'll just have to finish going across the country."" And that was it. That was the last time that I complained. And Ben had some issues later on with his leg and a rash [laughter] that he got, a really bad rash. But yeah. After that, we were pretty gung ho. Yeah. That trip was nuts. But it was so fun. It was terrible because all those sorts of things happened. But looking back on them, even in the moment, the next day, you were like, ""This is a real thing that's happening. This is not a nothing day."" Every single day felt like three days is what we told people. Imagine the most exciting day you've had in the last three months. Think about the most jam-packed, crazy, awesome, done so much in that day. Whatever that day is out of the last three months of your life, or even year of your life, multiply it times three, and that was every single day for us. We would, at the end of a day, reminisce about that day and go, ""Oh yeah. And do you remember when this?"" Every day that would happen. And you would have to jog your memory about something that happened eight hours ago because so many things happened."

1943.0,1985.0,Subject,"Yeah. So it was cool. I love talking about it. But we're hoping to-- we ran into some people on day five that were hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, and they were two and a half months in, or three months in, at that point to their journey. And we were four days in, and our whole journey was only going to take two months. So they were more than our full journey's duration into theirs, and they were only halfway through. And talking to them, they said that it was just-- one of them had ridden his bike across the country, these guys that we met. And he said that if you love this trip by the end of it, then you have to do the PCT. Because halfway in it's just as good, for a number of reasons, and better, for a number of reasons."
