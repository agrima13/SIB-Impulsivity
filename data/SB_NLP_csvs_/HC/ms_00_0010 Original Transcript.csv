1.0,21.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So we're recording. As I said, for this part, we're going to record an informal conversation, and the idea of this part of the study is just to get to know you and to understand what it's like to be you. So how have things been going for you lately?"
21.0,34.0,Subject,"You know, a bit chaotic, but relatively fine, considering, I guess. Do you want me to expand a bit?"
34.0,36.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah.
36.0,37.0,Subject,Okay.
37.0,39.0,Interviewer,So they've been chaotic because of the immigrations.
39.0,74.0,Subject,"Yeah, basically. A lot of delays with my paperwork, so a lot of upheaval with jobs and being able to maintain a job. And so on Friday, I had to leave a job, hopefully temporarily, but it's kind of fine at this point. It's plateaued into just an expectable amount of chaos. So yeah. It's not been so bad. But yeah. Certainly a lot of upheaval. And uncertainty to a degree, I think. Yeah."
74.0,78.0,Interviewer,So you feel like it's sort of flowed into an expectable amount?
78.0,148.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's a funny thing. I think I really was fighting against it for about three of the last six months. I was really frustrated and just really angry, and almost ready to just shove someone on the subway or something. And then it just-- I don't know. I started meditating again to get back on track. Because I felt like there'd been so many swings with how life was going that I just needed to get my feet back on the ground. So I started meditating and reading some developmental books again, and it just meant when this came around on Friday, it was like, ""Okay, I can pretty much accept that, and I can work out what to do with that time."" And I think, mentally, I've written off the next couple of months anyway. I think I knew it was going to be chaotic, and I knew that there was not job security, and so I just was able to kind of-- yeah, accept it, until maybe the summer when I would expect things to be back to normal, or feel normal. Like a sort of normal life, I guess. Yeah. Does that make sense?"
148.0,149.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, totally."
149.0,150.0,Subject,Cool.
150.0,157.0,Interviewer,So what has it been like with the uncertainty the last few months?
157.0,222.0,Subject,"It's been very frustrating. I think that, for me, I'm someone who takes the approach that if I keep working hard enough, and I keep working at it, and I just keep hitting it, then it will resolve itself. And it's kind of like trying to fight smoke almost. Because there's nothing I can do. I can work as hard and run as fast as I could, but I'd just stay on the same spot. There's literally nothing I could do. I've never been in such an uncontrollable situation, where I can't just be like, ""Okay, this strategy, or this strategy. I'm going to try this."" There's literally nothing I can do except to wait, which is really uniquely frustrating. So I think an acceptance has sort of emerged about four months in, of that being like, ""Okay, this is too big. No matter how hard I work, or if I game it, it just is what it is."""
222.0,225.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. What a great analogy, ""Like fighting smoke."""
225.0,259.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's really really funny. I've never had something I can't just grab, and just go, ""Right, we're going to sort you out."" And I think for this kind of process, a lot of people would naturally flow around the problem, and actually be okay, and just wait. And I think I was uniquely unprepared for what the process ended up being. So it's interesting to have actually feeling relatively relaxed about this new challenge as of Friday come up. It's a good thing."
259.0,261.0,Interviewer,So you felt uniquely unprepared.
261.0,289.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm quite strong-headed and quite determined. Any achievement, I've had it pretty much placed on the back of my own labor. So I just expect things to work out if I worked at them. And it's just really weird having something that I can't just make work for me, I guess."
289.0,294.0,Interviewer,"It feels like something that's more challenging than what you've met before, and less in your control?"
294.0,332.0,Subject,"Definitely. I don't know how to describe it, really. I guess anything that I've taken on that's as big as this, or could be equated to this, is something I chose to do. And there were steps to take, and there was various ways I could achieve it. Whereas this is still a really big thing that will feel like an achievement at the end of it, but I'm relying on a bunch of bureaucrats to make a decision on me, somewhere in the distance that they don't know me and I don't know them. Sorry, I don't know if I'm saying that right."
332.0,334.0,Interviewer,"No, it makes total sense. Yeah."
334.0,338.0,Subject,Yeah. Yeah.
338.0,347.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So how were things going before this recent saga?
347.0,414.0,Subject,"Pretty well, actually. I just graduated in June, so really the last [inaudible] have been a big focus on my degree. That was the major thing, as well as the long distance with Alex which was going on. So things were going well. I was pretty stressed, but like I said, it's like, ""You know what you're dealing with. You know exactly what you've got to do, you just got to have the guts to do it, and turn up to the exam."" And so it felt very manageable, as much as it was quite daunting. And I did well in my degree, and that was actually a-- the degree was a huge thing for me, in terms of what I achieved. So, yeah. I didn't think I was very smart at school, and so getting the degree, and a really good degree, was pretty cool. So it kind of went from this time of elation and relaxation around summer, and then to just diving into immigrating. It was a year of two halves, really. Yeah."
414.0,415.0,Interviewer,So what was the summer like?
415.0,490.0,Subject,"The summer was good. It was just before everything kicked off. So I basically graduated, and then hung around university for four weeks, and just hung out with friends just to say goodbye. It was really relaxing. And then spent eight weeks in New York with Alex, but still basically on-- you know, as a sort of-- it was my vacation, really. And that was lovely, and we just kind of explored the city. And then prepared to go home, to take my immigration into use. So it was pretty relaxing. There was this feeling of, ""Things are about to start."" Like the quiet before the storm. But I was enjoying the process, up until that point. Doing the paperwork was a bit like a school project. Yeah. And I actually really needed the break. It was almost a relief my interviews went until September because I actually didn't want to do anything. I think I would have felt like I had to get a job, but it was like, ""I can't do anything, I just have to relax this summer."" So it was, yeah, it was really nice, and I spent like a month at home with my mom before I left, which was great. And just, yeah."
490.0,492.0,Interviewer,"And you got to spend eight weeks just hanging out in New York, too."
492.0,513.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Which was nice in the summertime. I just sunbathed and did absolutely nothing, and it was great. Yeah."
513.0,519.0,Interviewer,So how do you feel about things as you look forward? How are things feeling?
519.0,562.0,Subject,"In the short term, a little tough. In the long term, very optimistic. We very much feel like-- I think Alex and I both, because our plans have obviously aligned. Yeah, very positive. Especially in the long long term, like five, ten, twenty years. I feel very optimistic for how things will be, and what I hope things will be. I'm very positive, I think, overall, which is good. Yeah. Gets you up in the morning. Yeah. And again, I think excited too. I think we've both got big plans and big things we want to do after this. So, yeah."
562.0,563.0,Interviewer,What kind of plans?
563.0,635.75,Subject,"So in about two years, we're going to hike the PCT, which is the Pacific Crest Trail, and which will be about five months. So I think that'll feel like real freedom. I mean, we'll plan it, we'll leave New York, and we'll just be hiking for five months. And it'll be, I think, a real refresh for us as well, getting out of here. And then, you know, Alex will do his study thing, and I will, assuming I get in, begin nursing school. Which just means I'll actually be doing and starting what I actually want to do. And so I'm really excited to do that. That's the job I feel that I want to be in. And then I can-- yeah, that is contentedness, with comparing this time in New York for the next two years of just [inaudible] going to be a bit of a struggle, got to save money, got to make it work, and just hold down a job. And then really, once we start the PCT, that's the beginning of, ""Right, we're actually doing what we want to be doing."" Yeah. And so [inaudible] we just continue after that."
635.75,636.0,Interviewer,That's really exciting.
636.0,638.0,Subject,Yeah.
638.0,642.0,Interviewer,So two years from now feels like the time when the exciting things will start.
642.0,669.0,Subject,"Yeah, exactly. This is all-- we're just doing the back work for it, for these things, to allow them to happen. So it's kind of-- we're very much-- bollocks. We both have the disposition of playing the long game, I think. I certainly do. Of just withholding gratification for two years, I guess. Yeah."
669.0,678.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm. So what do you think will be gratifying about those things coming two years from now?
678.0,782.0,Subject,"I think literally the physical living environment will be a major thing. Just being somewhere a bit quieter, closer to nature, somewhere where the opportunities for just getting out of the city is so much greater. I think contentment in terms of career will be pretty major. I very much feel at the moment that I'm exchanging labor for money, and it's absolutely fine, but I could not do a desk job for any longer than two years. It kind of crushes my soul a bit. And I think the nursing, just as a life ambition, will be very rewarding, and suits my personality very well. In terms of it's very proactive, and you're doing things, but you're also applying a scientific discipline, so the science-- being able to work within the sphere of science will be very exciting to me. So I think that I won't be experiencing what I experience at the moment, which is like, ""Oh, I have to go to work. Alright, so now I get to leave, thank God. How much did I earn today? Okay, that's good. I can save up that money."" I can actually just fully be in the job that I'm doing because every day is what I'm wanting to do, and where I want to be. So it will feel much more like a choice than life feels now. So, yeah. And then, I guess... don't know what else. Yeah."
782.0,784.0,Interviewer,You're really excited about the career that's coming.
784.0,858.0,Subject,"Yes. Definitely. Yeah. I really object to desk work. I honestly don't know how people can do the corporate thing. I just think-- I don't know. I had quite an alternative upbringing, and I went to a Steiner school, and I think I just lived in a floaty, happy community. And so I think I just have an allergic reaction to anything that I consider to be bullshit, essentially. It's not doing anything for the world. It's more that feeling of, ""Gosh, when I get to 40, what if I don't feel like I have contributed anything?"" And it's not in any kind of ego way, of like, ""Oh, how much will I be remembered?"" It's just like, ""Well, I don't want the time to slip by, and I don't want to have not made the world ever so slightly better."" That'll be rubbish. What's the point in doing anything if you're not making some kind of contribution? So, yeah. Sorry, I actually forgot your question [laughter]."
858.0,866.0,Interviewer,"No, no. So that's one of the things you're looking forward to most about this career you're choosing, is making a difference."
866.0,896.0,Subject,"Yeah, I think so. I mean, it will be mentally very stimulating, and socially very stimulating as well. So there obviously-- there are aspects that are in it for me. It's not entirely-- what's the word? When you just give things for nothing back. So, yeah, it'll do an awful lot for me, but it will make me feel like I'm living life to the fullest, I guess."
896.0,899.0,Interviewer,"Living life to the fullest because you're giving back, you mean? Or--"
899.0,952.0,Subject,"Yeah, I think so. Yeah. [inaudible] And there's an excitement element, for me, personally, that gives me the impetus to do it, but... Yeah. Yeah. I think I'd have to be doing something that was bigger than me, or bigger than just the machine of making money. It doesn't have to be nursing, and so direct as that. Like, my brother's going into academia, and into doing a Ph.D. in ecology, and that's also, I think, on a par with just-- you're expanding the world that you're inhabiting, and then you leave it having given something. Whereas I imagine if you just worked in the finance center, it's just like, ""What's the point?"" Why would you do that? Because you'll go, and it didn't matter that you were around. So--"
952.0,955.0,Interviewer,"You expanded your pockets, but not the world?"
955.0,992.0,Subject,"Yes. Yeah. Exactly. And it's totally fine if people want to do that, I just-- it's personal to me that-- there are various layers to that, in terms of my personal development, just emotionally. So, you know, meditating, reading these books, I don't want to get to 40 and have lots of layers and be bitter and be angry. There's a lot of things that I want to become before I die, basically. I don't want to feel like I wasted my time. So, yes."
992.0,996.0,Interviewer,"So what do you like about meditating, and about the books?"
996.0,1115.0,Subject,"I think meditating-- it surprised me. I stopped for a little while, but I really got into it in September. It just calms me down, basically. I have a pretty active mind, and I think lots of thoughts every day, and I sometimes think ten thoughts a second. So it just almost creates space in which to... yeah. It just makes me more relaxed and more grounded. And it means that I'm more aware of where my emotions are at, not just when they're really extreme. I am almost able to track them, so that if I start to get agitated on the tube, it never bursts forth as actual anger, and I don't have to, I don't know, feel like an angry person. I go, ""Oh, okay, I'm getting a bit angry. Alright. That's interesting."" And then you can just move on. So I just tend to just feel more content and calm, and then it's easier to deal with anything that comes up. And then the books are just good, because I think the books are more of a good talking to. The parts of myself that I dislike, like being very judgmental, or being too emotional and getting angry, or just-- mostly it's just being anxious, and feeling like this is too big of a challenge to deal with, and just feeling like, ""Oh my gosh, I can't do it."" Which I think is a big inclination with-- you can contradict me, with women in general, where we kind of assume, ""Oh my god, I can't do this."" Or, ""I'm not qualified,"" or something. And it just tends to-- I like the clarity of these books, because they just give you tools, and then you know: ""This problem emerges, I will use this tool."" It's quite functional. It's... yeah. Brain training is the same as training your body to do something. Yeah."
1115.0,1118.0,Interviewer,So you feel like the books have helped you train your brain to deal with things?
1118.0,1229.0,Subject,"Definitely increasing, yeah. I had intense periods of reading these books, and then I really stopped reading them at probably the worst time, over Christmas and the New Year, when the shit was really hitting the fan, and then came back to them. Yeah. But I want to feel like I'm expanding myself, and I'm a better person this year than I was last year, and I'm a more adult person. I hate being like a child, which I feel like I just regress to when things get tough, just being stroppy or [inaudible] or whatever. Whereas these help me to deal with issues like a grownup. Because I think I feel like I'm quite young in myself, so there's a weird-- not paradox, but there's this two sides of, on the one hand, feeling I'm doing very grand things-- I'm married, and I've moved country, but I also was pretty young, even for a 22-year-old, when this stuff all started happening, still quite like a child. So I feel like I'm not that equipped to deal with big life things, and I'd like to be, and I'd like to look back and be able to say that, ""Okay, I dealt with that really well."" Rather than just freaking out on people, which is very undesirable. I hate the thought that I irritate people by my own inability to handle things, I guess."
1229.0,1230.0,Interviewer,Makes sense.
1230.0,1235.0,Subject,Yes [laughter].
1235.0,1244.0,Interviewer,So what are you looking forward to about the Pacific Crest Trail?
1244.0,1343.0,Subject,"Getting out of New York. I grew up in the country. I cannot wait to just be surrounded by beauty. I'm so sick of just ugliness and cement and tarmac. Being outdoors makes me feel really good and really free. I'm excited for the physical challenge, because as much as it will be relaxing, it will be a challenge, and it will be fantastic to complete it, and will be a real achievement. And I think I'm very excited just to do it with Alex, and that being something that we did together as a couple. I think that will be very nice for our relationship as well. Yeah. I don't know what else. Yeah, I think the big thing is just going to be away from noise and people, and being able to just live on my own time, and not feel-- there'll be very little input from e-mails and texts and calls, and it will be really nice to just unplug, and just feel a little bit nomadic, and, you know. For a while. And not have any sort of-- apart from-- yeah, that's what I think I'll enjoy. Everything we're doing that day is just what we're doing. We're just walking, and we're trying to get from here to 20 miles further ahead, and there are no other drags on our attention or time. Yeah. That will be really nice."
1343.0,1349.0,Interviewer,Does it also feel maybe like an adult type of thing to do?
1349.0,1381.0,Subject,"Yeah, probably. I think that will be-- I think that will-- when I complete it, that will feel like hopefully another level's been added. Because there will be challenges. There will be times that I'll want to give up, or just don't want to walk anymore. I'm sure I'll completely hate it at some points. But yeah, I'm sure there's an element of just... yeah, of growing a bit through doing that experience, which would be nice. Yeah."
1381.0,1383.0,Interviewer,You feel like it'll be a growth experience.
1383.0,1426.0,Subject,"Definitely, yeah. And I think for us individually, and I think for us as a couple. I think, in a way, that's what we've got in mind, that it will be a really good experience for us to do together. Because we're very good with handling problems, like projects, together. Because most of our relationship has been pretty much handling one big project after another, and we're actually really good at it. And I think it will be-- because we'll have been pretty much free from the paperwork, and all the-- we'll be away from that kind of thing for a while. There won't be any of those stressful projects, it will just be our project. Yeah."
1426.0,1428.0,Interviewer,So it's empowering?
1428.0,1498.0,Subject,"Yeah. Oh, it definitely will. Yeah. And it's just something that we-- all the planning, for like a year, and all the training to get there, and I think it will just be a really positive thing. Because it's been a lot of upheaval. It's been quite hard to begin a new marriage with all of this going on. Surprisingly, we've just been sitting down very recently and being like, ""Oh my goodness."" You know, most people in the new marriage, you've got your job and your house and you're pretty much set up and good to go, so you can really enjoy that time, and it's quite formative. And we've really-- it's become a little bit logistical, the relationship, I think. I imagine that'll be a very common thing. It just kind of becomes about logistics. And I think that will be-- because we'll be making this transition from New York, to then really setting up more of a married life together on the West Coast, and we'll be able to move forward much quicker with what we want to do. And the PCT will be a really good interim experience, to just solidify some things."
1498.0,1500.0,Interviewer,Make the transition?
1500.0,1503.0,Subject,Yeah. Alex calls it our honeymoon. I don't think it's going to be quite [laughter]--
1503.0,1505.0,Interviewer,You don't really [crosstalk] like that?
1505.0,1546.0,Subject,"I think ""honeymoon"" has connotations of, I don't know, sandy beaches, and mojitos, and relaxation, and it's not going to be that [laughter]. But it's going to be a real adventure, and I think a real opportunity to make some memories. Because I think-- especially with New York, it's quite difficult to get out of New York, and to do exciting things, and to go off exploring, and we don't have a car and all of that. So I think that will be a great time to just-- it'll be stuff, we'll be like, ""Oh, do you remember on the PCT when that squirrel grabbed your rucksack?"" It'll be that kind of stuff, which we don't have enough of now, I think. So, yeah."
1546.0,1555.0,Interviewer,"Having been long distance for a while, and having to deal with logistics now, right? You'll lose some opportunities to make memories."
1555.0,1584.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah, exactly. Some of that. And I hope it will-- like I said, there will be times when it's hard, but I hope it's more of a lighthearted experience. And it'll be a bit of a throwing away of everything that has happened in New York, I think. So, hopefully. And I hope it'll be like, I don't really mind, I just want to be in the forest. Most of the time, anyway. So, yeah."
1584.0,1586.0,Interviewer,Do you think you're both outdoorsy kind of people?
1586.0,1616.0,Subject,"Yes. Very much. Yeah. I think that's our natural place. I think, you know, there's lots I want to do which will include living in cities and living in busy places. But I quite happily, at the age of like 40 or 50, just retire to a hovel in Scotland somewhere, just with my chickens. So [laughter] yeah, much, much more at ease in those settings."
1616.0,1617.0,Interviewer,With the chickens.
1617.0,1638.0,Subject,"With the chickens. And maybe a couple of cats. Yeah. Than I am adept to a city. I think I'd thrive better there. Just the ability to be able to run out of your door and go somewhere. It's just space, and... yeah."
1638.0,1649.0,Interviewer,"It's not really a fair comparison so far with your time living in the city, but do you feel like-- because you've had these other challenges, do you feel like just the fact that you are in the city has made it harder to thrive a little bit?"
1649.0,1679.0,Subject,"I think so. I think this city. I do find it quite oppressive for a number of reasons, like the weather is oppressive. It's all just so-- England's just soft, and lovely, and easy, and everyone's lovely. Everyone's lovely [laughter]. Everyone here is just an asshole. I nearly got run over on Saturday [laughter]. I was so rude and abrasive."
1679.0,1680.0,Interviewer,You got run over?
1680.0,1779.0,Subject,"I nearly got run over. I was crossing, and I had right of way. So I have this joke, which I started being like, ""Hey, this is my impression of a New Yorker."" Which is like, ""I'm walking here! Hey, I'm walking here!"" And so we started all doing it, and we've all noticed how much people just cut you off, and you're like, ""I'm walking here! I'm literally a person--"" So I think New York is a terrible city [laughter]. There are some great bits about it. I don't know why anyone would live here by choice [laughter]. It's just terrible. It's April and it's still freezing. New York is one big factor, but I think a big factor included in New York is the fact that we're with housemates. And then pretty soon, we'll get our own place. And I think that will alleviate a lot of things that feel like they're all wrapped up in living in New York, which is that feeling like, ""Oh my god, I just can't get away from people, I can't get away from the noise, it's just endless."" Whereas a little space in the world that actually feels like home, and you have real ownership over, and real privacy. I think it's that. I think it's the privacy. I think it's the combination of housemates and New York, and how everyone's just in your face. And I think if you just have a space where actually you really can just call your own, and no one else is going to come through that door except me or Alex, I think that will be a very good Band-Aid on living here. So--"
1779.0,1780.0,Interviewer,So you're looking forward to that soon?
1780.0,1781.0,Subject,Yeah.
1781.0,1782.0,Interviewer,"In New York, as well?"
1782.0,1818.0,Subject,"In New York. And also it will be a different place in New York. The place in New York we live is-- everyone is obnoxious [laughter]. Just trying so hard. And I just want to live somewhere, I think-- yeah, I think there's just so many factors that actually moving out and moving to our own place somewhere, like the top of the upper west side, where it is a bit more adult, and the pace is a bit slower, and people are more polite. And all of those little things that just make your way moving through your day that bit easier, will make a big difference. Bit of privacy, please. Yeah."
1818.0,1819.0,Interviewer,Bay Ridge is like that.
1819.0,1822.0,Subject,Uh-huh? Bay Ridge [laughter]. We're talking about it.
1822.0,1827.0,Interviewer,"Okay, I think we should go ahead and stop there. Have to cut out the Bay Ridge part."
