1.0,4.0,Interviewer,So how have things been going for you today?
4.0,100.0,Subject,"Things have been going well. So I should just kind of freestyle it and just whatever comes to mind? So I'm a PhD student in Daniela [Shola?]'s lab. I actually rotated with Sophia before. Things have been going pretty well. Making progress with my thesis, chipping away at the projects that I'm involved in, hopefully wrapping up finally a project from two-and-a-half years ago when I was an RA. We'll see if that never gets done. Yeah. I think I'm improving in terms of progress, improving in terms of my efficiency and my effectiveness in lab, which are goals of mine. Getting better at being collaborative, which is something I've been trying to work on, it's like using other people when they have expertise that I don't have instead of always trying to do it on my own. Yeah, so these sorts of things are, I think, improving. What else? I just keep going [laughter]. I joined a CrossFit gym within the month. That's been pretty good. I've been relatively consistent with that. I'm trying to be more consistent with that. Hopefully, get there three times a week. I tend to talk about goals a lot, as you can tell. It's all I'm talking about. What else? Yeah, social life has been good. I've been pretty social and trying to keep a balanced life. Didn't get a lot of sleep last night, which seemed like a good idea at the time. Now it doesn't. It was fantastic. Now it's terrible. Yeah. So, but overall pretty positive, I think. Yeah."
100.0,102.0,Interviewer,And what are you focusing on for your thesis?
102.0,499.0,Subject,"So my thesis is on, in short, or in shortest, social memory. Slightly longer, it's about cognitive mapping in the social domain. Some of you are familiar with the cognitive map point of view, especially of the hippocampus. So it's the basic idea that for years, people have thought of the hippocampus in two relatively distinct ways. One camp thought of the hippocampus as encoding episodic memory and semantic facts and those sorts of things, details about the world. Another camp saw the hippocampus as a spatial navigation system, essentially. Place cells, grid cells, these sorts of things, helping animals understand and navigate their environments. And there was a point of view from the early 20th century, the 1940s or so, Edward Tolman was a big proponent, that the brain builds models, essentially, instead of just simply being an association machine. So in the '70s, when they discovered place cells and grid cells, O'Keefe, who is the first author in these papers for the most part, proposed that the hippocampus encoded cognitive maps of the environment and also maybe of abstract environments.  So we try to take that idea, essentially, the idea that the hippocampus is encoding information or elements of the world in multi-dimensional spaces and allowing you to infer trajectories and relationships between points in the multi-dimensional spaces. We're taking that idea and now applying it to social relations, how we understand our social standing relative to other people. So we have two dimensions that we probe. And the tasks we have, the two dimensions are power and affiliation. How close you feel to somebody is affiliation, and relative hierarchy, like social status, is a power. We do role-playing tasks where you interact with characters to achieve social goals. And in those interactions, you make decisions that essentially move the characters in that 2D space relative to yourself. So for example, there could be a power decision where a character asks you to do something, directs you to do something, consider that a power move. You can either act, yes, giving them some power. Or you can kind of assert some of your own power, which moves them down in power. So we make some assumptions, we built this kind of relatively simplistic model, and we can plot characters in a 2D space as trajectories in that 2D space. And then we can take those coordinates, those 2D coordinates of power and affiliation at any given time-point when we make decisions, model that with fMRI, for example. It's parametric modulators or use representational similarity analysis to look at whether the brain is respecting something about information in that 2D space.  So I'm trying to take that idea and expand upon it, do some behavioral stuff, [inaudible] of my data right now using RSA, representational similarity analysis. Yeah. I'm just trying to push that forward. Yeah. So it's a really exciting area research, I think. In general, cognitive mapping is becoming kind of a crowded field. There's a lot of people that are trying to take it and apply it to abstract spaces. So for example, there was a paper in 2016 that really caused a lot of excitement from Tim Behren's group, where, essentially, participants learned about getting arbitrary conceptual space, so two dimensions. So they wanted to associate birds with items. So in the bird's variance, they want you to [inaudible] varied upon was neck length and leg length. So for example, you can have a bird with a really short neck and really short legs. You can have a bird with a really long neck, really long legs, etc., all the combinations there are, because they vary continuously. What they did, was, they trained participants to associate birds of varying neck and leg lengths with different Christmas items. So like a Christmas tree, an ornament, [inaudible], present, whatever. So essentially, on the basis of that, then you can assign those items to a point in that 2D space of where the bird neck and leg length combination is on the 2D coordinate.  So they trained participants for several days on this task, whether they reach some kind of criterion for memory performance. Then they brought them into the scanner, and they showed them birds of varying neck and leg lengths morphing into different kinds of neck and leg lengths. So it would start at one point and then morph to another point in the space. So on the basis of that, you can define a trajectory, right, an angle, one vector length, from those two points in the 2D space, so just neck XY space. And what they showed, was that you find what they call a grid-like signal in that [inaudible] cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, these are the regions that are theoretically [inaudible] interesting in a way that you might find a grid-like signal in spatial navigation. So the idea was, this was abstract conceptual navigation taking advantage of the same kind of fundamental computations that spatial navigation does. So similar kind of idea, and there's been other kinds of papers too, a recent paper that did a similar kind of thing, looking for grid-like signals in the olfactory space, two dimensions of smells. So that was pine, banana, and you can vary those continuously. You get a smell that is a little bit of pine and a lot of banana, etc. And again, a similar thing where you put them in the scanner after they learned the space and morph those smells and create a trajectory. They also had some other manipulation too, where they had to predict the endpoint, that kind of thing and, again, find a similar kind of thing, this grid-like signal in this odor space.  So there's a lot of these emerging kind of paradigms that are similar in a lot of ways, where it's reframing problems as a multi-dimensional space and points in that space of being particular whatever, the concept, for example, or particular combination of odor. And then using trajectories to understand what kind of computations are occurring, and us understanding those spaces. So it's all the bourgeoning literature, and there's some foundation for it. There's a previous study from our lab that showed some similar kind of computation might be occurring in this task when people do it. Yeah. So we want to expend it outward, send a grid-like signal into social space but also other kinds of things. So I'm just trying to move that forward. I think it's pretty exciting and interesting and people tend to find it interesting. So, hopefully, we find something interesting people will continue to be interested in it [laughter]. And then maybe I get a good post-doc after. I might publish something."
499.0,503.0,Interviewer,"And what was it that kind of piqued your interest in this area, to begin with?"
503.0,783.0,Subject,"So I was interested in social psychology. So I guess, initially, I got-- when I first went to undergraduate-- I take you the long route since I'm supposed to just talk here [laughter]. When I first got to undergraduate, I was interested in clinical psychology and maybe being a clinical psychologist, work with troubled youth or at-risk teens, that kind of thing. And I started taking psychology classes. And I really got interested in the mind and evolution and biology, and these sorts of things were really interesting to me, kind of the core of who we are and why we do the things we do, that kind of thing. And so, I think, at the end of my undergraduate in it-- and I had worked in a lab that was kind of like social cognition focused and used EEG to kind of probe those sorts of questions, like expectancy violations, that kind of thing, but in the social domain. So at the end of my undergraduate, I was really interested in using neuroscientific tools to study those sorts of questions. How we understand other people. Why we understand other people's minds, that sort of thing. But after undergraduate, I went and worked in a lab at Yale with Hedy Kober. And for my lab, there was a bit different, it was more about emotion and emotion regulation, but in the context of drug use. So this was a craving and craving regulation kind of take on the classic emotion, emotion regulation paradigms.  So I was there for a few years, gained some fMRI skills. And I would say at that point my interest kind of changed, but I think it was just a proximity thing, this is the most recent thing I did. It seemed this would be the best thing to apply to schools for in the context of emotion or something like that. So I applied to a lot of emotion-related labs after this RA position. But also, I guess, I missed a step and went back. Maybe my second year, we went to SANS, which is Social & Affective Neuroscience Society in Brooklyn. And Daniela [Shola?], who is my PI now, spoke. And she presented on this paradigm, which was new at that time. They just collected data on it. She was presenting some of the findings. And I found it so something mind-blowing, taking something people really care about, which is our social world, which is maybe the thing we care about most, other people, and then reducing it down or understanding it from the context of fundamental neural computations and also using a naturalistic task to do it. It wasn't one of these cut and dry, boring tasks that you probably have me do [laughter], that are really trying to reduce down a highly multidimensional world into one or two dimensions. Obviously, this task does do that explicitly, but still like a narrative kind of naturalistic setting to do that. So that seemed really exciting to me. So she piqued my interest then.  But I think I kind of forgot about it. Now, when I write things for grant applications, I make this grand story of how I saw her and I knew I wanted to do that. And then I applied to Mt. Sinai, and here I am, doing it. I don't think it quite unfolded like that. I think I did find it super interesting. I was super excited by it. But I kind of forgot about it. And then I re-discovered her in some way because she did emotion and emotion regulation stuff. Because her wheelhouse and her claim to fame really was PTSD and fear memory and reconsolidation of memory, that sort of thing. And she has some big papers when she was a post-doc in that world.  So I think I was really interested in being in New York because I love New York, but also because I had a girlfriend at the time that was going to be in New York. So that was a big impetus to be here [laughter]. But also New York was relatively close to home and that kind of thing. So I think, really, I applied to Mt. Sinai-- I don't remember what the original question was. I applied to Mt. Sinai in large part because I wanted to be in New York and because it was an emotion regulation researcher doing fMRI at Mt. Sinai. And then it just so happened I got into here and I was interested in working with her. And I think, at the time, I was really focused on-- I really wanted to build methods-related skills. I wanted to improve my stats and my fMRI expertise and that kind of thing. So I think those are the most transferrable skill sets that, no matter what kind of lab you go to, if you're doing fMRI then it's going to be valuable, for instance, really deep domain-specific topic knowledge. So even when I was interested in being in a lab, it wasn't necessarily emotion regulation. So it was really just a cue to come back to something that I was initially interested in, which is social psychology. So I ended up here. I did some rotation. I rotated with Sophia and rotated with Rita Goldstein, which were really valuable rotations for me. I worked with Gail, who is a post-doc here. Gail was [inaudible]. Is she still associated with the lab? Do you know?"
783.0,784.0,Interviewer,I'm not sure.
784.0,815.0,Subject,"Okay [laughter]. So I worked with her and Dominic. I know he's left now, was a post-doc. I don't know if he got a-- I think he might have got a assistant professor position somewhere. But two talented post-docs that were really nice. We got into some projects. I was lucky enough to get on a paper. So that was a really valuable experience for me. And Rita Goldstein [inaudible] something very similar. So I had two really valuable rotations and I ended up in Daniela's lab. And I've been there now for, I guess, going on two years. Yeah, I guess, in January some time it will be two years, which is like, ""Time flies. This is crazy."""
815.0,816.0,Interviewer,It does.
816.0,845.0,Subject,"It seems less to me. Yeah. I've been chipping away at this, and I was lucky enough to write a couple perspectives, kind of review papers but with an opinion, which was valuable to me, and then be involved in some of these data-collecting initiatives and these projects that we have. And, hopefully, we'll collect some 70 of my data in the near future, kind of probing some of these questions, big online data and a bunch of stuff. So yeah. So it's very exciting. And I love Mt. Sinai. It's good to be here."
845.0,853.0,Interviewer,Yeah? And so you said you wanted to [laughter] end up in New York. What was it about New York specifically that appealed to you so much?
853.0,971.0,Subject,"I just think I'm like a high-stimulated-- I just need a high level of stimulation to be satisfied. So New York just offers that. So I wanted to be in a big city, for sure. So I only applied to big cities. I applied to schools in New York, obviously, in Miami, Chicago, Houston, and some other places. But I got into schools in those places and then, at the time, my girlfriend at the time was willing to travel and she worked at this company called McKinsey that has offices everywhere. So, potentially, she could have relocated if I had decided I really wanted to be in Houston. But I think even if she wasn't in the picture, I think, I just love New York. New York has always been kind of my favorite city. There's so much going on, so many different types of people and food and different kinds of experiences but also this proximity to home. So I'm from Virginia originally. And all those other places, Chicago, Miami, and Houston, I have to take a flight to get home. And as a Ph.D. student, how likely is that to occur multiple times in the year. Versus here, I can take a bus back. And it's not the most comfortable thing in the world, but six hours on a bus, 30 bucks, and I'm back home. And I go home probably three to five times a year. So it makes it pretty easy. So I think, yeah, it's a combination of just the local circumstance of being in a relationship and having that tug of her being there. So there was some gravity associated with that. But also just New York, in general, I just love. This is such an interesting, vibrant city and there's probably no other city in the world that's matching the uniqueness of New York. There's other big cities that have a lot going on, but there's the diversity on different dimensions is just unparalleled, I think.  And also just proximity to home. Yeah. So I think everything was pushing me up there. And I love Mt. Sinai too. I came here, it's like, ""This is fantastic."" I really felt it's a good place."
971.0,974.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And so it's lived up to those expectations?
974.0,1015.0,Subject,"Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I have really nothing to complain about. Mt. Sinai has been great. Daniela, my Ph.D. advisor, has been great. I love New York. And Mt. Sinai makes it so easy to live in New York. I think if they didn't have the student housing that was so cheap and close to lab, my experience might be slightly different. If I had to commute every day, lug my laundry to some laundromat. Those little weekly or daily annoyances would kind of maybe change my point of view a little bit. I have such a simple life but also living in this big, complex city. So I get to define what I want to be complex, what I want to be simple. And so it's really easy for me to define my own lifestyle. It's been great. Yeah."
1015.0,1024.0,Interviewer,Yeah? And you say you're always chasing stimulation or that you like stimulation [laughter].
1024.0,1025.0,Subject,[crosstalk] pathological.
1025.0,1028.0,Interviewer,"[crosstalk] to New York, would you say?"
1028.0,1029.0,Subject,What are the kind of stimulus?
1029.0,1031.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What are the areas you want stimulation?
1031.0,1052.0,Subject,"So I like to do a lot of different things. I like sports and, really, I like conversation. That's probably my favorite kind of thing to do. Just talk to people about ideas and that kind of thing is really exciting to me. So you get such an interesting set of people, especially in Manhattan. The people you bump into, I mean, I'm sure-- how long have you lived here?"
1052.0,1053.0,Interviewer,About three months.
1053.0,1134.0,Subject,"Yeah. So the people you're going to bump into are just like-- you meet all sorts of interesting people. People like actors, comedians, or whatever, into marketing, whatever. Everybody is doing something and they're motivated, they're interesting. A lot of them came here for the particular niche that New York gives you. So you get a very particular set of people that are really interesting to meet. So the people probably first and foremost. But also I love sports. New York has it all. I like art. Yeah, I like random intellectual events. There's always some talk going on, whatever. I like going somewhere and there's some randomness occurring, you just happen to be in the middle of a festival or a farmers market or whatever all the time. So I like that kind of randomness, where I don't have to pre-plan it. Things just happen. Versus where I'm from, in Virginia, it's not a small place, it's Virginia Beach, it's 600,000. And Hampton Roads is the overall area, it's probably a couple millions. So it's not a small town or anything like that. But still, to get into something exciting, you really have to think it out, plan it. Or maybe there's a couple events a year that are big. For me, any time I want to have fun, I want to have it available. And in New York, there's always something. Yeah."
1134.0,1137.0,Interviewer,"And Virginia, you found it a little too small?"
1137.0,1173.0,Subject,"Yeah. A little small. And also, when I go back, and this is somewhat of a bias because it's the people that I selected, the whatever, the environment that I'm from, but people are just stagnant. They've been doing the same things for years and haven't changed or done anything new, try new things. Versus me, I always want to try something new. I want to experience something new, think a new thought, that kind of thing. That's exciting to me. That's what life is. That's why life is interesting to me. It's because there's a lot of other things to do."
1173.0,1175.0,Interviewer,"And so, do you find that there is more like-minded people to you in New York than Virginia?"
1175.0,1189.0,Subject,"I think so. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Yeah, outgoing, stimulation driven. Maybe slightly pathological [laughter]. Yeah. So it's exciting though. Where are you coming from?"
1189.0,1190.0,Interviewer,Denver.
1190.0,1191.0,Subject,Denver? Yeah.
1191.0,1195.0,Interviewer,And you said you like sports. What kind of sports do you like in particular?
1195.0,1199.0,Subject,"So basketball, primarily. I'm a big basketball fan."
1199.0,1200.0,Interviewer,Who's your team?
1200.0,1310.0,Subject,"I don't really have a team. But I like LeBron, so I like to follow the Lakers. I also like Kawhi and stuff, all the Clippers. So I'm really interested in that development. Yeah, those are probably my two favorite guys. So I guess, those are the best players. Yeah. So yeah, I mean, I don't watch that much. I did catch a game this week. I caught the Clippers - Celtics game which is a good game, went overtime. That was exciting. My buddy bet on it and won. He bet on it. He put $50 on it. And he was going to win $300. And it was at two minutes left or a minute left in the game, and I think the-- or maybe even less than that. The Clippers had just pulled ahead. And he had bet on the Clippers. Something like they came from behind. And he was like, ""Oh, shall I cash out?"" And then, when the game ended he won an extra $50 so I can cash out now, it went 300. Then I was just like, ""We waited--"" and he said, ""It probably makes sense to cash out now."" It was an extra 50. If it was extra 200, then maybe you make a different calculation. But it didn't seem like that additional value was worth the risk. Because it was not a small probability that they could have tied it and gone overtime or whatever. But luckily, he did that. Because it did go to overtime, if he would have kept it extended, then he would have lost all his money so long. He was really excited about that. So that was cool. That made it exciting too, seeing him be happy about winning the game.  But even that, going out watching the game and there's other people watching it and you have lots of options of different bars to go to. I just like that. I don't like going to the same spot all the time and seeing the same people all the time unless I really like them [laughter]. I like people, but I like keeping a variety because they get boring pretty quickly. So, yeah. So basketball. I like boxing. Boxing is a lot of fun, like MMA, [UC?]. Football, probably less so. I'm a Steelers fan, so it's very team-driven. "
1310.0,1311.0,Interviewer,Tough time to be a Steelers fan [laughter].
1311.0,1507.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, it was really a tough time early in the season. Because they started off what? One and four or something like that, and they've kind of rallied back. So it's a pretty interesting season, especially Big Ben being injured and losing [inaudible] and Antonio Brown. It's been interesting. They definitely rallied back. The defense is really good, hasn't been really good in a lot of years. So that's fun. Because that was the Steelers football's race to power. The offense was solid. The quarterback was a game manager [inaudible] for the most part, but it was the defense that was stifling. So it's kind of cool seeing them get back to that, their really hard-nosed defensive style football. Yeah. So I guess, basketball, boxing, football. I'm not really into soccer. Just doesn't really do it for me. I just think there's probably-- probably, the thing with soccer that just doesn't capture me is just a lack of scoring. So what they should do to make me happy, is make the field smaller and make the goals bigger. And just up it. It's the same game, you're still playing, but it'll become more like a basketball-- just a foot version of basketball sometimes, I guess, is what I want. And just up the scoring.  Hockey, never really been able to get into hockey. I think it's just too-- it's hard to keep track of the puck, and it's a little too fast-paced. I like how dynamic basketball is and I like that it's fast-paced. That's what I like about it over football. Football is too structured for me. But hockey lacks it. It feels like it lacks any kind of structure. I mean, from somebody who's never played. Maybe if I had played, I'd have some intuition about it. So hockey, I think if I go to a game, I'd be into it, for sure. And I probably could get into it. If I dated a girl that was really into hockey, then I probably sit and watch a game and I learn something about it. What other major sports are there? Tennis. I could see how it could be interesting. But again, there's never really the time. I never played it. But obviously, they're incredible athletes.  What's another? What's another major sport? Baseball. That's the last one. Right? Baseball is incredibly boring to me. And I just can't [laughter]-- I can't do it. I can't watch those games. I guess, like soccer in this way. The end of the games can be really exciting because the tension, especially-- then, almost low scoring becomes an advantage. There's some other word I was looking for there. Because then it's 1:1 or 1:0, and there's been this tight game the whole time. Then they're saying, can they pull it off? And it's like every single swing and every single shot on goal is tense and exciting. Basketball, you have that too. But it's such a high pace you're likely to get a -- you always have the bounce back from another shot, another opportunity. For instance, shot on goal in soccer, I mean, how many good shots do you get on a goal really in a game? So that's where I can kind of see the benefit of having a low-scoring sport. Baseball, I can go to a game but not that interesting watching it on TV. Just haven't been able to do it. I caught a couple of the games, the world series games, because my buddy is from Houston, so he was watching it. But, yeah."
1507.0,1508.0,Interviewer,And did you play any sports growing up?
1508.0,1572.0,Subject,"Basketball. Yeah, basketball is my sport. I was competitive with it. I had a scholarship out of high school. I never ended up playing anywhere. But I took it very seriously in high school. I played it in prep school for a year. My goal with basketball-- so I really got into it end of middle school, and I really got obsessed with it and I got pretty good, going into high school. And I think at the beginning of high school-- I transitioned from a Catholic school to the public school, and then I also transitioned from being kind of, not a loner, I had friends at school, but I was into reading and drawing and playing basketball. I guess I was into hobbies. I wanted to get good at things. And then I also discovered girls and hanging out, and then everything else went to the wayside [laughter]. I tended to not do that well at school and wasn't working on my basketball skills. And then life things happened and then I had, whatever, an epiphany that led to maturity. And I decided I really want to get good at basketball and use it as a tool to get into an ivy league school. Because that was the only way I was going to be able to get into an ivy league school."
1572.0,1574.0,Interviewer,And that was the epiphany?
1574.0,1824.0,Subject,"Yeah. That I really like ideas and I really like being in that world. And for me to get into the elite world of ideas, I need to use sports now because I wasn't going to have the grades. My certificate for my grades were just mediocre. So I then got really focused again. I was 16 or so. But at that point, it's kind of late because everybody's been on the [inaudible] teams and already been scouted. People kind of know who they want. Sophomore, you're going into junior in terms of recruiting. So I got a lot better, and I did get recruited. I got recruited by Columbia, and I thought I was going to go to Columbia for a while. And then Penn was interested after I-- so I did an additional year of prep school. And Penn was interested after that. But I had a scholarship to a school, Long Island University CW post, which is a really good D2 school. And they were thinking of making the transition to D1. But I didn't really want to play D2, I wanted to play D1. I felt I was a D1 player. Also, I went there, and there was this kind of like-- it just felt really bro-y and just a kind of like a Long Island bro party school. And I was like, ""That's cool."" But what I really wanted was maybe some of that, but I really wanted to be in this world with high academics but also good sports.  So I thought, Columbia, I think at the time was okay. Harvard, they never showed any interest. But Harvard, I don't know if they were starting-- they definitely got good because my buddy from high school played at Harvard and they got pretty good. And they actually went to [inaudible] one year. And I don't know if they were good at that time. But it was mainly Penn. Penn was always historic for the good basketball team for the ivy league. They had a history of sometimes being [inaudible] or whatever, being competitive with higher-level D1 schools. But I just kind of felt their own this-- and I had a decent year in prep school but personalities and all this sort of thing. The way I prepared probably wasn't ideal. So I ended up going to William & Mary with the goal of walking on and initially got-- this really still kind of rattles me. I got promised a walk-on spot. Seems like if you get in, you're on the team. And I was definitely better than some of the guys on the team too. I was definitely better than the kid that ended up walking on [laughter]. Obviously, I would say that, but this kid wasn't good. He was not a D1 player. He was a D3 at best. He wouldn't have been able to start on most D3 teams. But anyways, but the guy ended up chipping me out of the spot or whatever. And then he's like, ""Oh well, the try-outs [inaudible]."" What do mean, the try outs? You said I was going to be on the team. Then I kind of knew something was-- yeah, that's kind of weird. And he didn't care enough necessarily to screw me over. What does it matter? I'm a walk-on. But what it turns out was, that kid was the son of the coach from an elite-- he coached an elite prep school and they were recruiting some of the kids there. So it was politics. So I get it. But don't promise me a spot on the team then.  But I think, in the long run, he probably helped me to get in because I probably didn't have the grades to get in William & Mary either. William & Mary is probably just a natural ivy league. So still, in the long run, basketball helped me get to William & Mary. Yeah. And from there, I just focused. I still played. And then I still play occasionally. Some buddies of mine that still play pro ball overseas or whatever. But then it became about academics. I think if I had played-- if I played at William & Mary-- if I'd had a degree from William & Mary, I probably would have done pretty well academically. But I probably wouldn't have volunteered in the lab. Probably wouldn't be here getting a Ph.D., so just chance and the way things unfold. But I think I'm happier with this trajectory than if I had been successful at basketball. If I had been successful at basketball, I had a very clear ceiling. I could have been a decent D1 player, I think. But not the NBA. Maybe overseas in one of these middling leagues, and make some decent money maybe, if I really maxed out my potential. I was a pretty good athlete. But then what? You play for a few years. Your whole skillset is just athletics, and then what? What do you do after? You coach? I never really wanted to be a coach. So I'm kind of glad. I think that was a good out at that time because it got me to a better school, which was kind of a goal, and I got to focus on the thing I care about, which is throwing up ideas."
