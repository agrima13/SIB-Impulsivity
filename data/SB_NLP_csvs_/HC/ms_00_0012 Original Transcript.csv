1.0,11.0,Interviewer,Okay. So we'll just pick up where we left off. So you are waiting to start work. So what is that like?
11.0,27.0,Subject," A lot of waiting because I think it's the background check and the all the HR application. I mean, they always take some time for that, so I'm just waiting for them to get done with that so I can start working."
27.0,32.0,Interviewer,And what do you find the most exciting about starting work?
32.0,51.0,Subject,"That I'll finally get to see clients and finally get to do what I really like doing, which is interacting with clients and people from different cultures and diversity. Me, coming from a different background, also, I'm very excited to meet people from different backgrounds."
51.0,54.0,Interviewer,Okay. Why do you think that [is?]?
54.0,84.0,Subject,"That's it's exciting? I feel like I get to learn a lot. And I've always liked-- I'm very social, so I like interacting with people and talking to people and being around people. So I'm excited to be around coworkers and different people and start work. I've always interned, but I've never really worked, so I'm really excited about actually working and not interning."
84.0,88.0,Interviewer,And what do you think makes it different?
88.0,101.0,Subject,"I think taking your job more seriously, people taking you more seriously, and actually putting in more efforts to work."
101.0,106.0,Interviewer,Do you think people didn't take you seriously when you were an intern?
106.0,134.0,Subject,"I mean, they did. I mean, it was great when I was an intern. But it was like, ""Oh, it's fine. You're an intern. It's okay if you don't want to do this. It's okay if you don't feel like doing this."" And I kind of got away with a lot of things, but now that's not going to be that. And I'm happy that at least I'm going to learn the hard way, which I want to do. So I am [trying to adapt to work?]."
134.0,138.0,Interviewer,And what kind of things did you get away with?
138.0,169.0,Subject,"There were times when I was completely clueless about a few things, and my supervisor was extremely nice. And she was like, ""It's fine. You know what? I'll just do it."" And if there was something that I didn't like doing at all, I used to just be like, ""I just don't feel like doing this. Is there something else that I can do?"" And she would be extremely nice [and like?], ""Oh, yeah. It's fine. I totally understand you not wanting to do this because you don't like it."" But I know that's not going to be that once I start working, so."
169.0,173.0,Interviewer,And what was that that you didn't like doing?
173.0,210.0,Subject,"A lot of times, I actually didn't like getting on calls for meetings. I mean, I wasn't allowed to say anything, so I just had to listen. And most of it was not even involving my work or something, so I would actually just waste two, three hours on a call and learn nothing. But because I was working with my supervisor and she had to be on the call, she was like, ""No. You should get on the call."" And I was like, ""Listen, I'm not really learning anything, so can I just do something [laughter] else?"" And then she'd be like, ""Yeah. Fine. I understand [laughter]."""
210.0,211.0,Interviewer,That's nice.
211.0,212.0,Subject,Yeah.
212.0,215.0,Interviewer,What kind of calls were they?
215.0,234.0,Subject,"There were a lot of projects with different groups and lots of other different organizations where we were collaborating. In fact, one of the calls I that I really enjoyed was the ProSPECT call that I was a part of."
234.0,235.0,Interviewer,Oh.
235.0,236.0,Subject,Yeah. I was a part of ProSPECT.
236.0,237.0,Interviewer,Wow.
237.0,288.0,Subject,"Yeah [laughter]. And I was on one of the most exciting projects. I always loved working with ProSPECT. So she was a research coordinator for ProSPECT. And because I was her intern, I was working on ProSPECT as well. So I used to attend the Monday calls every day at 2:00, and they used to be updates. But that was fun because the whole idea of ProSPECT was something that was very different to me because I come from India. And in India, mental health is still to be explored, and it's far, far, far, far away from people accepting it. I mean, now there is a bit of an awareness, but it's still stigmatized largely. But we heard it's much better, so I really wanted to involve myself into more mental stuff and everything. So I was a part of ProSPECT. So I know Cheryl because she used to be on the call as well [laughter]."
288.0,289.0,Interviewer,[That's right?].
289.0,291.0,Subject,Yeah. Were you on the call as well?
291.0,292.0,Interviewer,No.
292.0,293.0,Subject,No.
293.0,297.0,Interviewer,"I'm not involved in ProSPECT. I'm mostly just research, so [that's okay]."
297.0,299.0,Subject,Okay. Yeah.
299.0,302.0,Interviewer,But it's a really great program.
302.0,303.0,Subject,Yeah.
303.0,304.0,Interviewer,I'm super excited for it to start.
304.0,305.0,Subject,Yeah.
305.0,325.0,Interviewer,"Because we have so many people in the program, and it would be nice to [offer?] them treatment options and stuff. So you said in India that there's less awareness and less-- can you describe that a little bit more?"
325.0,474.0,Subject,"There's a lot of poverty in India, so most of the social work that is done in India is very grass root and more of community organization, basically, providing people with the basic needs, such as food, shelter, and clothes. And people are so poor that people literally don't have to eat every day, and they don't have shelter. And so most of the organizations are working towards, first, providing them with basic amenities, and two, education. The education level is also very low. Also, because India is highly a patriarchal society, where a lot of women are not sent to study. I mean, this is mostly in the low socioeconomic backgrounds, but that constitutes major of India's population. Obviously, there are people-- the upper middle class and the upper class is okay, but the ones below that are still very patriarchal. And they don't believe in spending money by sending their girls to school, and they only want to get the girls married off. And so a lot of organizations are working to educate women. So a lot of funding is put into education, where organizations are actually paying to educate girls so that the family doesn't have to. At least, that way, they'll send the girls to school and educate them. So mental health is the last thing that's on their mind. And if you talk to someone about mental health in India, they're just going to be like, ""We don't even have the basic-- we don't have basic things. Mental health, we don't even care about it."" I mean, ""If I don't have food to eat, obviously, my mental health is not going to be stable."" So that's their response. And then you don't know what to say to them because they're kind of right. So even among the upper middle class, now there is awareness. But then still people in India don't see therapists. And it's like even if someone does, it's not like they'll tell people about it. They'll just not tell anyone about it. And they don't want to openly see therapists because they're scared they're going to be judged and everything. And people will just be like, ""Oh, you know what? I've heard she's mad [laughter]."" That's the thing they use. So lots of problems and--"
474.0,480.0,Interviewer,And so what was it like to study? I assume you studied there before. 
480.0,481.0,Subject,Yeah.
481.0,485.0,Interviewer,So what was it like to study there in the midst of all this?
485.0,554.0,Subject,"I mean, the education that I received was very good, thanks to my parents. I mean, obviously, there was-- actually, I have not faced much discrimination because the schools we went to were really good and everything. But because I worked at the-- so I have done a Masters of Social Work from India as well. Because when I was working as a social worker in India, that's when I started seeing more of it because that's when I started mixing with people who face these problems. Because all of it was bubble, where to go to school. You mix with people of your crowd, and then that's it. And then when I started to going to social work school and when I started to feel and then when I started actually going to feel, it was a different world. It was a different world altogether. And that's when I-- I mean, there was discrimination all the time, but that was something we learned to live with."
554.0,556.0,Interviewer,Discrimination? 
556.0,604.0,Subject,"Like boys allowed to play certain sports and girls not allowed certain sports and everything and also boys being allowed to stay until late night and girls not being allowed to stay until late night. Not because your parents have a problem with you going out, but it's just that it's so unsafe sometimes that they'll just be like, ""No, it's not safe,"" and everything. So even though it did exist, we almost learned to live with it. But then once I started working with all of these people, I realized that problems are much bigger, and it was all in the grassroots level, and it was really bad."
604.0,605.0,Interviewer,Bad?
605.0,691.0,Subject,"Yeah, in terms of not just-- do you know what the informal sector is? So I worked mainly with the informal sector. So the informal sector is the sector that is not like offices. They're just the agricultural sector, then your home-based workers, and everything, basically, the ones that do not go to offices or work for proper organizations. So 96% of India's population actually works in the informal sector. They're basically women who are domestic [help?], and they're also home-based workers and agricultural workers and construction workers and everything. So a lot of these women actually used to make-- and so the crowd that I was working with, these women used to make belts for brands like H&M and Zara and everything. They used to make about 100 belts every day, and they used to work 16 hours a day. And then they used to get paid 0.000 cents or something for a belt. So basically, for making 100 belts, they would make probably 1 and a half dollar every day--"
691.0,692.0,Interviewer,Wow.
692.0,783.0,Subject,"--which was exploitation and discrimination because of the gender. And that was why they were paid so less. And they were not-- and also, these women didn't have any health benefits because they were not employed officially. So if they just took one day off, they would just lose their jobs. So they would actually sit all day and make belts and just earn 1 and a half dollars or something like that. And so what we did is we helped forming trade unions of these groups of women who did these various types of occupation so that they could actually-- and actually, there are laws in the country for them. But because they have not been formally educated, they obviously don't know about them. It's only the people who've gone to good schools and all who are aware of the laws. Otherwise, nobody knows what's going on. So we used to educate these women about their rights and the laws that have been made especially for them and also help them form trade unions. And they would have meeting every once a week. And if they have been exploited or discriminated against, they would bring it up. And then they would go to the employer as a group and speak to the employer and pressurize the employer to actually budge [inaudible] and everything. Yeah."
783.0,784.0,Interviewer,"That's really powerful, right--"
784.0,785.0,Subject,Yeah.
785.0,802.0,Interviewer,--the effect of that kind of [achieves?]. Wow. Wow [laughter]. That's so interesting. Did you ever talk to any of them individually?
802.0,803.0,Subject,Yeah.
803.0,804.0,Interviewer,What were they like?
804.0,849.0,Subject,"It was really nice. And for some reason, what I really noticed is they never saw this as problem. And if you tell them that, ""Oh, why are you doing this? Why are you working?"" And they're just like, ""Because earning something is better than earning nothing. And we're not educated enough to work jobs, so we have to do all of this. And it pays for our groceries and everything. So it's just like we earn some money and everything."" And they'll just be like-- they were so accustomed to it but didn't see there was something wrong in all of this. "
849.0,850.0,Interviewer,Do they have families?
850.0,852.0,Subject,Yes.
852.0,856.0,Interviewer,"Oh, but they only got-- there's so little time if they worked 16 hours a day."
856.0,859.0,Subject,Yeah.
859.0,879.0,Interviewer,[inaudible]. It seems like this is very politically engaged. I think social work here is a little bit less politically engaged. Do you find that there are other differences between social work here and social work there?
879.0,924.0,Subject,"I think the main thing is social work here is more of a direct practice, working with clients directly. But social work in India is not direct practice at all. It's either policy making-- you either work with the government to make policies or just working with the community as a whole. You don't work with one person. I mean, obviously, one person comes to you and they say that they have been abused by their husband, and you do take them to the hospital and then the police station and everything. But you don't work with that one client only. You're working with the whole community."
924.0,928.0,Interviewer,Wow. Which do you prefer?
928.0,933.0,Subject,"Both, actually, a little bit of both. Yeah."
933.0,940.0,Interviewer,And do you think that you will get what you have in India here?
940.0,964.0,Subject,"No. I think all the jobs that I've looked for and stuff for social workers, they don't have community practice. They have coordinator jobs, but that's also more of admin and not much of actually going to the community and working."
964.0,966.0,Interviewer,But is it something you'd still want to do?
966.0,977.0,Subject,Maybe later on because I've worked for so many years in community. I'd probably want to do some direct practice so that I have the best of both worlds. Yeah.
977.0,985.0,Interviewer,"And do you know kind of what populations you want to work with, specifically?"
985.0,996.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mainly want to work with women because I have worked with women even in India. And I really feel like I want to work with women, and I identify with working with women the most."
996.0,1000.0,Interviewer,And why do you think that is?
1000.0,1018.0,Subject,"Because I feel like no matter where we're in the world, gender discrimination is there everywhere. And I think women are treated as secondary citizens in every part of the world. And I really want to work towards uplifting and empowering women."
1018.0,1023.0,Interviewer,That's great. And how do you kind of see yourself doing that?
1023.0,1046.0,Subject,"Obviously, I want to work in the mental health field because women actually have more chances of being affected with a mental health illness as compared to men. And also, women, I think, also do not seek that much of treatment like men do."
1046.0,1047.0,Interviewer,Interesting.
1047.0,1052.0,Subject,Yeah.
1052.0,1054.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that?
1054.0,1056.0,Subject,It's research [laughter].
1056.0,1057.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1057.0,1104.0,Subject,"Because there is a lot of stigma attached, definitely, on women. And I think whenever there's stigma attached, I feel women are affected more because, as I said, they're the secondary gender. They're not given that much importance, and they feel like this is just an added burden on them because they're already facing so much. And they're like, ""Well, I'm just [learning?] about it."" If a woman is facing depression or something, she'll just be like, ""You know what? I can't and everything because I already have so much to do, and I don't want people to think that I'm going to a therapist and everything."" And so women just don't go. And they also have so much work. They'll just be like, ""I will take care of my family. I will take care of my kids. I have to drop them at the school. I have to cook food. I don't have the time,"" and everything. Yeah."
1104.0,1119.0,Interviewer,"Interesting. I didn't know that. Okay. So we've talked a lot about work. It sounds like really exciting stuff. How have you liked New York, [generally?]?"
1119.0,1122.0,Subject,"I've been here for two years now, and I love the city [laughter]."
1122.0,1124.0,Interviewer,Okay.
1124.0,1144.0,Subject,"Yeah. I really like it. Also, New York reminds me a lot of Bombay because it's a big city. And it's the city that never sleeps, and there are always people on the streets. And there's always someplace open to eat and everything, so it gives me very homely vibes, so I like it."
1144.0,1145.0,Interviewer,Okay.
1145.0,1147.0,Subject,Yeah.
1147.0,1153.0,Interviewer,So what do you like to do in New York? How does it remind you of Bombay?
1153.0,1193.0,Subject,"Firstly, because of the eating places, the fact that it has so much variety, and Bombay has a lot of variety. Then the subway is just like Bombay local trains, which I used to use a lot [laughter]. Also the fact that there are so many people here and there always people on the streets, and it's so noisy. And there's so much noise, and there's no place that's actually very quiet. I like it. I like the fact that it's not completely like, ""Oh, everything is so quiet and everything."" I don't think I can live in a city [laughter] that's very quiet."
1193.0,1195.0,Interviewer,So you've never tried.
1195.0,1198.0,Subject,"No, I've never tried [laughter]."
1198.0,1200.0,Interviewer,"I'm from New York, so I like the hustle and the [bustle?]."
1200.0,1202.0,Subject,Yeah.
1202.0,1211.0,Interviewer,Awesome. And how was it adjusting to living here?
1211.0,1252.0,Subject,"It wasn't very hard because New York is extremely diverse. And also, I came here when I started with school, so I had a lot of work anyway. So I enjoyed that. I loved the two years of school, and I wish I could go back sometime. And it wasn't hard. I mean, I did miss my parents and my sister. But I went home pretty often as well, like one where there was a whole vacation I was supposed to go back to Bombay. But I love New York. I fell in love with the city, so I didn't really feel like it was hard adjusting."
1252.0,1257.0,Interviewer,And what do you think you found so enjoyable about school?
1257.0,1292.0,Subject,"The first thing that I like about NYU was the area it was located in. That area just has a different vibe to itself. Even if you are at home and you just get out and go near NYU, you automatically feel your mood is lifted. And I have great professors. I made some amazing friends, and I liked studying there. It was very nice, and I liked going to classes and everything. The library was amazing. They had events, which were amazing."
1292.0,1293.0,Interviewer,What kind of events?
1293.0,1311.0,Subject,"They were having a lot of movie events or movie nights or international student and various events, where they would have people come and talk and everything. And it was just really good."
1311.0,1317.0,Interviewer,What do you think is your favorite memory from school?
1317.0,1348.0,Subject,"From school, I think it was the first day of school. It wasn't the first day, the first day for orientation because that's when I met everyone, and then there were amazing people who came and spoke and everything. And I made a lot of friends on the first day itself. And I clearly remember the first day of orientation and everything."
1348.0,1349.0,Interviewer,[That's?] so lovely.
1349.0,1350.0,Subject,Yeah.
1350.0,1354.0,Interviewer,And you said that you go home a lot. Are you close to your family?
1354.0,1356.0,Subject,Yeah.
1356.0,1362.0,Interviewer,How does it feel to be far apart?
1362.0,1405.0,Subject,"It's horrible. Yeah. I do miss them a lot, but they do visit often as well. So [they'll be here?] till June. Yeah. And it's been two months now. But then I went back in December, and then I went back last August. And then they were there in September and May. I mean, when they're not here, I do miss them a lot because we've always lived together back home and everything. And we're used to coming home to a family. And here, it's not like that, so it's a bit different. And it is a bit difficult, but it's fine."
1405.0,1406.0,Interviewer,And you said you had a sister.
1406.0,1407.0,Subject,Yeah.
1407.0,1409.0,Interviewer,What is she like?
1409.0,1423.0,Subject,"She's my younger sister, and she is also studying. And she's funny. She's really funny. She has a great sense of humor, too much fun to be around. And--"
1423.0,1424.0,Interviewer,[Too much?]?
1424.0,1441.0,Subject,"Yeah. She's a lot of fun to be around. And we fight like every other sibling. She's always taking my clothes and everything. And otherwise, she's great company. I like it when she's around, and we do a lot of fun stuff together. Yeah."
1441.0,1443.0,Interviewer,Like what?
1443.0,1468.0,Subject,"We go out with friends. [I tried?] both of us just go out and eat and try different restaurants, go to museums together and everything. She's also very adventurous, very ready to explore new places and everything. So that's a plus. So both of us just take off, and we're like, ""Oh, you know what? Today, we should just try this restaurant, and we should go to this museum and everything."" So it's fun."
1468.0,1472.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And she comes over with your family.
1472.0,1473.0,Subject,Yeah.
1473.0,1485.0,Interviewer,"That's great. And here, what are your friends like? What do you like to do here?"
1485.0,1533.0,Subject,"So I have a lot of friends from everywhere. Actually, I have a lot of friends from my high school in Bombay. I have a lot of school from-- I have a lot of friends from Bombay who are from my middle school, and I do have a lot from my undergrad school as well. And I have my grad school friends. So I do have a lot of friends in the city, different groups. And it's really fun to hang out with them. They're really fun. So we do different things. We also go to the museum. We go out to eat, and then we go out to drink. Sometimes we just stay in, watch a movie, and cook at home together, go to the park for a walk, or some fun stuff like that."
1533.0,1534.0,Interviewer,You mentioned a museum a couple of times.
1534.0,1536.0,Subject,Yeah [laughter].
1536.0,1539.0,Interviewer,What kind of spots do you like?
1539.0,1540.0,Subject,You mean which museum?
1540.0,1541.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm.
1541.0,1563.0,Subject,"So my favorite museum is definitely the Met. I love the Met. I've been there 100 times. Then I also love National History. It's really good. I've been to the Brooklyn Museum as well, which is good. Then I've been to quite a few museums."
1563.0,1565.0,Interviewer,What makes the Met so special?
1565.0,1586.0,Subject,"I love the fact that it has so much art from all around the world. And I also like that fact that the Met is a very fashionable museum, and it has so much on fashion. After the Met Gala, if you go, they always have their costumes on display."
1586.0,1587.0,Interviewer,"Oh, really?"
1587.0,1591.0,Subject,Yeah. So you should go [laughter].
1591.0,1592.0,Interviewer,Okay.
1592.0,1645.0,Subject,"Yeah. And it's free for New York residents. So they have camp on display because their theme is camp. So they have a lot of camp stuff on display, and it's really exciting. So yeah, that's what I like about the Met. And I like the Met that it's so inclusive of everything. I has paintings and statues and fashion. They have this one entire book on Mughal art and everything, which is so different. I have not seen stuff on Mughal art anywhere else in the world, I mean, apart from India because it's been ruled by the Mughals. I mean, the Met has it. And I was like, ""Wow."" And they have Indian, Korean, Chinese, and Arabic, and it's like, ""Wow, it's so amazing."""
1645.0,1646.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It has a lot of stuff.
1646.0,1647.0,Subject,Yeah.
1647.0,1649.0,Interviewer,Did you see the [inaudible]?
1649.0,1651.0,Subject,No.
1651.0,1652.0,Interviewer,That was a few years ago.
1652.0,1653.0,Subject,Okay.
1653.0,1695.0,Interviewer,"Oh, yeah. It might have been four years ago. It was amazing. It was like all the art that they have found displayed and [inaudible]. It was beautiful. But yeah, it's a great museum. Yeah. So it sounds like you have a really incredibly busy life [laughter]. And then you have some friends, and you're so excited about work. How do you kind of see your life changing and evolving in the future?"
1695.0,1697.0,Subject,You mean after I start working?
1697.0,1698.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm.
1698.0,1737.0,Subject,"Obviously, there'll be less time to go to museums [laughter]. Yeah. So I want to get more busy because I feel like I'm a bit too free now. And I was lazing around and sleeping in the afternoon because I have nothing else to do. Then I go to the riverside and everything for a run or something. But obviously, I'll get more busy. But I wanted to get more busy because I think I've already had fun during summer and everything. And now I just want to work and earn some money so that I can have some more fun and travel more, definitely."
1737.0,1738.0,Interviewer,"Hey, you like to travel?"
1738.0,1740.0,Subject,I like to travel.
1740.0,1742.0,Interviewer,Where do you like to travel?
1742.0,1748.0,Subject,"Where do I want to go, or where have I already been?"
1748.0,1749.0,Interviewer,Both.

1778.0,1825.0,Subject,"I don't know. It's just such a stress-- it's so de-stressing. And I also like-- also, when I travel, I actually go and visit a lot of museums. So it helps me learn about the culture and history of a country. And I also like the fact-- and also all my, in fact, vacations have been with my family.

So I really like traveling."
