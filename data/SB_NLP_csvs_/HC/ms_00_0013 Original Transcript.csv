0.0,6.0,Interviewer,"The first question I will ask is, how have things been going for you lately?"
6.0,23.0,Subject,"Pretty good. I'm enjoying my coursework. Starting to get a little hectic [inaudible] we're halfway through. I know we're closer to the final. So your last chance of improving your grade. Yeah, pretty good so far."
23.0,31.0,Interviewer,Good. And is that something that you find stressful heading towards finals?
31.0,49.0,Subject,"Not so much. Is just a lot of papers and they're all going to come, pile up at the same time. So that might get stressful in three weeks from now. That's when they're all due. So I have to start working on them one after the other."
49.0,53.0,Interviewer,And are they on subject matter you find interesting?
53.0,84.0,Subject,"All the classes require paper. I wish they all could just talk to each other and let us submit one for all three [laughter]. That's not how things are in the United States. You have to write four separate papers for four different classes. So that involves a lot of research, a lot of reading articles. And I'm trying to make it interesting, similar to my interest. But that's difficult because I'm still figuring out what my interest is."
84.0,92.0,Interviewer,So you're still figuring it out. What kinds of things are you leaning toward?
92.0,114.0,Subject,"I started off with studying borderline personality disorder. But then there's so many limitations of the research because all the older ones are done based on the previous DSM. And now we're not sure if according to the new DSM, those studies would give out the same result."
114.0,116.0,Interviewer,Because they collapse the axis.
116.0,180.0,Subject,"Yes. Yeah. So then if what I'm trying to say for my people, I'm not sure if it still holds valid. So the nature of that for one of my courses. And then it's just random. All the three papers are not related to each other at all, that one studies. So, miscarriage and mental health, because it's such a--. That's a phenomena that a lot of women all over the world experience. But essentially we don't talk so much about it. Because it just people perceive that Oh, it's not the same like losing a family member whom you spend a lot of time with. Whom you physically been in contact with. But a fetus, it's tricky because it's not in the world yet but it was somehow living. So I want to understand if it impacts an individual the same way the death of a relative or a new born would. That's one topic."
180.0,183.0,Interviewer,That's okay then. Good. 
183.0,216.0,Subject,"That's why I just went ahead with it. I wanted to study more on the men's perspective to it because, again, miscarriage is always considered women century. But a lot of times men are also involved and they sort of have to hide their emotions because that's how the society expects them to be. But they do suffer. Then the professor said, ""Don't go that route. You might just get yourself a PhD thesis otherwise [laughter]."" Yeah, we don't want to find that gap in literature."
216.0,220.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I'm sure there has not been a ton on that."
220.0,234.0,Subject,"No, not a lot. This is a second last fatherhood. I even thought of it like the topic, the running heading. But yeah, we're not going that route. So we restrict it to females."
234.0,248.0,Interviewer,I'm sure it'll still be a very worthwhile paper to write. What kind of brought you to thinking about that? That's really interesting.
248.0,313.0,Subject,"My mom, she had a lot of miscarriages, I think, five to six of them. And it was all-- every time it was due to antibodies. She had really high antibodies. So it used to essentially just kill the child, considering it to be an invader. So I was really young at that time to understand what's happening. All I knew is one day, they would just come up to me like, ""Oh, you're not having a sibling anymore."" After growing up and after reading a lot, after studying psychology, I thought, what if that does have an impact? But because we don't study about it, even doctors they're not trained to handle or even give therapy to women just to act as a buffer. Not all women who miscarry develop certain kind of disorder but it just shows that after a brief period. They all do sort of get better. But during that period if they could just find some intervention just to help them cope better because it's a big loss."
313.0,320.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you notice that in your mom that it was a really big loss.
320.0,357.0,Subject,"Yeah, she used to be upset. She used to be upset quite a lot. But then I had my great grandparents also died. So everybody was upset. I just wanted to see if it's the same level, or because we don't speak about it much because there's no possibility that it might be a disorder. It might make you more susceptible to disorders. It's never spoken about. So maybe they just keep it within them. If we were to diagnose, we might find something. But because we never do, we don't realize."
357.0,371.0,Interviewer,That's really interesting. And do you think that traditional grief counseling is not quite-- do you think it's not quite what's needed? Is it something different?
371.0,449.0,Subject,"Is something more than that because traditional grief counseling and counseling again, when you differentiate that the fetus was not even born there is no [inaudible] contact. The fetus was just growing. So how does that impact mental health? Because another studies they'd show that for a few weeks, there were men done testing about health. They had high depressive grief and all of these issues were quite high. And not enough follow up studies have been done. Because there're events like essentially when you measure, you do tend to find it high. And then you measured it for over two months. But what after that? Do you ever follow up after two to three years? Or maybe after five years when-- were they ever diagnosed with depression? Were they ever diagnosed with anxiety disorder? But does this have a role to play? Because it won't show you in two months. All these disorders take time to develop. Well, it's a long shot, let's see. I might just find no significant result at all."
449.0,453.0,Interviewer,So how are you looking at this? Are you doing kind of like a meta-analysis like [crosstalk]?
453.0,534.0,Subject,"Both. I'm looking at previous meta-analysis. I'm looking at various studies that have-- essentially a lot of studies have used different questionnaires. So they all have something in common. They all do find high depression, high anxiety, and high grief. But then all different studies, how do you generalize and how do you know? So maybe I'll try to get access to the questionnaires to see which one's more related. There were two studies that used grief questionnaires related to fetus loss, not in general but specifically to fetus loss to measure how much does that impact? For my class, we were supposed to recommend one sort of different measure that hasn't been done. So I said, ""Let's try physiological. Let's measure the saliva to see the cortisol level maybe."" That tells us something. Because questionnaires, you always have some drawbacks. It depends on the mood, depends on the background, the economic status. But saliva is something that you could measure--."
534.0,541.0,Interviewer,What do you think cortisol would show you in that context?
541.0,604.0,Subject,"It was difficult, because cortisol I read it in my class. My thesis method said that, oh, there's a physiological measurement that we could use. And there wasn't essentially much physiological thing used. So maybe there's a drawback to using that. But then I just Google a lot of things like, can cortisol determine your depressive levels? Can cortisol determine anxiety levels? And a few studies said maybe. So one particular study said that for cortisol level, it may be measured cortisol level of people suffering from grief. And of those who do not experience any of that, and it did see-- they did see a difference. So maybe the grief has something to do with it. And cortisol is easier to measure as well. If you we're to conduct this study in the real world, you can just take a saliva sample."
604.0,606.0,Interviewer,"[crosstalk] to that, yeah."
606.0,611.0,Subject,Not an hour or two long interview where people bore out.
611.0,630.0,Interviewer,"[inaudible]. Yeah, that's very interesting. Do you think that perhaps things like the research could have different results done here and maybe in India?"
630.0,691.0,Subject,"Absolutely. In India, they don't pay much attention to mental health. So even the women who themselves experience they might not even know what depression and anxiety is. And the fact that it's always a lot of families. A lot of people have that thing that get over with it, or just deal with it, it'll get better with time. They don't think that it will. So they don't pay much attention. They might not even consider this to be an important factor plus it keeps you busy. Generally they live in big families. They look after the house, they have kids. So once they get busy, they might eventually not show that many symptoms versus a lot of families who it's a nuclear family, your husband or if your partner is not even around, you might be a single mother. Yeah. This is a lot of-- yeah, it will show different results."
691.0,706.0,Interviewer,Do you think the phenomenon is the same? Do you think people actually would react differently or do you think the coping mechanisms are different?
706.0,769.0,Subject,"I assume they might be because just in India, unless you live in a nuclear family. The whole society is constructed in a way that you have a lot of emotional support. That I find it a lot of people miss. And in terms of community and even in terms of family, everything is so close knit in India that you get a lot of community social support or emotional support. Here, not so much because everybody's on their own. Unless you do have that social setting, you do have that close family members living around or even if you're that involved in the community where people will offer you support. So coping mechanism will be different. Internally, it might be the same but the external factors will be very different. And it might lead to different results. Just because based on my previous learning, I think it will be."
769.0,778.0,Interviewer,Do you think being part of a big family or being just an Indian general helped your mom when she went through this?
778.0,859.0,Subject,"Yeah. It did because I live in a joint family. So my grandparents also there, and my uncle, aunts they all live together. So it just you have somebody to share your sorrows with. You're not alone. And there are people around who will understand, or even they'll keep you involved, that you have a social circle, you have friends. And then I was also growing up at that time. So it's not that I was the first. I was the child before then. It's not that they lost their first child. And then just community involvement in general. You'll have people who would come to visit, they would come to share. And once you're in a big community you might find a lot of women who've gone through a similar experience so you can share with them. And I was too young. My mom didn't really speak about her experience because I was too young. She might have with the adults in the family which might have had as well. But she had it five times. So I do want to ask how did how did she cope? But then I don't want her to go over all of that again. So we never spoke about it. Particularly that, ""Tell me how do you feel?"""
859.0,864.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you think it's something you might talk to her about?
864.0,879.0,Subject,"I do plan to. Just when she's not worried about looking after the house, cooking for everybody, when she's in good mood. Yes, I do plan to ask, what helped you?"
879.0,884.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How do you think that conversation will go?
884.0,914.0,Subject,"I'm not really sure how to predict because since I've started studying psychology, my mom constantly thinks that I'm applying all my learning on her [laughter]. And she always says that why did I think to go into psychology. Because when I come home, I do tell them that, ""This is not the way to go about it. You should consider a different approach."" ""It's not always about this. Why does it have to come to us? Why do you lecture us all the time?"""
914.0,916.0,Interviewer,What kind of things do you lecture them about?
916.0,945.0,Subject,"Just when she is just getting furious about. So we have a lot of house help. So a lot of stress in the house is when the house help doesn't work properly. They don't perform their duties up to the bar. So then I just go up to her like, ""Listen, they're humans. You're paying them, but you can't expect them to just-- they're not your slaves. You have to understand they're humans. They might feel emotions as well. It's okay [laughter]."""
945.0,948.0,Interviewer,I don't want to hear that. Yeah.
948.0,1008.0,Subject,"Because it's a perspective that they never had to consider. Because it was just so they were raised that way. But now that all the children in the families are studying and they're studying abroad. We see there's a different way to approach. And maybe that's a little better than what they traditionally used to follow. So then we keep bringing to them like, ""It's okay."" And even just a basic thing of cleaning your house. You can clean your house like once in three days. But in India, you have to do it every day. So we go up to her like, ""You're asking me to clean."" When I used to go back home, she used to ask me to clean my room. And I said, ""Okay, I will."" But every time is to clean. Is to go back to her say, ""What am I cleaning? There's nothing. There's no dust, there's no jobs. At least let it accumulate so that when I'm cleaning it feels better that I've cleaned my room. You make me clean it all the time [laughter] and there's nothing to clean."""
1008.0,1015.0,Interviewer,That's very interesting. Why do you think it's so different in the different countries?
1015.0,1016.0,Subject,Cleaning?
1016.0,1017.0,Interviewer,"Cleaning, yeah."
1017.0,1050.0,Subject,"Yeah. Because there's no dirt here [laughter]. In India you get dirt. She's not wrong when she says that we have to clean the house daily because morning if I sweep the house once, I have to do it in the afternoon again. And when I do it I will find the dust accumulated. It's just a tropical area the way the land is. There's nothing here. Everything is so clean. And the fact that you have carpets everywhere, you don't really see dust. So it helps you feel better that, ""Oh, maybe my room is clean."""
1050.0,1051.0,Interviewer,It's not [inaudible].
1051.0,1053.0,Subject,The dust is accumulated there.
1053.0,1067.0,Interviewer,"In my carpet, I know. [inaudible]. Yeah, I guess you read it from the blue like a little more dust on things. Which part of India are you guys from?"
1067.0,1069.0,Subject,[inaudible] west.
1069.0,1075.0,Interviewer,West. And are there other things that you find very different here?
1075.0,1077.0,Subject,Come back to India?
1077.0,1078.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
1078.0,1148.0,Subject,"A lot of things. Mainly Indian colleges because all my friends went to Indian College. The whole college setting is completely different from what we have in the United States. So my friends, even in the undergrad and grad, they all had college fests, which was a big deal. Every university had a fest where if you just do three months of students just enjoying. They just have performances. They used to invite famous performers to come perform in the college. So it was essentially free marketing for them and a good relaxing for the students. And this festival, they were huge. They were a big deal. And students used to go to big companies, big businessmen, just to see if they would sponsor their fest, and all the board holdings and flyers. And it was a competition sort of between all the colleges and who gets the better performer, who gets a better artist. My best friend in his undergrad, they had a human foosball championship [laughter]--"
1148.0,1149.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my God."
1149.0,1150.0,Subject,--in the college.
1150.0,1152.0,Interviewer,What does that even mean?
1152.0,1175.0,Subject,"It was just people playacting as the foosball table. And they used to just have the rods and then used to let the-- it was just all human depiction of foosball. It was fun. I saw the videos like, ""What? You're creative."" Then you could have your own team or you could just be a part of a team and then just essentially compete,"
1175.0,1176.0,Interviewer,That sounds so fun.
1176.0,1178.0,Subject,It was. And we don't have that thing here.
1178.0,1182.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Was that during like the summer break?
1182.0,1184.0,Subject,"No, it's during the semester."
1184.0,1187.0,Interviewer,Interesting.
1187.0,1226.0,Subject,"Once you're done with all your exams, you do keep that one month in hand. And in all the clubs that on campus they also participate. They will have performances. It's amazing. So that's one thing that we're lacking here. It's not possible to do it because the quality is so huge. People are different, coming from different backgrounds. It's difficult to unite so many people. But that's one community of belongingness feel that we used to have that I felt is so different. We don't have anything of that sort here."
1226.0,1239.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It seems the larger family units and the kind of closeness of a lot of schoolmates it seems very different from here. 
1239.0,1268.0,Subject,"Yeah. And they we're all Indians, right? Essentially we're all Indian. So it's so easy to relate to them, so easy to make friends, it's easier to party because you have the same language, almost the same culture. And even if your language is not the same you do speak a common language, Hindi. So you connect better. But sure it's different because [inaudible] culture, there are so many barriers and you have to cross all of them before making friends with anybody."
1268.0,1286.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you think that-- this is a hard question to formulate. Do you think you missed out by not studying in India?
1286.0,1325.0,Subject,"A little, yes. I do feel, at least for my undergrad, I think I could have studied in India because undergrad doesn't really matter unless it's for an engineering course where you might not even get the master's. But in terms of education? No, I don't think I missed out. Because the exposure that I got here, the faculty, the learning that I got here I wouldn't have received it in India. In terms of learning? No. But in terms of exposure, growing, I do think I did."
1325.0,1329.0,Interviewer,And you mentioned earlier that you want to go back.
1329.0,1331.0,Subject,Yeah.
1331.0,1337.0,Interviewer,What kind of things go into that decision for you?
1337.0,1509.0,Subject,"For me, the basic thing, I'm keeping both the options open. Obviously, I want to go [inaudible] first before going back because I need to make some money back and I want to own some money before heading back. But my decision to still go back is simply based on the fact that we need people there. And here mental health is pretty developed. I might be one in like 100 thousands. There, I might be one in hundreds. We need more mental health professionals there. Especially after working in the field volunteering at a hospital I found out that there're so many quacks working in India. They pretend to be professionals but they're not. And people who don't know much about psychology, they fall prey to those people. Because when you are in distress, you just need to be helped. In that moment you will go to-- if you find hope anywhere, you will go to them. And you don't realize that they're exploiting your tension. This is particularly restricted to my city. So we had this one female who somehow got a certificate from-- I don't even know what Institute was that, for drug and alcohol abuse, and counseling mainly based on that. And she just started her own practice. She says that she had a few people. And then she attended various seminars where they facilitated or with awards and everything. Just because you're doing community service, and all that, she's helping a lot of people. Then she applied to a college as a college counselor. And when the existing counselor got in touch with her that, ""Let's have an interview to see what practices are you using? Is it fit for the college?"" And they just asked her like, ""What are the therapies that you use to help people who are battling alcohol abuse or addiction?"" She said, ""Oh, I ask them to meditate."" This was her therapy. She asked them to take deep breaths in, deep breaths in, take a deep breath in, get it out, think of what the life will be without alcohol. And we were all shocked. You can't do this. Because there will be people who are battling alcohol and even any drug addiction. Their [inaudible] is on the verge of being modified beyond repair. You can't ask them to meditate. This is what we found out and she's practicing."
1509.0,1512.0,Interviewer,Do you think people have stopped using drugs or they're just [crosstalk]?
1512.0,1587.0,Subject,"No, [crosstalk] the drug use is increasing. It's increasing at a very-- so Gujarat, the state where I come from, it's a rice state, you can't sell alcohol. And the hospital where I work, the de-addiction ward used to be always full because people are getting alcohol. And the alcohol that we drink in the United States is different. It's more refined. So if I get a bottle of vodka, I know the content of the alcohol. And suppose if I get [inaudible] no matter where I get it from, the content remains the same. In India, they make their own alcohol. And the way they use it is they use jaggery and they let it rot. That's how alcohol is made. But now to speed up the process, they add methanol. They add extra chemicals that makes it more lethal. It is not necessarily just safe alcohol that you're drinking. That alcohol will mess up your system. And because it's made by people, the content always changes you can't even have a study on alcohol use because the content of alcohol that I'm having today might not be the same that I'm having tomorrow. And it's sold in plastic polythene."
1587.0,1588.0,Interviewer,"Oh, God. [crosstalk] you would like."
1588.0,1602.0,Subject,"In plastic pouch that's how it's sold. And middle-class people or even the working class, for rupees 20, which is nothing which is--."
1602.0,1603.0,Interviewer,Yes. It's less than a dollar.
1603.0,1624.0,Subject,"Yes. For 20 rupees you'll get 200ml of that pouch. And if you YouTube desi daru, how it's made. Just watch videos on it. The water that we have running in the sewage, right? That water is more better than the way they create their own alcohol."
1624.0,1625.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my gosh."
1625.0,1635.0,Subject,"And people drink. They drink, they get addicted. We had one patient who died in the de-addiction ward because jaundice and then delirium."
1635.0,1646.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my gosh. Do you think being a dry state makes it worth?"
1646.0,1713.0,Subject,"It does. [inaudible] people will drink? And I wouldn't say, ""Oh, make it legal,"" because the states that have legalized alcohol, they're not doing any better. But at least there's one thing Gujarat in general a state, it's quite safe. Now, we don't know if it's because alcohol is not legal. It's not sold legally. Because people do procure alcohol, but they have to restrict drinking in their neighborhood. You can't go out and publicly drink. So essentially the public chaos that is made by a lot of drinking states, that's less, that's under control. But then again, I'm talking about a city. If you go to the village part, it is horrible, because they drink the desi daru, the locally-made alcohol. And it's unsafe there. So the battle, you can't win. The arguments still goes on. And the fact that we've always been a dry state and it's because Mahatma Gandhi was born there. So in order to celebrate--"
1713.0,1714.0,Interviewer,Honor him.
1714.0,1734.0,Subject,"--yeah, honor him, alcohol will never be legal. But even the coolest people know where the alcohol is, where it's made. But because they get cuts out of it, they make money from that. No one reports. It's all nasty. It's a very nasty political system there."
1734.0,1735.0,Interviewer,Nasty.
1735.0,1736.0,Subject,It is.
1736.0,1744.0,Interviewer,Interesting work. Beyond that? Beyond the alcohol you think is nasty?
1744.0,1753.0,Subject,"The way of functioning is bring politics, no, into everything. Pick any country, the politics is obviously bad."
1753.0,1755.0,Interviewer,Yes. That's very true.
1755.0,1776.0,Subject,"So there are few drawbacks, but there are also a few advantages of being raised there. If I were to settle here in the future, if that thing just happened somehow. And if I have kids, I will send them to India. I would have my children be raised there than here. "
1776.0,1779.0,Interviewer,Interesting. Without you?
1779.0,1783.0,Subject,"Yeah. I have big family in India, a huge family."
1783.0,1791.0,Interviewer,That's so interesting. Why do you think the childhood experience itself is better there?
1791.0,1833.0,Subject,"Yeah. The core values that you-- I'm a '90s kid. So the way I was raised was pretty different. The way we were disciplined was pretty different. And now no matter how many new theories and practices that we have that we should be more friends with your child. After a certain point you have to draw the line. You have to tell them who the parent is. Which, I think, that's the way to raise a child. You have to be strict when you-- you have to be disciplined. You have to discipline your children because they're smart. Kids are not dumb. And if you think that, they're just messing with you. They have been messing with you all this while."
1833.0,1840.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you think you couldn't model that here?
1840.0,1841.0,Subject,The whole--?
1841.0,1843.0,Interviewer,With the discipline and the--.
1843.0,1898.0,Subject,"You can. A lot of people think that in India, because it's all about you hitting your child. It's not done that ways? No, that's a stereotype. I was raised in India and my dad never hit me. It was just once when my mom got really mad, and she didn't abused me or physically abused me. You do get scolded. You do get publicly scolded which I think it is important. You can essentially replicate that the whole model here, but then you have to be very strict. See, if a child is just being-- I don't know what can we say that done here? Is being disrespectful to others. You can't just laugh and say, ""Oh, he's trying or he or she's a child."" No. That's where you have to step in. You have to tell them that this is not the way to do it."
1898.0,1904.0,Interviewer,Do you think it won't be hard to be apart from your kids though if you stayed here and sent them over?
