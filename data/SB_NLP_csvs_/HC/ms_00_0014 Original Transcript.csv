0.0,5.0,Interviewer,Okay. So I think the first thing that I'll start with is how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,23.0,Subject,"They've been going well. I just got back from fall break, so that was nice. And I went back to St. Louis and visited family, which is nice since my parents are coming to New York for Thanksgiving, so we're switching things up this year. So it was relaxing to be back home for a few days."
23.0,30.0,Interviewer,That's really nice. And they're going to be coming here for Thanksgiving. What do you think you'll do in the city?
30.0,53.0,Subject,"We'll definitely go see all the balloons. I hear they set them up in Central Park a few days before the parade, so I figure we'll see them there because I imagine the parade will be a mess. So we'll do that. We might rent a car and go to Niagara Falls because we haven't seen that yet."
53.0,54.0,Interviewer,Whoa.
54.0,79.0,Subject,"So that'd be interesting. [inaudible] a lot of driving. I think it's like seven hours or something there each way, but I figure that'd be cool to see. And yeah, I'm sure we'll see museums and probably some movies or-- we're usually kind of last-minute in planning. So I'm surprised we have this much planned at the moment, so. Yeah."
79.0,83.0,Interviewer,Very cool. Are you close with your parents?
83.0,100.0,Subject,"Yeah. Definitely. I'm the only child, so that's an added element as well as being the first in my family to go to college adds an extra layer of familiarity, I guess, since it's a new experience for all of us. So I'd say we're tight-knit."
100.0,104.0,Interviewer,And what's it like to be the first to go to college?
104.0,155.0,Subject,"I don't know. It's kind of like a-- I wouldn't necessarily call it a burden, but it's a unique experience in that you're not the only one to experience it like I mentioned. It's important for me. I thought when I was first attending college that I had a lot of resources and Columbia's been great about having a lot of advisors and different student kind of tutors available for people who aren't well-versed in what it's like to be a college student. So I find that very helpful, and then just finding a community of other people that may not be the first in their family to go to college. Or they may be the first to go to college but are just open to helping you out if you need anything and the diversity of experiences that you have. So it's been good."
155.0,159.0,Interviewer,Okay. So you feel like Columbia has been supportive?
159.0,161.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely. Right."
161.0,164.0,Interviewer,In what ways do you think they've been most supportive?
164.0,231.0,Subject,"Definitely in the administration. They have a specific sect of advisors that are for first-generation and low-income students. So they definitely understand the experiences of students and they're constantly updating different opportunities so they can stay modern in that setting. They'll have job fairs. They'll have interviews you can have with alumni. You can go meet with them and talk about your career plans and they'll set you up with other advisors, or alumni, or professors in the school who are working in that area. So it's really incredible, just the amount of resources that they have at their disposal for first-generation and low-income students as well as just their [inaudible] in helping you. So that's just been my general experience with Columbia is that there's an absurd amount of resources. It's just mainly up to you to use them to the best of your ability, so."
231.0,237.0,Interviewer,That's interesting. I think many people don't know how to use them. Yeah.
237.0,239.0,Subject,Definitely. Right.
239.0,247.0,Interviewer,That's really nice to hear that. So you think you've-- do you think you've taken advantage of a lot of them?
247.0,249.0,Subject,"I definitely do, yeah."
249.0,252.0,Interviewer,Yeah? So what do you think has been the most helpful?
252.0,300.0,Subject,"Definitely meeting with different alumni and professionals working in healthcare and entertainment, which are two industries I'm interested into varying capacities. And just seeing the afterlife of a Columbia education from alumni and professors and things has been illuminating since I was a first attending college, so obviously, it'd be a different experience for me leaving the academic setting and going into a workforce in the future. So really learning about what that path may be like for someone with my interest has been helpful. And all the administration has been really good about helping with that."
300.0,306.0,Interviewer,[Nice?]. And what kinds of things are you looking toward now that you're a senior?
306.0,332.0,Subject,"Yeah, so I just finished an application for the Fulbright Program, and so, ideally, I'll spend my next year in Spain doing public health research in teaching in high schools. And after that, the plan is to go to medical school and potentially be a academic physician working and doing research at the same time, so."
332.0,337.0,Interviewer,What kind of research interests you?
337.0,371.0,Subject,"In the past, I've done research in oncology and I found that really interesting. And I'm also looking to get some research experience in cardiology. I was very interested by physical fitness and cardiovascular diseases since that's been something that's affected my family to various degrees, and it's rapidly changing with all the different non-invasive surgeries, it seems like, so. Those are the two that are of most interest."
371.0,380.0,Interviewer,Nice. And so what brought you to kind of select Spain and the various things you'll be doing there?
380.0,463.0,Subject,"Yeah. So my mom is Hispanic, so I've got that part of my genealogy that is of interest. Her mother was from Galicia in Spain which is like the northwestern part of the continent. So, yeah, I've never been-- we've been to Mexico and Italy for my dad's side of the family, but we've never been to Spain since most of the relatives are passed away at this point. So I'm just very curious to enhance my Spanish speaking to a much more international sense rather than just local. And just gaining much more cultural relevance to see things in a much broader perspective kind of like Columbia really wants students to do, but it's hard to do that when you have your whole life surrounded in the United States. So I was really attracted to that, as well as their healthcare system is very unique in that it's entirely publicly funded, which is something that's obviously a big debate in the United States right now. So being able to see how that works and is implemented for global populations, for very local populations in Galicia is of great interest just so I can be more informed on the future of discussions in the United States."
463.0,470.0,Interviewer,Interesting. And is public health something that you're interested in beyond being a physician?
470.0,488.0,Subject,"I think so. I'm not sure what that would translate to as a career outside of, obviously, being a physician, but I'm planning on taking a public health class at Columbia next semester. And, obviously, happy to learn more about it."
488.0,516.0,Interviewer,"And what do you think-- you said your mom is Hispanic and you seem to be on this path going to Spain, how do you think-- it seems like that part of your life is a big thing. What other ways do you think that it is a forefront of your life?"
516.0,585.0,Subject,"I guess just that there's an understanding aspect of different cultures, obviously. Spanish is the second most frequently spoken language in the United States after English, so there's a huge need for understanding that capacity especially when you go to ideas of being a physician and you're working in settings that may be low-income they may be very diversified. And so any way that you can help the patient feel comfortable, whether it be speaking in their native language or just having a general association with their culture is obviously helpful. So that's an aspect of it, as well as just the romantic idea of seeing the world, and since I haven't traveled that much and been constrained by the pre-medical curriculum and all the other daily necessities for going to a place like Columbia. So having a year dedicated to not only service, obviously through the program, but also self-discovery in a sense of finding yourself in a place that is not familiar to you and trying to make the best of it."
585.0,588.0,Interviewer,Are you nervous about--?
588.0,597.0,Subject,"Not really. Mainly excited. Nerves are kind of an absence in my life for some reason, so."
597.0,602.0,Interviewer,Interesting. What makes you say that?
602.0,622.0,Subject,I don't know. I never feel nervous or stressed to a large capacity. And I've just been like that the whole way. I feel like if you just do your best things usually tend to work out. So I've had a very laid-back approach to things and this is no different.
622.0,633.0,Interviewer,Very impressive. And what brought you to medicine in the first place?
633.0,738.0,Subject,"Probably sports. I was a very active athlete all the way through high school. I had offers to play division one baseball in college but had to decline due to a very serious elbow injury. Where basically I would have to had Tommy John surgery and have 12 to 18 months of recovery or end my career. So I got into Columbia, so [inaudible] just end my career. And yeah, basically from the time when I was in early grade school, I would be frequently seeing orthopedic surgeons for various ailments whether it'd be my arm, my leg because I would play four or five sports in grade school. So really seeing how their lives worked was of interest since that was one of the only careers I saw outside of my dad who owns a small business. My mom who's a bartender, so. It just kind of-- I kind of grew up with doctors since I was so frequently seeing them. And in high school, I worked with a few different doctors just in various research capacities, so I got to see much more of their experiences. And just recently, since all this technological innovation with things like artificial intelligence being used in medical records or on MRI scans of things like that, it seems like a burgeoning field in terms of research as well. So it's kind of like the Wild West in my opinion, in terms of all the innovation that's about to take place. And it seems like a great time to join."
738.0,752.0,Interviewer,Nice. That's very impressive that you were offered division one spots. Was that disappointing at all to have to end your career?
752.0,810.0,Subject,"I mean, in a way, but I don't know. I was kind of a bad athlete in that I always wanted to use it as a vehicle. I mean, one of my high school coaches, he was kind of a philosopher in that sense, that sports were about [inaudible] yourself as an individual rather than the amount of wins or the points you score. So I kind of absorbed some of that philosophy, but also I always did kind of envision it as a stepping stone since I was always interested in academics and I wanted to-- I envisioned myself playing at a competitive level, but always valuing academics first. So the schools that I was offered by were very competitive colleges, like Columbia, and places like that. So it was always kind of a way to advance my academic life rather than be a professional athlete, so."
810.0,814.0,Interviewer,Do you still engage in athletic activities?
814.0,847.0,Subject,"I go to the gym every day. I don't play baseball anymore. I'm not part of any intramurals. The main attribute of my athletic career is I still do a lot of running. Running's a huge part of being a pitcher, which is what I was for endurance reasons and overall fitness. So I've started marathons now, so that's interesting. And yeah, so."
847.0,850.0,Interviewer,And what was it like growing up in St. Louis?
850.0,982.0,Subject,"I loved it. It's a very misunderstood place with all the news written about it, but I think it's kind of a tragic city just in its history. My grandparents moved from Italy to the United States in the early 1900s and at that point St. Louis was the largest city in the Midwest and the fifth-largest in the United States. And so it was a huge international kind of melting pot at that era when-- the early 1900s basically, it was one of the largest eras of immigration to the United States, so. There's a huge section of the city that they called The Hill, which is an Italian-American population where my grandparents settled. And so that's been kind of the root in America for my family. So we've kind of grow up in St. Louis with a sort of romantic idea of what it was back from when my grandparents arrived as this cultural melting pot. And the various political factors that led to the railways being built in Chicago versus St. Louis was a [pretty?] landmark case in the economic redistribution of wealth from St. Louis it Chicago, whereas Chicago is now like the center of the Midwest in a lot of cases and St. Louis is kind of in its shadow. So there's a little animosity between the cities in that way. But as far as my experience, I thought it was great. I mean, it's a stereotype that the Midwest is very friendly and things. I definitely think that's true compared to more coastal or more populous cities. But there's obviously a lot to learn from wherever you are, and I thought St. Louis provided a very welcoming environment where you could still succeed and achieve things that you wanted to. So I thought it was a great experience and it really taught me a lot about resilience and just being welcoming to things that are outside your comfort zone."
982.0,983.0,Interviewer,Do you have an example [inaudible]?
983.0,1038.0,Subject,"I mean, you think being in the Midwest that you'd have a lot of rural experiences and you're around farmers and all these sorts of things. But St. Louis, in itself, is this very Democratic hot-pocket of Missouri and like I said, I grew up on The Hill with this dense Italian-American population. My mom, being Hispanic, I had a lot of experiences in school with Hispanics, with other Asian-Americans and things like that since St. Louis city is kind of an international part of the Midwest as well. So it was kind of like I had a mini, I don't know, New York experience in terms of diversity. And I really [inaudible] for that, so."
1038.0,1040.0,Interviewer,And you said it taught you resilience.
1040.0,1096.0,Subject,"Right. Like you would see in the news all these things about Ferguson, and things like that, and there's a lot of-- if you look at the crime rates and things like that it's a pretty pessimistic way to view St. Louis. And so you kind of grow up with this notion that you're living in this lesser city in the United States. And so just being able to find the best in things, and really appreciate the city for what it offers, and just being able to persevere through negative [inaudible] and-- the education system is kind of hit or miss. I was lucky enough to attend a private school and get a scholarship for that. So just various factors like that just kind of make you work hard, I guess. "
1096.0,1105.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Well, that's interesting. Do you think you'd ever want to go back?"
1105.0,1135.0,Subject,"I think so. For medical school, obviously, WashU is a great academic center. I just saw they announced that they'd have-- half of their classes now are free tuitions, which is very generous. So I'd imagine I'd like to potentially do that. And as far as where I would end up living full-time, I'm not really sure. But I'd be open to living anywhere pretty much."
1135.0,1145.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, it sounds like it. What do you think gives you that ability to just kind of live anywhere?"
1145.0,1172.0,Subject,"I'm not really sure. I guess I consider myself an optimist. And I'm very averse to negativity and I'm pretty adaptable just in various settings, so. If there's opportunity in a certain city, I figure I'll be able to use that to the best of my ability and really find the best in things, I guess."
1172.0,1192.0,Interviewer,And that's a really great outlook especially as someone who's graduating and moving forward in their life. What does it feel like to potentially be living this place you've had for four years and your friends?
1192.0,1241.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, it's kind of hard to conceptualize when you think of it in a very macro scale. But I just kind of see it as a natural evolution. I don't get too, I guess, emotional about it since I don't feel like I'm really losing anything. A natural stepping stone kind of how I view high school because I still keep in touch with several of my friends from that. So I don't feel like it's goodbye, it's just more of a see you later, in a certain sense, so. Yeah. I don't know. I'm just kind of anti-cliche in a lot of ways. When these people say, ""Oh, time really flies."" I don't know. I think things move in a natural pace and-- yeah, I'm ready for the next stage, I guess."
1241.0,1249.0,Interviewer,Nice. You said you keep in touch with your friends from high school. Think you'll keep in touch with friends from college?
1249.0,1282.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely. I think even more so in that Columbia is a very self-selecting environment just by its admissions and what students are looking for, so. In high school being an athlete led to a different population then being a student at Columbia. So I think the connections and friends that I made at Columbia are even more deeply rooted in things that I'm interested in and passionate about. So I imagine there'll be much more rewarding connections in that sense."
1282.0,1287.0,Interviewer,What do you think them more rewarding? What is that kind of unifying factor?
1287.0,1348.0,Subject,"Mainly interests. Yeah, just being-- and I alluded to it earlier. But being in high school there's a lot of messing around. There's a lot of masculinity in these athletic scenarios. And students don't really understand what their goals are. They may not want to go to college. They may not want to find a major. Whereas when you get to an environment like Columbia, people are much more direct in what they want and more honest in what their goals are, and those sorts of things. So it's much easier to kind of understand people and see how they may benefit you, how you may benefit them. And I think there's a lot of maturation that goes along with that, and so you can understand people for friendships better, I guess."
1348.0,1364.0,Interviewer,That's nice. Would you say you have a close-knit group of friends or do you kind of pick and choose based on classes and things?
1364.0,1379.0,Subject,"Yeah, I'd say a close-knit group. Mainly a lot of artistic people. I've kind of veered away from a lot of the pre-medical students because they drive me crazy. They're so neurotic about grades and things--"
1379.0,1380.0,Interviewer,"That would definitely [inaudible] to you stress, yeah."
1380.0,1418.0,Subject,"Yeah, so I don't tend to-- engaging with them too much, but the artistic students, whether it's creative writing or visual arts, at Columbia they seem very interested in more societally- engaging issues. So I find that being friends with them is much more enriching than people in the pre-med community that feel like an echo chamber. So I can challenge my own opinions and views with the art students that I wouldn't be able to in-- as much as the-- in a way, I feel like as the pre-med students."
1418.0,1429.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I remember we were talking at one point and you said you were taking some sort of class in literature. Was it comparative literature or was it creative writing?
1429.0,1430.0,Subject,"Yeah, creative writing."
1430.0,1431.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1431.0,1432.0,Subject,"Yeah, that's my major, so. "
1432.0,1434.0,Interviewer,And the pre-med.
1434.0,1435.0,Subject,Right.
1435.0,1440.0,Interviewer,That's a pretty big gap between those two things.
1440.0,1473.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely intensive which is one of the reasons why the Fulbright was of interest since I could explore a study abroad, in a sense, which a lot of students, like a third of students, at Columbia do, but I didn't have the space for. So yeah, it's definitely intensive and it's something where I'm glad to have the advisors that could've guided me through the course load, in that sense. So, yeah, at this point I've finished all the pre-med requirements by my Junior year, so this year I'm just free-falling. So that's nice."
1473.0,1479.0,Interviewer,Nice. And what drew you to creative writing?
1479.0,1549.0,Subject,"It's something I've always loved and kind of honored. The ability to tell stories that reflect humanity across cultures, across languages, across geospatial time and distance. So being an avid reader growing up, I worshipped some of the great authors and Columbia is one of the best places in the world to study them. So I thought it'd be a waste if I didn't explore that. And so I loved all the classes. They are 14-people seminars, for the most part. And the students are engaging, the professors are terrific. And it's just a really interesting way to see the humanity in people, and I think that's also something that connects very strongly with medicine in a way that the most important things aren't if you know the right drug, but it's how you treat the patient, how you treat the family, if you understand and have sympathy for what they're going through. And I think that's all what creative writing about. So I think it should be a requirement for medical students, and I think that it's very valuable."
1549.0,1561.0,Interviewer,Okay. I think that would be a very good addition to the pre-med curriculum. So what kinds of things have you been producing?
1561.0,1599.0,Subject,"Lately, I've been doing a lot of poetry, since I've taken a few poetry classes lately. Other than that, I'm working on a screenplay with a friend who's in the film department. So that'll be interesting. Don't know how that'll turn out. And yeah, that's it for the most part. I've been reading a lot of Shakespeare for one of the classes, so that's been fun to see some of the cultural elements of his time that are similar to today with a lot of hypocrisy and political instability and things like that, so. Yeah."
1599.0,1604.0,Interviewer,Very interesting. What is the screenplay-- am I allowed to ask about the screenplay [laughter]?
1604.0,1615.0,Subject,"It's like a high school drama, so. I mean, it's very much in broad strokes at this point, so there's nothing interesting to divulge."
1615.0,1617.0,Interviewer,So you're not drafting the next [inaudible]?
1617.0,1620.0,Subject,"No, no. No, not yet."
1620.0,1641.0,Interviewer,"That's something I really [inaudible], the Columbia scene, is all the performing arts at the end of the semester. That's very cool, though. I think that sounds like a really exciting-- do you think you'll get to do anything in Spain that's a little bit more on the creative writing side or is it pretty much [inaudible]?"
1641.0,1679.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's mainly healthcare-related, which I'm fine with. I'm always interested in writing based on your experiences, so being able to speak with locals and hear what their life is like I imagine would be inspiring for writing about any sort of topics. So there's a lot of [inaudible] situations, obviously, with Spain and the United States in terms of how people live, so I imagine it-- I don't need to study it in the sense. Whereas I can just absorb stories, so to speak, from people in Spain."
1679.0,1688.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And how do you see yourself continuing to do that past academia?
1688.0,1750.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm still trying to increase my count of poems, possibly get those published. And I kind of idealize myself as a future Michael Crichton who wrote the Jurassic Park series. He was a physician as well. So being able to bridge the science and technology divide between popular society is important whether it's through a screenplay or a novel or poetry, whatever medium. I think it's important since understanding one another is such a divisive term in these politically-charged times. So yeah, I think it's just something that I've inherently interested in. I imagine I'll continue to write and see different avenues of expression whether a doctor or a janitor. It's just something that I like to do."
1750.0,1759.0,Interviewer,What do you think is the benefit of bringing that science and technology to the general public?
1759.0,1827.0,Subject,"I think it's just the framework in which you view the world. In many fields, judgment is based on opinion. It's matter, fact, and instantaneous. Whereas in science, things are based on reason. They're based on experimental methods, and it's something that can be proven or disproven. And so the analytical mindset, I think, can apply to any amount of scenarios in the real world and that's what science is so valuable for. So if you could instill that in a population, whether it's political decisions or environmental decisions or business decisions, and the public had a kind of cultural fluency with how to look at things, I think it would vastly improve society. And I think that's what literature does. I think that's what good scientific reports do. So it's not like it's an inherently scientific issue, it's just a way of looking at things in a [inaudible] fashion which I think is powerful."
