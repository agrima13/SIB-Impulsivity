0.0,7.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Okay. So the first thing I'll ask you is how have things been going for you lately?
7.0,20.0,Subject,Pretty well considering that break has started. I actually just recently had a group relations conference this past weekend. Sorry--
20.0,21.0,Interviewer,You're all right.
21.0,57.0,Subject,"--which was quite intense. I'm taking the group dynamics course, so you're going to have a choice between going for the conference, which is very emotionally charged, or writing a 15-page paper, which I wasn't going to do. So yeah, I mean, that was a little taxing, but I didn't have a lot of things due after, basically in the past couple of days, so it was fine."
57.0,60.0,Interviewer,What do you mean by emotionally charged?
60.0,140.0,Subject,"Oh, so when we took the course, and then I spoke to seniors and the professor, and they basically kind of warned us that if you are not feeling well, if you're kind of struggling with stuff, they don't recommend taking the conference, because it's just like a lot of unconscious stuff comes out. And it was an interesting experience, and it's like one of those experiences where I definitely felt things, but I don't know what the learning art of it is. So yeah, emotionally charged as in there was a lot of people who had polarized opinions, and when I was taking my [inaudible] ended up in a large group discussion, it ended up hurting someone or the other, right? And it was also just mentally exhausting because you end up spending 10 hours for three days just kind of sitting and talking to people."
140.0,141.0,Interviewer,10 hours a day?
141.0,154.0,Subject,"Yeah, so it was like 9:00 to 7:45, Friday, Saturday, and then 9:00 to 5:15 on Sunday. So it was really long, yeah."
154.0,157.0,Interviewer,What kinds of things were you talking about?
157.0,253.0,Subject,"So it's like nothing because the task is basically kind of understanding what you bring to the group and understanding your intrapersonal effect on the group in the group relations and then group-as-a-whole relations. That's the overarching task, but people are divided into small groups of 8 people where you talk more about what's happening in that small group. Then the large group, which was like 70 people, whoever had signed up for the conference, they all are sitting in a room and just-- there's prolonged silence, and then someone brings something up, and then there's a rebuttal from someone else, and then there's just-- I don't know. It kind of started off with a lot of silence and then just kind of built up to a lot of rage by the end of the third day and for no particular reason because there are consultants as well, but there's nothing really that you were supposed to do, per se. There wasn't a task that you were-- or there wasn't an active or a concrete task you were working on. It was all very unconscious tasks."
253.0,259.0,Interviewer,So what was the overall purpose of the conference?
259.0,303.0,Subject,"To experience group relations. It was like an experiential sort of conference for all the concepts that we had learned throughout the semester. So you would learn about scapegoating and projective identification and all these concepts, and then in the conference you would kind of see that happen and recognize it and recognize how you play a part in it, recognize how group plays a part in it and what's projected, what's not, those kind of things, yeah."
303.0,308.0,Interviewer,"And you said that the end of the third day, there was a lot of rage."
308.0,404.0,Subject,"Yeah, rage in the sense that there was a lot more arguments, a lot more anger that came out. For instance, one of the topics that we were talking about is black and white relationship. And there was conversation about black power, and then there was this sort of undertone of that the conversation between black and white has been discussed, and it's familiar, and it's something that we're aware of, so those are more things that we're kind of comfortable with. But addressing other identities like sexuality or people's religion, which aren't very visible identities sometimes, are not discussed, because they're uncomfortable. So sometimes a topic like that would come up, and then people would feel things about it, feel strongly about it, and would voice their opinion. But then it'll get shut down, and something else will start, so that was kind of something that came up during the conference that people are usually in this group were comfortable with superficial conversations, because going underneath and discussing things that were probably not something that they're ready to do was difficult. Yeah."
404.0,413.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What kinds of things make you feel whatever it is you felt? Rage--
413.0,691.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I actually ended up having a couple of experiences, and I'm still trying to understand, and I think what they say is that you keep unpacking the conference even months later, so I'm hoping to talk to people and see if something interesting comes up. But two experiences that I had in the conference that I feel like I need to reflect upon is on the second day, we had this organization event where we were supposed to divide ourselves into groups, on your own, okay? So 70 people are deciding to kind of group themselves into six groups or seven groups or something like that. And so I kind of decided that maybe I'm going to try to meet new people and just go join a group where I don't know these people. So I saw this chart paper where there was someone writing names, and I saw those names, and I was like, ""I don't know any of these people, any of these names, so I'm going to go join this group and see how that goes."" And so I wrote my name on that one, and then I went to the room. And they all seemed to kind of know each other, and I was the only visibly colored woman there or woman of color there. And I'd read the description about the task that we were supposed to do. It was a five-hour sort of block of time where we were supposed to do a particular task, and people once-- they didn't seem interested in trying to do the task. And then this person talked about her experience of a smaller group where she felt that she was kind of cut off from the group or that she didn't connect with the group, and she was kind of pissed about that and seemed like, ""Oh, this conference is [inaudible]. I don't really want to participate."" And she kind of talked about this experience where a black man kind of shared that they felt the need to dress up and come to the conference because of the way they would be judged about it if they didn't. And this girl, who was not feeling very welcomed, said that she didn't resonate with that because she would treat anyone the same way irrespective of how they're dressed up, how they looked, and all of that. And I was kind of trying to have a conversation with her about how this could be like a consciously yes, but maybe unconsciously there are things that she's projecting, or maybe this person has come with their own experience that might be making them-- that might be making them feel this way, right? And she didn't want to listen, and then it so ended up happening that I got kind of cut off from the group, and yeah, it was a little weird situation for me there. And then I ended up going to different groups after that, and I think that made me feel a little sad. So the next day, when we were talking about identities and we were talking about-- in the larger group when we were talking about identities that are not given space, I think it kind of came up for me because I had some other friends who said some points in the large group, and those just got rushed, brushed under the carpet. They weren't discussed, or they were interrupted, and I felt like-- and not coincidentally, they both were actually international students, and I just felt like I think I need to-- I don't know. I just felt kind of compelled to kind of talk about it, and so I did, and I talked. And then I had a heated discussion with one of the guys, and this is like 70 people sitting in a room, and the two of us are talking, which was-- yeah, which was intense. But yeah, I guess it is what it is. It happened, and then after the thing got over, I tried to put my points forward. He tried to put his points forward."
691.0,695.0,Interviewer,What do you think was the disconnect between your point?
695.0,781.0,Subject,"His idea was about how people when usually talk about-- black people, when they're empowered, are usually shut down and said that, oh, but there's other things. For example, when Black Lives Matter started, people came up with All Lives Matter and not give that space to black power. And then someone else brought up a point about it's-- so the idea in the group is not just to talk about and give space to one identity. What we're trying to do is kind of have space for all other identities as well. So not saying that this is not an important issue. Just saying that there are also other issues to be discussed, and I think that's what we were trying to have a conversation about, and I think he felt like I was trying to personally attack him, and I was trying to talk to him about-- I'm trying to talk on the identity level or community level. And I mean, I spoke to him after as well, and in general, he was quite vocal in that particular large group, so we spoke later and sorted it out and hugged it out, and it was fine, yeah."
781.0,785.0,Interviewer,"Oh, [inaudible]."
785.0,796.0,Subject,"But yeah, I don't know. It's like weird things happen. It's like an interesting conference though. I mean, definitely recommend the experience, yeah."
796.0,797.0,Interviewer,"It sounds powerful, yeah."
797.0,800.0,Subject,"Yeah, I don't know."
800.0,810.0,Interviewer,"Well, yeah, I mean, do you think you'll-- do you think it's something that you'll kind of carry with you?"
810.0,872.0,Subject,"Yes and no, okay? So it's still very disconnected for me because I'm not able to understand how to interpret what happened. What can I learn from it? I still don't know that. And so it's got that feeling of, okay, I went to this three-day conference. What am I getting out of it? That being said, I am also giving it time because the people basically say that it takes time for that learning to come. So I guess it would be something that will not go away for the long time, yeah, but not in a bad way, but I think maybe just something that you will learn from with time, so."
872.0,880.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, it sounds like something like that. I can't imagine doing that for that many hours."
880.0,890.0,Subject,"Yeah, it was long. It was like at the end of the day, I would be so exhausted that I'd just watch Friends and sleep, yeah."
890.0,906.0,Interviewer,That's [inaudible] the best. And so this feels like a part of your program. That's so interesting. Why do you think that they would send you to such a conference? Is it just the group dynamic?
906.0,958.0,Subject,"Yeah, and in fact, this conference is like a-- so students get the first priority so they can sign up, and some students can decide to do the self-study project, which is that 15-page paper. Once the student sign-up is over, it's open for general public as well, so there were a lot of people who weren't students, who'd never done this course, and were taking the conference. This was like their third conference, so there were people like that as well. I think it's just kind of what people say is that they learn a lot about themselves through this conference, so maybe there was part of your experience group dynamics but also your learn about yourself."
958.0,973.0,Interviewer,Many of those stories that you told me have been about your interactions with other people. As of right now I know you're still unpacking a lot of it. Do you think that there was anything you learned about yourself?
973.0,1072.0,Subject,"One thing that's kind of coming to my mind is that I remember making this comment when we were learning about this concept of line dancing/skateboarding, and it was basically like the scenario where people are standing in line to get to security check-- to go to the security check-in at the airport. And it's a long line, and people are getting restless, and so this one woman-- everyone in the line is getting restless, and this one woman ends up talking about it or saying something out loud. And a lot of people around her agree, and like, ""No,"" and then say-- maybe don't say out loud, but think that, ""Oh, yeah, that was a good thing to say,"" or like, ""Oh, yeah, thank God she said that,"" kind of a thing. And when we were having the discussion in class, I said one of the things people might be thinking, ""Oh, she's that person,"" right, the one who talks or the one who-- the one who talks or the one who [inaudible], I guess, in some way. And then now I'm recognizing that I am that person, and that's kind of like trying to make sense of why that is, and I don't know. I don't have an answer, so."
1072.0,1075.0,Interviewer,Interesting. How do you feel about that?
1075.0,1125.0,Subject,"But that would be-- I'm not sure. I think it's more of what I-- because when I think about it objectively, I would say, ""Okay. I can see how I would judge that,"" but at the same time, in that moment when I was talking, I felt like that was important for me to do, and I don't regret it even one bit. So I think it's just kind of interesting to think that maybe it's more what I think but what I genuinely feel or maybe a difference between that. I don't know."
1125.0,1127.0,Interviewer,"Well, I'm sure you will."
1127.0,1133.0,Subject,"Yeah? I'm going to talk to my professor and my TA about this countless times, I'm sure."
1133.0,1153.0,Interviewer,"Okay. Well, it's good that you have the space to do that with them. You said when you first joined this group of people that you had never met, that you were the only woman of color. What was that like?"
1153.0,1219.0,Subject,"I think it was very uncomfortable because initially, I was like, ""Oh, this is there, but I think we can work."" But then as time went on, I started feeling uncomfortable because maybe not just because of my identity but because they all kind of knew each other. They were all from school of psych, and I did not have that connection with them, or also their idea of the conference was just to not do the work and not participate and kind of get through it, and my idea was that I want to get something out of it, so there was that disconnect as well. So I think on a lot of levels there was disconnect which increased the feeling of alienation, but I think another sort of data point on that was me being different looking as well, yeah."
1219.0,1221.0,Interviewer,Does that happen to you a lot?
1221.0,1283.0,Subject,"I mean, I'm aware of it, especially in the US, but don't feel like I'm alienated a lot, no. So I feel like because we-- especially in my experience in the US has been in a school setting, mostly. People have been welcoming. There are other international students as well, and usually there has been a response of, ""Let's learn from each other,"" so there's not usually this feeling of, oh, difference. That being said, I do recognize that I'm not going to interpret it the way everyone does, so that's just something I'm kind of-- I kind of accept it as well."
1283.0,1291.0,Interviewer,Do you think that-- or how do you also feel about being an international student?
1291.0,1399.0,Subject,"Yeah. This is another thing I learned in the conference that I do seem to still be living back home and still having just-- or thinking that my only meaningful sort of connection is back home and not putting that effort to build that connection here. And this is more like my master's experience, because in undergrad I have friends who are Americans, who are internationals, who are Indian, non-Indian, all of that, right? And my hypothesis on that is that I think in undergrad, we all kind of come out of our homes and come to a new place, and in that environment where we're all looking to make friends versus in a master's program there's that-- we already have a life, and we're here for a very particular purpose and kind of looking to achieve that and not so much make connections, make friends, make that sort of a thing. I feel that does make a difference in my experience because I can't help but compare my experience in master's and undergrad. That being said, I also don't put a lot of effort. I see myself not putting a lot of effort now, which is something I should work on."
1399.0,1411.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, and you said that most of your meaningful connections are at home. What does that feel like?"
1411.0,1488.0,Subject,"It feels sad sometimes, yeah. I mean, okay. Again, I'm going to compare undergrad and master's. I feel less homesick now because I know what to expect, and I've had that sort of time to stay away from family and that sort of a thing and had the opportunity to go back, live with them again, and know what that feels like. So yeah, I feel less homesick. That being said, it's still lonely if you don't have friends to talk to on a regular basis. So I think I'm doing better with that because I have made a lot of friends, but they're all Indians, so that's also a thing. I'm not diversifying myself, so I mean, I know if I feel sad or if I feel like hanging out or something, I can call up three, four people, but yeah. I don't know."
1488.0,1493.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, do you think you'll go back home?"
1493.0,1496.0,Subject,"Like in the long term, or--?"
1496.0,1497.0,Interviewer,Mm-hmm.
1497.0,1517.0,Subject,"Okay. Yeah, I think once my master's is done, I think I'm going to do my OPT period and then either move back home or move to a different country just to explore different thing, I think, yeah."
1517.0,1522.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you have one in mind?
1522.0,1529.0,Subject,"So my partner lives in Amsterdam in Netherlands, so--"
1529.0,1530.0,Interviewer,That's far.
1530.0,1545.0,Subject,"Yeah, it is, so I mean, that's definitely in the back of my mind to kind of move closer to him, but we'll see. I don't know."
1545.0,1550.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, what's that like, being so far apart?"
1550.0,1590.0,Subject,"So weirdly we've always been in a long-distance because we started dating when I was in Delhi, and he's been working in Amsterdam for, I think, a few years now, so he came for a vacation, and then I was there, and we kind of connected. And then he went back, so it's almost always been a long-distance, and he keeps visiting. But yeah, I think it works out. I don't know how, but it does, so yeah."
1590.0,1595.0,Interviewer,What kind of things do you think make it work?
1595.0,1672.0,Subject,"I think the fact that we talk regularly, and definitely when I moved here, there was as lot of turmoil because there was-- need your time to find a schedule, and the timings are so different, and he just recently went through a surgery, so it's a little difficult, but I think now we've kind of come to that phase of happy times. And what makes it work? I don't know. I think just kind of talking. I feel like we talk. We do Google Hangouts and watch shows together, and yeah, talk about, well, what was happening in my life with studying, and his work is also having a lot of changes. He's basically a cofounder in a start-up, so there's a lot of changes happening in his workplace as well. So yeah, there's a lot to talk about. I don't know."
1672.0,1682.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, it sounds like. What do you think made you guys connect first?"
1682.0,1753.0,Subject,"I think we were both-- there's a good amount of similarity and differences, because we're both homebodies and don't care too much for drinking or anything like that or going out and partying and that sort of a thing and like to chill at home, watch stuff, that sort of a thing. And so I think that we were similar in that sense but also different in the way that he's-- I don't know. I think he's very emotionally a child, and I am the mother in that sense, and it's like I keep poking him in that, and sometimes he appreciates it; sometimes he appreciates it later. So I think there is a way for us to kind of challenge each other as well, yeah."
1753.0,1760.0,Interviewer,Challenge each other. That's interesting. What ways does he challenge you?
