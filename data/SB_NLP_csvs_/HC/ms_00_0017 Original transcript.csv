0.0,7.0,Interviewer,Okay. So the first question I will ask is just how have things been going for you lately?
7.0,9.0,Subject,It's been pretty good. Normal.
9.0,10.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
10.0,14.0,Subject,"Yeah, nothing too different."
14.0,17.0,Interviewer,So what's normal like?
17.0,25.0,Subject,"For this gap semester, I've just been working and hanging out, and that's it. [laughter] Not that much."
25.0,28.0,Interviewer,What's work?
28.0,38.0,Subject,I worked at a prep place and a beauty store part time for both.
38.0,40.0,Interviewer,What did you do there?
40.0,41.0,Subject,Hmm?
41.0,42.0,Interviewer,What did you do there?
42.0,65.0,Subject,"Oh. The prep place was really chill. I just graded papers. And a lot of my friends are working there. It was a very relaxed place as long as we got our work done. The beauty store, everyone's nice there. It's also pretty chill. It's just like helping customers, restocking. That's it, really."
65.0,70.0,Interviewer,And how did you come to work at both of these places?
70.0,99.0,Subject,"The beauty store, I needed a job for the gap semester for college. So I was just walking around and I just saw it, the hiring sign. So I went in applied, and they got back to me. The prep place, actually, one of my friends asked me like, ""Oh, are you okay with helping for the last few weeks?"" Because someone else they had quit and they didn’t have enough people, so I decided to help. Yeah."
99.0,103.0,Interviewer,And so you're on a gap semester.
103.0,104.0,Subject,Yeah.
104.0,107.0,Interviewer,What made you decide to do that?
107.0,126.0,Subject,"If I went to that school, I could only-- I had to take the gap semester. But because of the gap semester, I'll also get to go explore London in the summer for study abroad. So it's cool."
126.0,132.0,Interviewer,"Sorry, can you walk me through a little bit what that means? So you--"
132.0,142.0,Subject,"The program is set up so that we start in spring semester, and then we go to study abroad in London in the summer semester."
142.0,143.0,Interviewer,Of your first year?
143.0,144.0,Subject,"Yeah, first year."
144.0,153.0,Interviewer,Wow. And what are you expecting?
153.0,173.0,Subject,"I'm not sure. We're going to have to cook for ourself. Yeah. Because there's not a dining hall there. But we do live in a really nice area. But then, the currency exchange is also a lot higher there, so it's all expensive."
173.0,179.0,Interviewer,So what made you choose this program?
179.0,183.0,Subject,It was because this was the cheapest school for me. [laughter]
183.0,184.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
184.0,185.0,Subject,Yeah.
185.0,192.0,Interviewer,And so why don't you describe to me a little bit more what the program is and what you're excited for and how are you doing?
192.0,234.0,Subject,"It's just like a two-year program. And then after this, we get to choose one of the actual schools they have. We could transfer. So we get two years to decide where we want to go or what we want to do for our major. And we also get credits that we have credits, specifically, classes that we need to get out of the way first. And it's also a lot smaller, I guess, but we're also integrated in the bigger part of the school. So it's different than usual, I guess."
234.0,248.0,Interviewer,That sounds fine. So you have these two years to explore before you decide. How do you think you'll use those two years to explore?
248.0,270.0,Subject,"I'm going to start taking some classes like chem and bio for now and just see if I actually want to do it. Because some actual schools have required things that you need to take, like language. So I guess I just have to see how I like it. But I'm not sure yet."
270.0,276.0,Interviewer,And so what's drawing you to chem and bio?
276.0,294.0,Subject,"Pre-med. Yeah. I've been interested in it, but at the same time, I'm not completely sure that that's what I actually have interest in. So I'll just see how I do in both classes, I guess."
294.0,299.0,Interviewer,And why do you think you are interested in it?
299.0,325.0,Subject,"It's just something I kind of grew up around. My dad, back in China, he was working as a doctor. And then, it's just I'm-- I guess it's something I've been thinking about for so long, but I'm not actually sure what's the actual experience and how I'd feel about it."
325.0,333.0,Interviewer,And so you said your dad worked as a doctor. Is that something that inspired you [crosstalk]?
333.0,336.0,Subject,"Oh, when I was younger, yeah."
336.0,337.0,Interviewer,Are you guys close?
337.0,344.0,Subject,"We're okay, yeah. We're pretty close."
344.0,348.0,Interviewer,What does that mean?
348.0,350.0,Subject,What do you mean?
350.0,354.0,Interviewer,What kind of things do you do together?
354.0,367.0,Subject,"We don't really go-- my family doesn’t really do going out, like events. But we do eat out and stay home and just watch TV and stuff."
367.0,373.0,Interviewer,[Done?]. And are they here with you?
373.0,374.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
374.0,383.0,Interviewer,And do you see them a lot now that you're on your gap semester before you're starting college?
383.0,384.0,Subject,"Yeah, I'm still living at home right now."
384.0,385.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
385.0,386.0,Subject,Yeah.
386.0,389.0,Interviewer,And is that something you enjoy?
389.0,392.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's pretty nice."
392.0,400.0,Interviewer,So what other kinds of things are you doing? You said you're kind of hanging out and then just into working. So what does hanging out look like?
400.0,414.0,Subject,"Not that much. Just eating out, talking with friends, shopping, eating more, karaoke--"
414.0,415.0,Interviewer,That sounds fun.
415.0,417.0,Subject,--basic stuff.
417.0,425.0,Interviewer,And what is your favorite?
425.0,428.0,Subject,Eating. [laughter]
428.0,430.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that is?
430.0,438.0,Subject,"There's so many new stores opening, and I just want to try everything."
438.0,441.0,Interviewer,Is food something that's important to you?
441.0,442.0,Subject,I like good food.
442.0,443.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
443.0,444.0,Subject,Yeah.
444.0,446.0,Interviewer,Do you cook?
446.0,452.0,Subject,"I need to learn how, but I'm not that good right now."
452.0,471.0,Interviewer,"So you said you're going to have to be cooking for yourself when you're in London. It sounds like that's going to be a really big kind of step for you when you're going to be on your own. What kinds of things are you expecting, excited about, nervous about?"
471.0,486.0,Subject,"Just living with people my age, I guess, because I'm a only child. That'd be really different. And sharing a room with someone. And just having more freedom, I guess."
486.0,487.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
487.0,488.0,Subject,Yeah.
488.0,493.0,Interviewer,What do you think you'll do with that freedom?
493.0,505.0,Subject,"I guess more. [laughter] I'm not sure. No more curfew, at least."
505.0,508.0,Interviewer,Do you have a curfew now?
508.0,515.0,Subject,"Kind of, but it's more like they're always calling me to tell me like, ""Why are you still out? Go home."""
515.0,516.0,Interviewer,Your parents?
516.0,519.0,Subject,Yeah.
519.0,523.0,Interviewer,And you said you're an only child.
523.0,524.0,Subject,Yeah.
524.0,527.0,Interviewer,What was it like to grow up as an only child?
527.0,535.0,Subject,"It was kind of boring, honestly."
535.0,536.0,Interviewer,Boring?
536.0,558.0,Subject,"Yeah. [laughter] All of my friends have siblings. They could just call them and be like, ""Oh, can you open the door?"" like, ""Oh, can you bring food home?"" or something. And, I don't know, it seemed kind of nice, or just hanging out with them."
558.0,562.0,Interviewer,And do you wish you've got [inaudible]?
562.0,564.0,Subject,Yeah. Definitely.
564.0,569.0,Interviewer,Definitely. Why do you think that is?
569.0,573.0,Subject,I just know it's fine.
573.0,577.0,Interviewer,But it sounds like you have friends that you hang out with?
577.0,578.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
578.0,583.0,Interviewer,Are they coming to London with you?
583.0,585.0,Subject,"Oh, they go to different schools."
585.0,587.0,Interviewer,So what is it going to be like to be apart from them?
587.0,613.0,Subject,"It's okay. It's like I don't really-- because right now, some of them already attend different schools. I see them over break, but it's not like it'll be really bad for me to be apart for a while. Yeah. I'm still good. [laughter]"
613.0,619.0,Interviewer,And do you know anybody in your new program?
619.0,620.0,Subject,"Yeah, I know a few people."
620.0,622.0,Interviewer,Yeah? How did you meet them?
622.0,629.0,Subject,Online. [laughter] Mutual friends. Yeah.
629.0,659.0,Interviewer,"So I want to get kind of a sense of what your everyday life is like. So we talked a little bit about that, but let's talk a little bit about maybe your childhood or your hopes and dreams for the future. So let's just kind of dive in a little bit to one of those. So we can start with what you expect to happen in school and after school."
659.0,673.0,Subject,"It's pretty basic. It's just good grades, good job, money. That's all for now. It's not like I've been thinking too deeply into it yet."
673.0,679.0,Interviewer,"And so you're starting college, so it's going to be kind of a new thing."
679.0,681.0,Subject,Yeah. [laughter]
681.0,687.0,Interviewer,So what do you think you're the most excited for and the most nervous for?
687.0,704.0,Subject,"I'm not excited for the sharing bathrooms with the entire hall. I want my own bathroom in a suite, but that's not [inaudible]. I am excited to be living with someone else my age."
704.0,712.0,Interviewer,So what do you think makes you nervous about sharing a space like that?
712.0,715.0,Subject,I'm honestly not nervous.
715.0,718.0,Interviewer,So why aren't you excited about that?
718.0,747.0,Subject,"No, I am excited. I'm not excited with sharing the bathroom with the entire hall because it's like you always have to carry everything to the bathroom. When you leave your dorm, you have to lock it and bring the keys with you. It's just a lot. And it's not like you could shower whenever you want if there's other people. I don't know, it's just the idea of that I'm not used to it."
747.0,776.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, so it seems like you might be losing a little bit of your own freedom in some ways even though you're gaining freedom from a curfew and things like that. And you've said a couple of times that you're excited to share space with someone your age, and having a sibling would've been nice. What do you think is kind of important to you about that?"
776.0,784.0,Subject,"Having someone to talk to or do things with, I guess."
784.0,790.0,Interviewer,And what kind of things would you talk about?
790.0,799.0,Subject,"Anything, honestly. [laughter] Stuff I would just talk to one of my friends about. Everything."
799.0,801.0,Interviewer,So are you very open and close with your friends?
801.0,802.0,Subject,Yeah.
802.0,803.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
803.0,804.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
804.0,812.0,Interviewer,So what does that look like? Do you share everything? Is it something--?
812.0,823.0,Subject,We talk about most days. We're comfortable with each other. Yeah.
823.0,830.0,Interviewer,And do you find that you make friends pretty easily?
830.0,836.0,Subject,Pretty easily. I'm okay. Yeah.
836.0,848.0,Interviewer,So it seems like you're having a lot of transitions recently with your gap year and then you're going to be starting college.
848.0,850.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely."
850.0,855.0,Interviewer,What do you think-- do you feel prepared for them? How do you feel like--?
855.0,891.0,Subject,"I don't feel prepared, actually. I was searching at my textbook list, and it costs so much money. Yeah. And some textbooks, you know how some people just get off [inaudible] cheaper like other people, but two of my classes were like the textbooks were textbooks that the teacher wrote, so they had a specific website for it, so you can't really buy off of anywhere else. You have to get it from there. And one of them was-- one of my classes is Friedrich, and that textbook was $100."
891.0,900.0,Interviewer,"Oh, my gosh. And is there any other way that you feel underprepared?"
900.0,912.0,Subject,"Yeah. I have to get everything by the first week of classes, but I still haven't ordered it because I don't know where to ship it to. [laughter]"
912.0,916.0,Interviewer,"Oh, so are you trying to find-- oh, I guess you'll be in a dorm, right?"
916.0,917.0,Subject,Yeah.
917.0,922.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you know which-- what your dorm looks like? Have you been thinking about--?
922.0,944.0,Subject,"It's a double. I actually didn’t get the roommate that I wanted. We put each other as top priority, but then we got put one floor apart from each other in the same building and the same dorm. So we're going to try to direct swap, but it’s just-- yeah, it's kind of stressful."
944.0,948.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How did you meet that person?
948.0,956.0,Subject,"Also online. And then we live pretty close, so we just met up. And we're pretty compatible."
956.0,960.0,Interviewer,Nice. That's so odd that they put you apart.
960.0,962.0,Subject,Yeah.
962.0,963.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] each other so much.
963.0,982.0,Subject,"Yeah, we both emailed our roommates to ask if one of them would be willing to direct swap. Because we also already bought some stuff together. And for the MicroFridge, we already split the bill for that too, so it's just kind of annoying that we didn’t get each other."
982.0,988.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Did you get any responses from those other roommates?
988.0,1000.0,Subject,"Her roommate hasn't replied to her yet. My roommate only replied to me once, and then she hasn't replied to the second email I sent yet in response to her."
1000.0,1001.0,Interviewer,Did she say [crosstalk]?
1001.0,1019.0,Subject,"She was like, ""For now, I don't think I can,"" because she said she was busy the entire day of moving, so she didn’t really want to move stuff around. But she said like, ""Maybe."" But for now, I don't think so."
1019.0,1022.0,Interviewer,So what does direct swap mean?
1022.0,1037.0,Subject,"It's just like when-- so for example, me and my friend's roommate, we direct swap. We just exchange places in the dorm for housing."
1037.0,1038.0,Interviewer,So--
1038.0,1039.0,Subject,We just directly swap with each other.
1039.0,1043.0,Interviewer,So you would take her rooming and she would take your rooming?
1043.0,1045.0,Subject,I take her place; she takes my place.
1045.0,1049.0,Interviewer,Right. So I guess only one of them needs to agree.
1049.0,1050.0,Subject,Yeah.
1050.0,1053.0,Interviewer,Okay. So there's hope. [laughter]
1053.0,1060.0,Subject,Yeah. Its just kind of stressful. Because I think both our roommates are also a year older than us.
1060.0,1063.0,Interviewer,Oh. That's interesting.
1063.0,1070.0,Subject,"I know mine is. Hers is even in the same program as her, so I don't even know [inaudible] to her."
1070.0,1076.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's funny. It's interesting [inaudible] just put first years with first years."
1076.0,1089.0,Subject,"Yeah. I guess it's because they didn’t have a lot of empty rooms, because we start spring semester. But it's still a little annoying."
1089.0,1098.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How do you feel about-- do you know that your roommate is older? Or is she--?
1098.0,1099.0,Subject,My roommate right now?
1099.0,1100.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1100.0,1105.0,Subject,I know she's older. I'm not sure about hers. But hers is in the same program.
1105.0,1109.0,Interviewer,How do you feel about rooming with someone who's older than you?
1109.0,1136.0,Subject,"It's okay. I don't mind, but I'd rather have my friend room with me because we're studying the same thing, our schedule is pretty similar, and it's a lot of similarities in comparison to the other person. But it's like not even the same-age group of friends and everything, so it'd be more inconvenient, I guess. But I wouldn't mind."
1136.0,1166.0,Interviewer,"So it's interesting that-- it's so surprising they did that, actually. That's cool that you guys are saying kind of the same thing and that you are generally pretty on the same page. What do you think it'll be like to live with a friend?"
1166.0,1185.0,Subject,"A friend? It'll be fine. It'll be less stressful. Yeah. Definitely a lot more relaxed. And someone that you know would support you. Just really comfortable, I guess."
1185.0,1194.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Is there anything that you think would be harder about living with a friend?
1194.0,1203.0,Subject,"Yeah. If your habits aren't the same, that might also cause your friendship to go south."
1203.0,1208.0,Interviewer,Are you worried about that at all?
1208.0,1224.0,Subject,"No. Oh, her? I met her online last year, so we're not super close. She's not a close friend, but I feel like we could get close during [dorming?]. [laughter]"
1224.0,1241.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, the closeness will come with being physically [crosstalk]. Sounds exciting. What about leaving home? How are your parents handling?"
1241.0,1261.0,Subject,They're sad. Yeah. My mom is also excited that I'll be out because she doesn't have to do my-- she won't have to clean up after me around the house. Yeah.
1261.0,1276.0,Interviewer,"I mean, you're their only child, right, so it'll be like a different phase of life. Did you grow up in New York? Yeah?"
1276.0,1277.0,Subject,Yeah.
1277.0,1280.0,Interviewer,So what was that like?
1280.0,1305.0,Subject,"I enjoyed it. I didn’t really start going out or hanging out as much outside until sophomore year of high school. So before that, I was pretty introverted. Yeah."
1305.0,1309.0,Interviewer,And what do you think made that kind of change how [crosstalk]?
1309.0,1327.0,Subject,"My friends changed me a lot, what I [inaudible] those friends, different friend group, I guess, and interest, I guess."
1327.0,1329.0,Interviewer,What does that mean?
1329.0,1335.0,Subject,I started to dance. Yeah.
1335.0,1337.0,Interviewer,So what kind of dance do you do?
1337.0,1346.0,Subject,"Hip-hop and K-pop. Yeah. But in high school, I wanted to do more hip-hop style."
1346.0,1352.0,Interviewer,And was that a big part of your life? How did that affect you?
1352.0,1359.0,Subject,It made me more open and outgoing. I'm less shy. Yeah.
1359.0,1361.0,Interviewer,Why do you think that is?
1361.0,1376.0,Subject,"I don't know. I guess performing on stage and everything, practicing in the cafeteria with a bunch of other groups. And I guess I just started expanding my friend group a lot more."
1376.0,1380.0,Interviewer,Pretty cool. How did you get into it?
1380.0,1405.0,Subject,"In freshman year, I actually saw the post there and I wanted to, but I wasn't going to. And then sophomore year, one of my friends invited me to join her group and asked me if I wanted to join with her, and then I was like, ""Yeah, sure."" And then after that, yeah, I just got a lot more social."
1405.0,1414.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's great that it was able to kind of open that door for you. Do you plan on doing it in college?
1414.0,1421.0,Subject,"Yeah, I do. I also kind of want to join a sports team, but I don't think I'm good at all for any of them."
1421.0,1423.0,Interviewer,Which sports do you think?
1423.0,1431.0,Subject,I want to do volleyball. Yeah. It's my favorite sport.
1431.0,1435.0,Interviewer,Do you know what about it makes it your favorite sport?
1435.0,1466.0,Subject,"I guess [ready or out?] I'm like-- how you could kind of dodge the ball. Because basketball, it's more like head-on contact, bumping into people, and it's just like a lot more physical. And then soccer, it's just I keep tripping over the ball. I just can't. I guess it's also because it's the easiest for me."
1466.0,1468.75,Interviewer,That's interesting because it's really hard for a lot of people.
1468.75,1469.0,Subject,Really?
1469.0,1470.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
1470.0,1479.0,Subject,I don't know. I feel like pumping the ball and spiking the ball is easier than dribbling basketball. I can't dribble.
1479.0,1481.0,Interviewer,It sounds like you've played a lot of sports though if you know--
1481.0,1488.0,Subject,"No. I just tried, but never again. I just give up really fast."
1488.0,1492.0,Interviewer,So what makes you want to join volleyball in college?
1492.0,1511.0,Subject,"I want to be more active. Yeah. Because I just feel like I'm very-- I've been getting more and more out of shape, so that's one reason. And just working out is pretty boring to me. I don't know how people do it."
1511.0,1512.0,Interviewer,[inaudible] active?
1512.0,1513.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's like--"
1513.0,1514.0,Interviewer,Yeah?
1514.0,1517.0,Subject,Yeah. It's so repetitive.
1517.0,1519.0,Interviewer,Yeah. [inaudible].
1519.0,1521.0,Subject,"Yeah, right?"
1521.0,1558.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And I think sports definitely build a sense of community. So we have only a couple more minutes. I think it's really interesting that you're-- I remember, the time before college is super exciting and super kind of intense. I guess what is something that you think you'll miss about high school?"
1558.0,1577.0,Subject,"Definitely, all of my friends and just the area that we hang out in, how it's so tightly knit, I guess. All of that."
1577.0,1581.0,Interviewer,And do you think it will be different in college?
1581.0,1596.0,Subject,"Very. Yeah, it's a lot bigger, different buildings, and even living at the school."
1596.0,1615.0,Interviewer,"And it sounds like you do have this really good group of friends. And obviously, people tend to go to different colleges. So what kinds of things do you think will be important to you in terms of keeping up with them?"
1615.0,1636.0,Subject,"There are some that I text on a pretty daily basis. There are some I call occasionally, but we don't really keep in touch until we're in the same area, or we just catch each other up to date when we do meet up. So I'm not too worried about [inaudible]."
