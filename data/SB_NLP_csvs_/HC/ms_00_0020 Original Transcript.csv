0.0,6.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,107.0,Subject,"So recently, I was able to travel out of state, and I was able to see some of my really good friends from college, so I was super excited about that. On Friday, I took a train-- I took an eight-hour train out to my college, and I got to spend time with my boyfriend and some of my college friends. And I was hoping I could get into this because I talk about it forever I feel like. But I had so much fun. I went and I visited waterfalls. And I went berry-picking. And I went swimming in the pool, and I had so much fun. Previous to that, I was a little bit, I don't know, anxious and depressed kind of just being in the same house all the time. But I was so excited to go out. I actually ate at a restaurant. That was so nice. I haven't eaten at a restaurant in probably about four or five months. And I'm not someone who usually eats out at a restaurant, but it really impacted me. I was so excited. I probably eat out about once every two weeks. But it was still so nice to indulge and sit down and have a conversation with someone and not do any of the cooking or the dishes. It was something completely different. And I never thought that I would really appreciate something because I didn't really think I was that connected to it. But I realized how much of an everyday thing it was, so. Yeah, I had a lot of fun. I had a lot of fun this weekend. And so right now it's doing good. I just got back actually last night so I'm kind of sleeping a little bit today. [laughter]"
107.0,110.0,Interviewer,"Yes, you got to work hard, play hard or sleep hard."
110.0,111.0,Subject,Yes.
111.0,130.0,Interviewer,"That sounds so great. I know during this time it is really important to experience the little things. So what were you feeling like before that? You said you were kind of feeling a little bit depressed, a little bit anxious. What was that like?"
130.0,200.0,Subject,"It's a little bit hard. I'm not used to feeling anxious or depressed. I'm usually a very bubbly person, very outgoing. I love to talk to people. I love to be outdoors. I always have a whole bunch of outdoor projects going on. But ever since this whole COVID, I don't have a job, my school stopped, and that was pretty much the basis of what I would do every day. And then in all the little gaps, I would fill in time for my friends, and I would fill in time for outdoor stuff and exercise. And now I have all this time on my hands, so it kind of-- at first, I was like, ""Well, what do I do? I have to do something."" And then it got to the point where attending less social interactions, and I was getting a little bit sad. And then I was trying to take my mind off by doing lots of things. So I started a vegetable garden, and I've been walking my dog twice a day and then also running in the middle of the day. So I've been very, very active [laughter] trying to combat all the stressfulness and those bad feelings. I have to keep moving, keep doing stuff."
200.0,217.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Wow, you sound so active. That's amazing. I am curious, so what kind of program are you in and what was it like to all of a sudden just stop?"
217.0,225.0,Subject,It was definitely very hard for me. I'm in a physician assistant program. I actually got to graduate and my last--
225.0,226.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk].
226.0,322.0,Subject,"Oh, thank you [laughter]. My last year, I was doing everything hands-on. So I was going to different hospitals, different specialties of practices, and I was doing everything hands-on. And I was actually in the middle of my surgery rotation, and they were like, ""You can't come back. Everything's closed. No students."" And I was like, ""No, how I am going to do this?"" So we had online classes. That never compares to the real thing. That never compares to the hands-on stuff. So I would be in my room, and I would do online class for eight, nine hours a day. And I think that was driving me crazy too because it's just listening to a pre-programmed video on loop, and it was basically just kind of teaching you all the fundamentals to pass your big exam tasks. It wasn't even any of the hands-on stuff. It wasn't anything new. So it was hard to go from a setting where I was doing hands-on stuff, and then I would come home and waitress, and then I'd work out to okay, you're sitting in your room, you're watching class, you don't have that hands-on stuff, that's also less stuff you could put on your resumé, and you can't see your friends. You can't go outside. You can't really go shopping. You can't go adventuring or hiking, so. It was hard. It was hard at first. I am fortunate the fact that I got to graduate. I got to take my national exam, so that's kind of a step in the right direction. But I'm never going to get that time back. And I know a lot of people are suffering within the same boat as me too."
322.0,330.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It sounds really disappointing to kind of not get that. Did you get a graduation ceremony? No.
330.0,331.0,Subject,No.
331.0,333.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's a bummer. I'm sorry."
333.0,334.0,Subject,It's okay.
334.0,352.0,Interviewer,"It's exciting that you-- it seems like whenever this is over, you'll be starting this next chapter. And can you tell me a little about what drew you to being a physician's assistant and what that kind of looks like for you?"
352.0,546.0,Subject,"So I was always very interested in the healthcare field. My mom's in healthcare. And I think my youngest memory I had was anytime I got sick with the sniffles, stomach aches, they had like a day care at her hospital that she worked at where they would take care of your kids so you don't have to use any sick days. And this was a nurse, and it was like you're in a hospital room with a whole bunch of other kids. And I loved it. I loved being around the hospital. We would take walks. And I was the outgoing person saying hi to all the nurses, be like, ""Hi. Thank you."" And we would just kind of walk around and do a tour. And I got used to that hospital setting. And I got used to that growing up and I-- excuse me. I know a lot of people fear hospitals, but I had that inner love for it as such a little kid that I felt comfort being in one. And I kind of liked making friends, and I liked making people feel better. I would go up to patients and be like, ""I hope you feel better. I have a tummy ache too."" And it helped. So a little kid, it's like, ""Oh, my goodness, that's so sweet."" It's like a dog or something coming up to you when you're sick, like a service dog. It's like a little sick kid walking around too [laughter], but. So I kind of started really enjoying that, and I wanted to go into the medical field. And I was looking at all these different avenues. I was looking at MD, DO, and I realized like, ""Wow, I'm not going to get out until I'm 30 if even."" And I was like, ""Well, I want a family. I want kids. I don't want to have a million dollars in student debt before I make money."" And to me, money wasn't everything. And so I looked into that. I looked into pharmacy school. Half the schools I applied to were actually pharmacy schools because I was like, ""Oh, yeah, it's a three plus three program out of high school. It's only six years. It's not bad. You get your doctorate."" I did a lot of volunteering in the pharmacy setting. And I realized there wasn't enough social interaction. You just leave the pharmacist in the hospital in the basement. They're in the corner. They just do their job. They're in and out. You don't really talk to many people besides some of the techs that are there. And I felt I really want to talk to people. I really want to make them feel better. And, yes, I could give them drugs to make them feel better, but I want to have that one-on-one conversation. So the one pharmacist-- I was volunteering [inaudible], ""Why do you want to be a pharmacist? You should be a physician assistant."" And I was like, ""I've never heard of that before.""  So I looked into it, and it looked perfect to me. It was less amount of schooling. I did a program right out of high school. So it was only two and a half, two and a half, so I got out in five years which is awesome. And I get that patient interaction. Although I make less money, it's perfectly fine with me. Money isn't everything. And I actually get to have more time eventually with my family of my own and in the future. So that's kind of-- this is my [inaudible]."
546.0,561.0,Interviewer,That's awesome. So you brought up wanting a family. What do you think-- how do you see yourself balancing that work-life balance?
561.0,622.0,Subject,"So I definitely want to work the dayshift, work when they're at school. I like the fact that physician assistants have so many different options. I could do three twelves and be with them four days. Or when they're really little like they're infants, I would really like to do telehealth. I would like to be inside my own house. Say if the baby's asleep or dad's home, then I could log in for three hours and still get money and still try to support the family and still get that social fulfillment. I like that I could have so many little different avenues that I could stay home or I could go out and practice medicine. I think that's really nice option. And as the children grow older, I'll be more in like a clinic setting and try to adjust hours for picking them up from school. Or like with summer, I'll maybe take some more vacation time to go on trips."
622.0,626.0,Interviewer,Sounds like having a family is really important to you and being there.
626.0,685.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah, I think it's a big aspect. If you work, work, work, and you don't have any play, then what's your life worth? You can't bring all your money to the grave [laughter]. I'm learning that more and more. I'm kind of a person that just likes to work, work, work, and always constantly be doing something. And to me, I really have to step back and see, ""Hey, you're spending all this time working and getting all this money. You should use it. You should have fun with it."" And I really want to travel too when I'm really young, so. I'm going to try to take opportunities and use all my PTO time on vacation. I know that's probably not possible but as much as I can. You know try not to get sick and bank it all and try to go somewhere before I have kids too. Maybe a year out [inaudible] Caribbean or something."
685.0,692.0,Interviewer,Awesome. What do you think you'll do in [your for?] the Caribbean? What makes you want to go there?
692.0,794.0,Subject,"I just love to explore. So I've been to the different Caribbean islands many times. And there's always all these tours that they cost money like, oh, $100 and you'll go do this. You'll do this. And I'm like, ""Nah. Let's explore."" And what I usually do-- [inaudible] I can't talk [laughter]. I usually go with someone, usually my mom or my brother. And we'd go out, and we'd go find the locals, and we'll say, ""Hey, what's the coolest spot?"" And a lot of times, we'll take public transportation. And we'll see all these locals, and there's no other tourists. It's a little bit scary at first because you're like, ""Oh, wow. I hope I don't get lost. I hope I don't miss the boat or lose where the  resort is."" And we usually find some really cool spots. I went to Bermuda one time. And we went on this cool hiking trail, and we saw monkeys, real monkeys through the trees. And we were like, ""What?"" There was no one else down there. It was just the locals walking around. And we were exploring everything. It was really cool, so. I really like to explore the land. I like to not go on the regular path for tourists and just kind of explore what the actual land is like. I really want to explore culture and all the different cultures over in Europe and try all the different foods. I know we have all  American versions. But I want to try the real thing and go to all the little hole-in-the-wall places. I think that would be super cool and bring lots of memories, take lots of pictures."
794.0,810.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. You get a really rich experience when you do it that way when you're not just with a tour guide but you get to experience kind of a slice of life that goes on there. Yeah, I definitely agree. That's really cool."
810.0,814.0,Subject,"You just got to be careful, though. Don't get lost or anything."
814.0,844.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Okay, so you're interested in travel. You've kind of got a path set up for yourself. You mentioned at the beginning of this call that it was such a relief to kind of see people again. And it seemed like you're a very active person and socializing is a big part of that. And so I want to hear a little bit more about your relationships with your friends and you said your boyfriend?"
844.0,845.0,Subject,Mm-hmm.
845.0,848.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what is that like?
848.0,1034.0,Subject,"So I'm the kind of person that has a few friends, but they're very close to me, and they're very important to me. I was never someone who wanted or needed a hundred friends. I kind of stick towards the same people. And I really like to see the relationship blossom and grow throughout the years. I really cherish all the experiences and just kind of catching up with people. With my boyfriend, we've been dating for over two years now. And it's kind of-- I guess now it is a long-distance relationship. But when I was in school, he was very close, and I met him out there. And it was a lot of fun. We're both two different professions per se. We're very opposite in what we do. But it just kind of really meshed. We're both like a similar personality despite us being in two different [laughter] fields and stuff. And it was actually a breath of fresh air because I was just so used to all these Type A personality, like always studying and being competitive. And it was so nice when I met him. He was like, ""I have no idea what a heart does."" And it's like, ""Yes, [laughter] yes."" But what he is is he's a mechanic. He's a car mechanic. And he does a lot of the trucks and stuff, so. It was actually really fun when I was studying, and he's like, ""Oh, what's that?"" And I'm like, ""Okay, you know what the engine does,"" and I'd compare it in terms of the body part to what the car does. And he'd teach me like, ""Oh, that's what this does."" And I still don't know everything, but. It's really funny. So we make the joke he's the car doctor, and I'm the people doctor [laughter] go back and forth, but. Sorry, I go off a lot on tangents, but. Yeah, so we have a great relationship. We've been going pretty strong. We're both goofy personalities. We both like to adventure. This weekend, we saw a few waterfalls, and we went down natural water slides. So it was so exciting. We've been kind of meaning to do that for the past year and a half, and we finally got to go out and do it. With my friends, I mostly like to have these little get-togethers in the house, maybe go out to bars, maybe get food. A lot of the friends that I met and that I really grew with were the ones that I ran with. So I ran competitively in college. And just having the bond with being with these girls every single day and hearing their bad moments and hearing their good moments, I feel like I really grew with them. So those I feel were the bonds that really stayed and grew the most, but. And we do run occasionally now. I mean, we're all not running now, but sometimes we'll be like, ""Oh, we'll go for like a little easy jog just to get energy off."" But we usually kind of meet up in a house now and just chill."
1034.0,1042.0,Interviewer,That's so nice. And I'm glad you got a chance to see them again. I know it's pretty hard. Where are you now?
1042.0,1044.0,Subject,I'm in New Jersey.
1044.0,1047.0,Interviewer,Right. Are you staying by yourself?
1047.0,1050.0,Subject,I'm in my parent's house.
1050.0,1052.0,Interviewer,How is that?
1052.0,1130.0,Subject,"It's okay. It's hard because I'm getting of that age that I have different views than my parents. And it's a little bit hard. I always want to be out and about. And they're like, ""You have to be inside."" I'm their little baby girl. They don't want me to leave. I'm the youngest one. And they really don't like me traveling or leaving with this whole coronavirus. I think there was a whole two months that I never even left the house. I was really going [inaudible]. ""Could I just go and pick up a chicken at the store? That would make me so happy. I wouldn't talk to anyone. I wouldn't touch anything. I'd just grab the chicken and leave. But just seeing different people's faces would make me happy. And it sounds so silly but just walking around and having a different environment, so."" It's a little bit hard because they are a little bit extreme in their ways. They have a certain way of doing everything. And sometimes they don't always agree. And I’m getting to that age where I'm like, oh, you know. I can get a house, but I don't want to yet [laughter]. And I'm starting to have different opinions on some of the stuff, and I want some freedom. And I'm still their baby girl to them, so it's hard for them to give me freedom."
1130.0,1140.0,Interviewer,Yeah. You mentioned being the youngest. What is it like to be the baby?
1140.0,1198.0,Subject,"I guess it's a little bit frustrating because I have an older brother, and he can do the same exact things, and they're totally fine with it. Like he's been out of state this entire time of coronavirus. I'm like, ""Well, why can he do this?"" And we're only 16 months apart, so it's not like it's really big age gap. It's a little bit over a year. And it's a little bit hard. It's like, ""Why can he live with his girlfriend and be out there and only come home once a year? And I'm stuck here all the time."" And I feel like I'm more mature because he's the boy. Sometimes they're a little less mature. So it's a little bit-- I feel like there is different regulations. They try to make everything even, but it's hard. Because I'm a female and he's a male, so they're a little bit more protective of girls [laughter]."
1198.0,1210.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I think no matter how hard parents try that often ends up happening. So are you guys close, you and your brother? You guys are really close in age [laughter]."
1210.0,1316.0,Subject,"Yeah. So growing up a lot of people used to mistake us for twins just because we were always so close. The one time we were at summer camp, someone was like, ""Are you guys dating?"" And we were like, ""Ew, no. Ew,"" just because we were just so close. We always liked to do outdoorsy stuff. So we were really close growing up probably until he went to college. We kind of started growing away from each other just because we physically weren't there. We kind of went on different paths in what we wanted to do. And, [let me think?], just kind of-- we just [swayed?] different ways. We have different beliefs now. We're in different locations, so it's hard to catch up. I'll talk to him for an hour or so every week on the cell phone, but it's not the same. We almost had, growing up, almost like a non-verbal bond. Like he'll be on the couch playing video games, and I'll just be chilling eating chips and just watching him play. And I'd yelp [inaudible], ""Go, go, go. You got to do this."" I think what my parents did right was they put the PlayStation in my room. Every time he wanted to play, he had to hang out with me, one. And two, if I didn't want him in my room, he couldn't play it. So he couldn't play it all night. He couldn't play it all day, only when I allowed. So we kind of had that bond. And we would both do sports in the summer. So he'd come from football, and I'd come home from running cross country, and we'd pig out. And we'd eat everything in the house. And we'd just lay on the couch and watch Jerry Springer and South Park, all the stuff we couldn't watch. [laughter]"
1316.0,1317.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk].
1317.0,1346.0,Subject,"So, I mean we didn't really have any really close intimate conversations, but it was just each other's presence. We were always with each other. We were both [inaudible] and playing video games. But it wasn't anything like a-- I wouldn't say a normal relationship, but something that you would talk for hours and hours and get really close with them. We were close, but it wasn't my-- I can't really describe it really."
1346.0,1356.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I understand. How did it feel when he moved to college then? That must have been a pretty stark contrast.
1356.0,1420.0,Subject,"Yeah. I would miss him a lot. And it was hard because he only went about 20 minutes away for his undergrad, but he lived out there. And he never wanted to come home. So the same aspect of if he was home my parents would be like, ""Where are you going? What are doing? You're not allowed out. It's after 9 o'clock."" So he really didn't like all those stipulations. And they're still very strict, so he doesn't like to come home because of that. So even though he was only 20 minutes away, he could have been 4 hours away, and it would have been the same thing. So it was a little bit hard because I would see him every day. And we'd hang out every day after school, and we'd get ready at the same time for school. So it was a little bit hard not having him there. It was the worst the first year, so. And then I went to college. So then you're too busy making friends and figuring everything out to really worry too much."
1420.0,1441.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So it's interesting that you have said, both about your brother and about your parents a little bit, that you have kind of different views from them. I'm just kind of wondering what those are. How do you see yourself as having different views?"
1441.0,1542.0,Subject,"So for my parents, they're perfectly content with coming home from work and laying on the couch and watching tv. And they're perfectly content with drinking a beer and listening to music. And for me, I come home and I'm like, ""Let's do something. Let's go out. Let's do this. Let's see this. Let's try this."" So it's different in that sense that I'm like more of a go-to, let's go, and they're more like, ""Hey, let's relax. Let's unwind and all gather around the couch and do something."" They like to play Jeopardy! I feel like they're starting to get into older people. They turn on, 7 o'clock Jeopardy! time. And they get so excited. And they're competitive. And they count how many questions they get right. And they compare it to me and my mom-- my dad compares it to me and my mom. And we figured that out. And sometimes I'd rather be like, ""Oh [wait?], I want to go out with my friends. I want to do this,"" or, ""I'm going to go hiking,"" or, ""I'm going to go fishing."" So it's we're different in that sense. For my brother, he's a little bit of an inside person too. He'd rather play Dungeons and Dragons than be outside and out and about too. So it's kind of similar. And also politics, we're, me and my brother really-- we really strayed apart on that. So sometimes it's hard to have really intimate conversation about what's going on in the world because we're just butting heads. And I'd rather not do that. I don't want to fight or-- because we're very strong-headed on either side, so. It's a little bit harder to talk about that stuff."
1542.0,1549.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Do you think politics are important to you?
1549.0,1630.0,Subject,"I think so. I feel as though I bond more with people when they have similar interests, more similar backgrounds, and how everything is going on and should be done, and it's a big thing. When I went out of state to Pennsylvania-- I went to Western Pennsylvania. And my boyfriend and his family, they were all the same political affiliation, so it was a breath of fresh air. I was like, ""Yes, I get to talk everything. I get to say everything that I want to say."" And it's the same with my parents too. I'm the same political affiliation. And just there's so much going on in the world sometimes you just kind of-- you just need to vent. You just need to let it all out and say what's on your mind. No one's going to be fighting against you. My one friend that I hung out with, I knew she was a different political affiliation, so I would try not to bring anything up. And we were butting heads, and I was hanging out with her for six hours. Once I got done with being at her house, I was like, ""[inaudible] over. I can't take it anymore. It's just too much,"" because it was constantly fighting back and forth and walking on eggshells. I don't want to lose friends over something silly like that. I just feel right now in the world it's a very big hot topic, and it kind of revolves around everything that's going on with the whole world and what's going on with everyone, so."
1630.0,1646.0,Interviewer,Yeah. What's an example of something that you feel really passionately about that you find frustrating when people don't agree with?
1646.0,1655.0,Subject,I'm trying to think of one solid thing without trailing off into lots of other stuff.
1655.0,1658.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk]. Do whatever.
1658.0,1773.0,Subject,"[laughter] One of my pet peeves is when people talk about something very strongly, very passionately, and they're dissing people, and they don't know the whole story. They're just going off this little thing. And people try to explain the whole story to them, and they don't want to hear it. They don't want to listen. They just want to know that their thing is right. And I'll go onto politics. And I don't know if you want to hear this or not, and I apologize. But most recently what got to me was there was the two lawyers on the news. And they had guns, and they had guns pointing at the protesters. And like, ""Wow, that looks really bad and looks really scary."" But if you look at the whole entire picture, you'll see that they broke down their own gate to their private property. And then you're like, ""Wow, now that makes more sense."" And those people really didn't want to shoot. They weren't going up to these people. And you have the right to bear arms if someone's trespassing and you're like, ""Oh my goodness, I'm afraid that they're going to hurt my palace or hurt my house or whatever."" Yeah, you have the right to defend. They weren't like going out and tracking people down in the streets. I'm all for the protest. Good, get your voice heard. I just want them to stay peaceful, and I don't want them to be violent. So that was one of the things. I can't really be on Facebook too much because there's a lot of one sides. And a lot of people will get mad, like ""Oh my goodness, they're shooting guns."" I'm like, ""Have you seen the pictures? They broke their gate down. They're on their property. It would be bad if they were on the streets."" But that was one of the little things. There's so much other stuff. But just the main thing is I just like to see the whole story. And I want people to see the whole story."
1773.0,1777.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean the truth of the whole story, right, not snippets of it."
1777.0,1798.0,Subject,"And it's so hard because the media on either side too. The left and the right, they're not showing the whole story, and I feel like that's dividing us. If there was news that showed the entire story of everything that's going on, I feel like there'd be a lot less conflict."
1798.0,1824.0,Interviewer,"I agree. I think whole story and, like you said, listening is just-- it'll get us farther for sure. Yeah. I know these are really kind of unprecedented times, but it'll end. And what do you see yourself doing as soon as this is all over?"
1824.0,1877.0,Subject,"If you would have asked me that a few weeks ago, I would say immediately go to a restaurant. But I did that, so I don't have as much cravings to go to a restaurant anymore. But maybe go to a restaurant again, maybe go to a bar. I kind of live on the shore, so I would love to go to a little tiki bar and just lay out and relax. I'm super excited. I want to go on a cruise. They're so cheap. I just want the antibody testing, make sure I'm not going to get sick, and then I'll go on my merry [laughter] way and get out and just take a little vacation from all this craziness. They're also so cheap, and I just want to go out. I want to get away. I tell you what I'd do. I want to go on vacation or get away from it all."
