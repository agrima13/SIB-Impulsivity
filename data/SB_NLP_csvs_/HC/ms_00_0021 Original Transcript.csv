1.0,7.0,Interviewer,So my first question for you is how have things been going for you lately?
7.0,32.0,Subject,"Things have been going well for me actually. In school, I just started my last semester of the year today. So things have been going well. I have 18 out of 120 credits for my bachelor's. So things have been going well."
32.0,36.0,Interviewer,That's awesome. So you're almost done.
36.0,44.0,Subject,"Oh, no. This is just the first year. I have four more years to go."
44.0,47.0,Interviewer,Sorry. I thought you said you had 18 left. That's so great.
47.0,49.0,Subject,"No, 18 of 120."
49.0,55.0,Interviewer,"Ah, gotcha. So what are you studying?"
55.0,68.0,Subject,"Business Administration. Bachelor's in Business Administration. I really want to do Culinary Arts, but I think I do that after I get my business."
68.0,71.0,Interviewer,What makes you say that?
71.0,86.0,Subject,"Because I like to cook. I, one day, want to open my own restaurant. But as far as this pandemic going on right now, I don't know if anything is going to happen anytime soon anyway."
86.0,96.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, definitely. How has the pandemic impacted you in general?"
96.0,124.0,Subject,"I've gained some weight just from staying in the house. But as far as it's impacted me, it's just more boring because everything is closed and you have to go outside, wear a mask. You have to remember to take your mask. And every time the first person coughs around you, the first thing someone says is, ""Coronavirus."""
124.0,135.0,Interviewer,So true. So what made you go for a degree in business?
135.0,164.0,Subject,"Like I said, I originally wanted to take culinary art school first, but it was too expensive. And the school that I'm in is one of the cheapest online colleges you can go to. And plus, I want to-- if I go back into the work environment, I want to go in management other than versus just going as an entry employee."
164.0,169.0,Interviewer,So what's different about a management position?
169.0,203.0,Subject,"Oh, it's more money, but it's also more responsibilities. And I thought that I can do it. I was about to become a manager at Target, but they promoted other people before me. And I was like-- I wasn’t with it. And it's just weird having someone that's 22 your manager, your supervisor, and I'm 32 years old. I don't need anybody who is 22 telling me what to do."
203.0,206.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that sounds frustrating."
206.0,210.0,Subject,Yes.
210.0,214.0,Interviewer,Why do you think they did that?
214.0,236.0,Subject,"I honestly don't know. I honestly have no idea why the Target management team or HR is the way they are, but that's how they were. So I was there longer than this person. They still got picked at promotions. I was like, ""Whatever."""
236.0,240.0,Interviewer,So what did you do when that happened?
240.0,249.0,Subject,"I ended up resigning, and I ended up going to school."
249.0,255.0,Interviewer,That's great. So tell me a little bit about your school program.
255.0,326.0,Subject,"So I go to American Public University. It's based in West Virginia. It's a military college, but they also have the civilian part too, that's online. And the reason I chose it was because it was cheaper than the other schools I wanted to go to. Because I first tried to go to back to [inaudible] but they was giving me the run around. I had to write an essay on why you want to get back into school. Then we review it. Go get paper work from this, that, and the third showing why you left school back in 20-- was it 2014? They wanted me to go back and get paperwork. And it just made it a real headache. And then after I got all that and paid my dues, they still rejected me. So yeah, I just went ahead and went to school because, honestly, I want to prove the lady that was giving me the run around-- I want to prove her wrong that I can get back in school."
326.0,332.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How did that feel?
332.0,351.0,Subject,I was pissed because I went and spent my money on something-- I could have saved my money for anything else. But I ended up paying the school back and they still rejected me. It kind of hurt a little bit. But I just got back on the horse and went to another school.
351.0,354.0,Interviewer,Looks like you were successful.
354.0,355.0,Subject,Thank you.
355.0,359.0,Interviewer,So are you excited?
359.0,404.0,Subject,"Yes. Just this quarter or this semester is a lot of paper-- I'm taking on criminal law. It's mandated. I have to take this semester criminal law and I'm doing my introduction to business. And the criminal law is a lot of forums. You have to write a lot of posts, no tests, just a lot of posts, and it's just-- I'm excited about it, just I'm like, ""How can I come up with 300 words for writing this forum for three different people?"" I'll get it. It will come to me."
404.0,411.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So is it going to be-- so you're in an online course? 
411.0,412.0,Subject,Yes.
412.0,415.0,Interviewer,"Is that because of the pandemic, or was that not?"
415.0,417.0,Subject,No. No. 
417.0,423.0,Interviewer,So what are you doing outside of the course?
423.0,439.0,Subject,I have two cats and a puppy German Shepherd. I look up different recipes and try them out and mostly look at Netflix.
439.0,452.0,Interviewer,"Nice. And we started talking a little bit about your culinary interest, but I wonder what kind of made you really want to go into culinary arts."
452.0,487.0,Subject,"I've been cooking ever since I was eight. My mom, she used to work at night. So she'd leave me home by myself, told me to lock the door, don't-- and she says, ""You want something to eat?"" She just taught me how to cook Ramen noodles. Then I learned how to cook grits. Then she taught me how to fry chicken. And every little thing, I always watched the cooking shows, and I always hung out with Grandma when she was in the kitchen cooking. So that just rubbed off on me, and I just like to cook."
487.0,493.0,Interviewer,So do you think cooking reminds you of family?
493.0,516.0,Subject,"Yes and no. It does because I always try to perfect my mother's recipes, but no because cooking is everywhere. It's everything. So that's one thing, that people always buy food, so--"
516.0,522.0,Interviewer,Fair enough. Are you close with your family?
522.0,547.0,Subject,"My mother, yes. I talk to her every day. I'm from South Georgia. I've been in Georgia, and I've been in New York three and a half years now. So I'm close to them because I talk to everybody. Either I call them on Facebook Messenger or on Facebook. But I talk to my mom every day."
547.0,551.0,Interviewer,That's so nice. What do you guys talk about?
551.0,567.0,Subject,[laughter] Joke. I will joke with my mother because she tickles me. We just talk about family. She was watching my little cousins and just talk about how they were doing.
567.0,571.0,Interviewer,Is it a big family?
571.0,585.0,Subject,"My mom only had two kids. And my grandmother, she had seven. And most of them were in Atlanta."
585.0,589.0,Interviewer,So you moved three and a half years ago. What made you come up here?
589.0,630.0,Subject,"Oh, God. I was, honestly, tired of-- I was 30 years old, lived at my mom's house with nothing going for myself. And I was petrified to come up here. But I had a friend that stayed up here already, because I met him back in 2010 in Texas. He had just got out of the army. He said he was going to New York, I should come one day. So we stayed in touch through the years. And this particular day, he was, ""Do you want to come to New York?"" I was like, ""Yeah."" He said, ""Just come up here, and you'll be good."" And ever since I've been up here, I've been all right."
630.0,636.0,Interviewer,Awesome. So what did you do when you first got here? What was that like?
636.0,707.0,Subject,"Okay. When I first got up here, I remember the day, it was March 14th of 2017, and it was cold outside. But I was in a [inaudible] when I woke up the next day-- first, the night I got up here, I stayed at my friend's his boyfriend's house. And they're Jamaican descent. And they welcomed me in. We had so much fun just walking through New York. Here is a drink. Let's get drunk. But the next day, it was cold, but when I went outside it just had a little blizzard. I've never seen that much snow before. So it was just like how it's outside now, it's all nice. Then the next day just two feet of snow. What in the world? And I had the experience, I was walking in the snow and I stepped in a puddle. But I didn't know it was a puddle. So that's my whole experience. I enjoyed it."
707.0,726.0,Interviewer,"That's great. And so tell me a little bit about the last three years. That's a really incredible story for your first kind of morning, waking up and having this kind of weather shock."
726.0,813.0,Subject,"Well, I moved up here, stayed with my friends for two weeks, then I went into a shelter because they put me through the whole process of trying to get you a place. So I went to the shelter. I stayed in the shelter about two months. And I was lucky to get me an apartment that fast, because there's people that have been in the shelter a year and some change and still haven't gotten an apartment. So I was like, ""I got me an apartment, I'm lucky."" Then I got the apartment. And June of 2017, that's when I got my first apartment. And it was all right. I'm in New York. I've been here a couple of months and I got my first apartment. But I got the apartment because I just didn't want to stay in a shelter anymore. That was my worst apartment. But after that, I got a job in November. My first job working at Eden. It was a restaurant off 42nd. And then after that, I started working at Target. I was working at Target for a year and a half. So I'm doing stuff with myself other than being down in Georgia doing nothing. And it's just been going ever since."
813.0,819.0,Interviewer,So what was it like to be in that first apartment?
819.0,856.0,Subject,"I was happy in the sense that I got my first apartment. But that first apartment needed so many repairs. It had leaks, only had one plug to a room, one outlet to a room. It was hot. I was just wondering how those flies that's coming-- I had the windows closed, but all of a sudden, there were 10 flies in my house. Where are they coming from? I had rats, well, mice. It wasn’t a good apartment, but I was happy to have my first apartment."
856.0,883.0,Interviewer,Do you think there has been anything-- it sounds like you're very perseverant and that you just kind of keep going even when you're faced with things that aren’t ideal. What do you think you would like to do after you finish this business degree?
883.0,914.0,Subject,"Hopefully, I can go into the working world and actually make some real money after I pay off my student loans, of course. But I honestly want to go into the working world. I want a career. I want to have a house. I want a car. I want things. I just don't want to settle for the basics. So the only way you get them, if you work for it."
914.0,918.0,Interviewer,So what do you feel like is your position now?
918.0,933.0,Subject,My position right now is to maintain and stay in school. I don't have anything-- I'm not doing anything else but stay in school and just cram through until I finish this degree.
933.0,946.0,Interviewer,"Awesome. And so what is it like to do it online, do you think, rather than in person?"
946.0,1031.0,Subject,"It's a little harder because you actually have to apply yourself to it. Because honestly, I can tell you, I sit here sometimes, it's boring but you've got to come up with, like I said, 300 words. So spinning something instead of just saying, ""It was great. I like what you wrote,"" you have to sit here and connect with the person that posts the post and make the references to whatever they're posting [at the top?], and you have to make 300 words. And it just can't be I, I, a, a, an, an, it has to actually come together as a statement. And it's a little challenging, because versus being in a classroom, you have other people that you actually-- peers that you actually can talk to and it seems like a little more connecting versus being online, you don't talk to anyone. You're not-- what's the word? You don't connect with people like you would do in a classroom. So you have to do it by yourself and just make up for what you don't have."
1031.0,1053.0,Interviewer,So mentioned these posts seem really challenging sometimes. What about them do you think is the most challenging? You said coming up with an argument. What kind of arguments are you-- like a response. What kind of responses are you being asked for?
1053.0,1119.0,Subject,"Okay. So I would go back to-- actually, I like my last class, Economics on 201 on macroeconomics. And we had to come up with an argument about the GDP and how it relates to unemployment. And you just can't say that when the GDP is higher, unemployment rates is lower. You have to sit here and say how they go together and if the unemployment rate is higher, why is the GDP percentage, why is it increasing? You have to explain why. And it's just not because people are not looking for jobs. I listen to them know that unemployment-- I'm not considered unemployed because I wasn’t looking for a job, versus unemployment is going out, people that went out looking for a job within a six month radius. And you have to come up with an argument about that."
1119.0,1128.0,Interviewer,So it seems like you have a lot of these. What have been the topics that interest you most?
1128.0,1170.0,Subject,"Honestly, I did like talking about macroeconomics, but my favorite classes, which is tricking because it was mandatory, I had to have so many hours of this class of foreign language. And I took French. And the one that I liked the most was when we started talking about French music. And honestly, I like it because I'm a music person. I listen to music almost all day. And I actually added a couple of artists to my playlist off of the French music that I've never heard before. So it really stood out to me."
1170.0,1176.0,Interviewer,That's awesome. What do you think you liked about this?
1176.0,1197.0,Subject,"I'm more an alternative-rock person, like Nirvana, Blink-182, Lincoln Park. And some of this music sounded somewhat similar to that, but it was all French. But the bass and the beat, I loved it."
1197.0,1201.0,Interviewer,Great. Has music always been something that you enjoy?
1201.0,1217.0,Subject,"Yes. I like the instrumental of a song more than the song with the lyrics. So I listen to the beat, the instrumental of the song, more than I listen to just the actual song because I'm a beat junkie."
1217.0,1220.0,Interviewer,What's a beat junkie?
1220.0,1231.0,Subject,"You just like the beat. If a song comes out, the hook might be nice, but if the beat is nice, that's what got me."
1231.0,1237.0,Interviewer,Why do you think you are a beat junkie?
1237.0,1272.0,Subject,"Probably because I was in band. The first eight years of school, I was in the band. So we're always playing in the band. We're always playing a song or some song, something off the radio. They'll convert it to a instrumental and we play it. And I always like, Beethoven, Mozart, I'd listen to it, just the strong, relaxing instrumentals."
1272.0,1276.0,Interviewer,What made you join band?
1276.0,1289.0,Subject,"Just to do something. I was bored, and all of my friends were in band. They're like, ""Why don't you come to band?"" Okay. I did. I liked it."
1289.0,1292.0,Interviewer,Why did you play?
1292.0,1293.0,Subject,I played the trumpet.
1293.0,1296.0,Interviewer,The trumpet? That's so hard.
1296.0,1306.0,Subject,"Yeah. It wasn’t that hard, but I liked it. I haven't played since middle school, but--"
1306.0,1311.0,Interviewer,So what made you choose the trumpet?
1311.0,1332.0,Subject,"To be honest, when I first joined the band, that was the only instrument-- first I thought about the French horn, but my French horn string broke and the teacher never fixed it. So the only other instrument that was in there was the trumpet. So I thought maybe [inaudible] trumpet and I liked it."
1332.0,1334.0,Interviewer,Do you play any instruments now?
1334.0,1339.0,Subject,No.
1339.0,1346.0,Interviewer,So what was it like to kind of stop playing music?
1346.0,1372.0,Subject,"I tried to get into the high school-- the high school, that's when you do the whole football field and coordination and everything. I tried to get into it. I just didn't like it. So I went from band to RTC. So that was that little thing. I just didn't want to be in band anymore at the middle school."
1372.0,1376.0,Interviewer,So you were in high school RTC?
1376.0,1377.0,Subject,Yes.
1377.0,1380.0,Interviewer,What was that like?
1380.0,1392.0,Subject,"Challenging, very physical, as far as we did some of the things that military people do. But it taught m discipline."
1392.0,1398.0,Interviewer,Do you think you enjoyed that experience?
1398.0,1419.0,Subject,"Yes. Up until I almost joined the services when I was in high school, except the war broke out in 2004. 2001, the towers fell and then the war in 2004, '05. I was like, ""No."" That's the only reason that I didn't join."
1419.0,1429.0,Interviewer,"So what do you think-- so aside from the war, what do you think made you want to join?"
1429.0,1444.0,Subject,The benefits and you get to travel the world. You get to travel and they will pay for your education. It would have been a good experience if I would have went.
1444.0,1452.0,Interviewer,So is it something that you would want to revisit?
1452.0,1460.0,Subject,"If I could, I would. If I can go back to those last years of high school, I would."
1460.0,1465.0,Interviewer,Even with the war going on?
1465.0,1478.0,Subject,"Yes. Because I knew then too, but if you go in as-- and I could have went in as a cook, I wouldn't have been part of the war."
1478.0,1481.0,Interviewer,Interesting. Why is that?
1481.0,1490.0,Subject,"I honestly don't know, but I know that cooks aren’t no part of the combat. So I wouldn't have went into the combat part."
1490.0,1505.0,Interviewer,"So it sounds like cooking is something that you've been interested your whole life, like even-- so in an ideal world, what would your restaurant or-- what would that look like?"
1505.0,1527.0,Subject,"Soul food and bakery items, like cakes, breads, and soul food, greens, chicken, barbeque, casseroles, stuff that you all see in a regular restaurant all the time."
1527.0,1530.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, for sure, and especially up here."
1530.0,1538.0,Subject,"Yeah. Pizza, Chinese food, yeah, no."
1538.0,1542.0,Interviewer,So do you miss the real soul food of the south?
1542.0,1553.0,Subject,"Yes. I do. I'm not saying that that I need it, because I need to go on a diet, because I've gained some weight because of corona. But I miss it."
1553.0,1561.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Have you found anything up here that's at all decent before corona?
1561.0,1563.0,Subject,Decent as in what?
1563.0,1567.0,Interviewer,Decent soul food.
1567.0,1582.0,Subject,"No. [laughter] No, I give everybody a try. And it always tastes so commercial."
1582.0,1583.0,Interviewer,What does that mean?
1583.0,1603.0,Subject,"It all tastes the same. Like every Chinese place tastes the same. Okay, Papaya Dog was good. That's hot dogs and a little stuff. But I like the Papaya Dog. And I like BB Juice."
1603.0,1605.0,Interviewer,Never been there.
1605.0,1616.0,Subject,"Yeah. But it's commercial, like Olive Garden and stuff like this, it comes out of the freezer."
1616.0,1629.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So you said soul food and bakery items. What do you think-- so where do you think you want to have this restaurant?
1629.0,1657.0,Subject,"If I could, I would have me a shop in New York, but I also have one in Atlanta. Yeah, because I'm from Georgia, so why not have one in my home state? But I will have one up here, just a small little restaurant up here and make plates for people, cakes, rolls, breads."
1657.0,1678.0,Interviewer,"Sounds so good. Wow. I can't wait to come visit. [laughter] And so you're going to get the business degree, and then what are your kind of next steps in joining the work force? What do you think would be a good job for after your degree?"
1678.0,1712.0,Subject,"I would go into the restaurant field, but I don't know-- because I've worked in the restaurant field before, and that's hard work. But I'll work as hard. So I honestly don't know. Hopefully, I can find a good-- I wouldn't mind working for a law firm. I'm not saying a lawyer or something like that, but be a paralegal or something."
1712.0,1721.0,Interviewer,So do you think your classes that you've been taking recently have made you want to do that?
1721.0,1754.0,Subject,"In a sense, because they're not full classes. They're only eight weeks. And right now, I'm basically taking all the mandatory classes, because I haven't gotten to my core classes yet at all. But some of them make me want to think I just might be a nice assistant in a way or something, something doing at a desk."
1754.0,1777.0,Interviewer,"So you think like a desk job? Yeah.  I think that makes sense. And so eventually, when you have this restaurant, do you think this is something that you'll kind of do alone? Do you want a partnership? What do you think you want?"
1777.0,1793.0,Subject,"Probably a partnership, probably. But I don't know any partners as of yet. But I know it's going to be stupid hard to do it alone."
1793.0,1798.0,Interviewer,So why is that? What goes into opening restaurants? I don't actually know.
1798.0,1818.0,Subject,"I don't either. I haven't gotten to those classes yet. I know it takes more than just having a building and buying merchandise. You have to have checks and balances and loans and a lot more stuff. I haven't gotten though those classes yet, so--"
1818.0,1826.0,Interviewer,So do you think in this program they'll teach you specifically opening a restaurant? Or will it be opening a business in general?
1826.0,1851.0,Subject,"I think, in general, opening a business. Because right now, I'm taking the legal process and I'm finally into one of my first core classes, Introduction to Business. So I think it's just business in general."
1851.0,1862.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I'm sure there's different things for restaurants specifically, it seems. They got the food ratings and the [inaudible] rating. It seems like a lot."
1862.0,1868.0,Subject,Yeah. The department of health has something to play a bit.
1868.0,1879.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So how have you been kind of coping now? Are you cooking at home? Yeah? What kind of things have you been cooking?
1879.0,1906.0,Subject,"Right now, since it's hot outside, I've been really grilling a lot. I mean I have a indoor stove-type grill too, but I've been grilling a lot of foods. And I really need to change how I've been eating. So everything I'm eating is not health. [laughter]"
1906.0,1907.0,Interviewer,"Well, it's quarantine. What are you going to do?"
1907.0,1910.0,Subject,Yeah.
