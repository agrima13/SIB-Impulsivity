0.0,5.0,Interviewer,"The first question I'll start with is, how have things been going for you lately?"
5.0,67.0,Subject,"Things have been pretty good. I'm a little stressed in life right now. There's just a lot of things happening. My mom is selling our house that I've lived in my entire life, so it's just a lot of packing and throwing things out. We're both moving to New York City in different apartments. I'm moving in with my boyfriend, which is very exciting but also stressful because we don't have an apartment yet. And I just finished my first year of graduate school, which was amazing but weird too. I've done it virtually. So yeah, life is good. There's a lot of exciting things happening. It's just a lot all at once. I'm also trying to get a puppy in the fall. And I'm contacting breeders, but a lot of them aren't going to have availabilities until November because, in COVID, people still are getting a lot of puppies. So again, I'm just trying to juggle 100 things at once. But yeah, life is pretty good."
67.0,79.0,Interviewer,That's great. That does sound like a lot of stuff happening all at once. So what has been like to pack up your childhood home?
79.0,135.0,Subject,"It's been bittersweet. Like I said, I've lived here my entire life. My mom moved here when she was pregnant with me, so I've really never lived anywhere else. We have a lot of stuff. So my brother lives in California, and he came home in March to kind of help us clear out a lot of stuff, so that was really helpful. There's just a lot of stuff I had to throw out from my art projects from elementary school that I just didn't need. [laughter] But it was nice to go through it all and kind of just see what I wrote about and homework assignments in elementary school and stuff, so that part was fun. And then just sorting through everything is just a lot of work. And it's going to be hard to move from a house to an apartment because I'm used to space, obviously. I live on Long Island. I have a house moving into a one-bedroom that I'm sharing. So yeah, it's been bittersweet. [laughter]"
135.0,144.0,Interviewer,Absolutely. And so what has been the impetus to move to New York both for you and your mom?
144.0,189.0,Subject,"So I was actually going to move a year ago. So I go to Ferkauf, which is in The Bronx. And I just always intended to live in the city to make it an easy commute there. I was going to move a year ago. But with COVID and being remote, it just made more sense to stay at home where I didn't have to pay rent. And then, my mom has always had the idea of moving to the city after she retired. My grandparents lived in the city. And her sister lives on the Upper East Side too. So it was kind of just always going to happen, and this seemed like a good time because I'm moving out. She didn't necessarily want to be in the house alone, so it just kind of-- it worked out this way."
189.0,193.0,Interviewer,That's so exciting. And so you said you're moving in with your boyfriend.
193.0,222.0,Subject,"Yes. So we've been dating for five years. We met in college. And I had wanted to live on my own for a year. Like I said, I was supposed to move a year ago. I really wanted the experience of living in New York City on my own and being independent. But at this point, we just figured I'd be spending most of my time at his apartment, or he'd be spending most of his time at my apartment. It just didn't make sense to each have an apartment, so we're ready to move in together."
222.0,223.75,Interviewer,That's so exciting.
223.75,224.0,Subject,Yeah.
224.0,233.0,Interviewer,"And so you said you finished your first year of graduate school. What was that like? I know it was virtual, you said."
233.0,291.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, it was great. I learned so much. It was the most work I ever had to do in my life, definitely way more intense than college. And I took two years off. In between college and grad school, I was a research coordinator just like you. And so kind of transitioning from a 9:00 to 5:00 job where I didn’t have anything to do after 5 o'clock and my weekends were free, it was a little difficult to go back to a full-time student. There was just so much reading and work and research. It was just a lot. I mean, I think it was a combination of the pandemic and grad school, but I really just didn't see people that often. I was kind of just busy all the time doing work. I think the pandemic definitely influenced that. I mean, I think-- I mean, I learned a ton. I'm really excited to keep going on with grad school."
291.0,304.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And what was your journey like to get to grad school? So what made you want to pursue this?
304.0,457.0,Subject,"So my mom's a psychologist, and my grandpa was a psychologist. So I actually didn't want to be a psychologist for my whole childhood because I know that's just what my family did. I wanted to be an orthodontist for my whole life. And then, in high school, I did a summer internship with an oral surgeon. And I have a really weak stomach. And I was watching him do as surgery, and I fainted, and it was this whole thing. And I said to myself, ""Okay. I can't deal with blood. I can't go to dental school. I couldn't go to medical school."" I just couldn't handle the gore. And then I was kind of just exploring. I thought maybe I could do speech pathology. I wasn't that interested in it the more I looked into it. And then the more research I did, the more psychology just made sense. And I'm interested in neuropsychology, not just clinical psychology. So that was kind of different from what my mom and grandpa did. So it just interested me. In college, I was a brain and cognitive science and psychology double major, so I learned a lot about the interaction between brain and behavior. I also took American sign language in high school and college, and that kind of interested me. It's related to everything with language and the brain. And then, this is a long story, but [laughter] I was interested, at first, in working with children. I love kids. And I did a few summer internships in college working with kids. And I realized that I love kids, but I don't love working with kids. So then, I did an internship with geriatric population at an Alzheimer's center, decided I love that population more. So then, after college, I worked for two years at a memory disorder center, working with patients with Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment. And I just really, really loved that work, loved the patients. I thought it was-- I mean, the disease itself is so interesting. There's so much research to be done and so much to be studied. And grad school just made sense. I'm sure, as you know, in the field, you can't really get that far without grad school. And so I looked for programs with clinical psychology with the option to do neuropsychology as well. And that's where I ended up."
457.0,479.0,Interviewer,"Awesome. So you said you kind of-- well, you didn't say that. You started to really like working with older adults and looking at MCI and stuff. What do you think about that population makes you want to work with them?"
479.0,523.0,Subject,"I just think it's so rewarding to work with someone in that population. They always have such incredible stories to share. And even if I come from such a different walk of life from someone, it's always fun to kind of just find some sort of connection and just being to offer them some hope. I mean, I worked in a research setting, so we were doing some trials, so just being able to offer them and their family some hope. This is a terrible disease, but maybe there's something that could help or slow down the progress. It was just great to see. Yeah. Just mostly the relationships I've had with these patients are just incredible."
523.0,535.0,Interviewer,"So what's the relationship that stands out to you, [even?] a story that kind of embodies why you like working with those [subjects?]?"
535.0,635.0,Subject,"I think there are so many. Well, one of them is-- so there's this woman who I couldn't look or-- not look, but she's a very different person for me. And the two of us next to each other, you would never think that we'd have any similarities. But based on our interview and just getting to know her, we had so much in common. This is just one part, but we both loved traveling. And I worked with her for like a year and a half. And over that time, we each took several trips. So every time I saw her, the first 30 minutes of the visit, she would just sit there and scroll through her cameral roll and just show me all the pictures of her and her family vacations. And I would tell her about my trips. And we just bonded over this love of travel. And it was so great to just build this relationship with someone that otherwise I never would have if I just saw her walking down the street. And there's this other woman who just completely, completely trusted me. I mean, again, I worked with her for a year and a half. And every time I saw her, she kind of told me more and more about her life. And she went through a lot of trauma as a child, and she had some significant postpartum depression, and she kind of just started revealing everything to me. And it was so special to have someone trust me that much that she wanted to share all of her life experiences with me, and I was just a 22-year-old kid who just graduated from college and didn't have much experience. But the fact that I was able to just build that trust with her and have her just tell everything to me was really great."
635.0,653.0,Interviewer,"That's sounds lovely. And so you said you really like to travel, and that's one of the things that you were able to connect about. What do you think makes you like traveling so much?"
653.0,683.0,Subject,"Just getting to experience a new culture with their food, art. The people that I meet while traveling is always interesting, seeing the famous-- I don't want to say structures but buildings and artwork and monuments and landscape, everything that comes with traveling. Basically just experiencing a new place is always great. And upsetting during COVID, not being able to go any places."
683.0,689.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So what has that been like to not be able to do the things you like, like traveling?"
689.0,716.0,Subject,"It's been hard. It's also upsetting because this year in grad school is when I have the most free time. As each year goes on, it's harder and harder to travel because you're just so busy with everything. So it was especially annoying because this is when I can travel, and I couldn’t. But I was able to take some smaller trips, so that was better than nothing. But yeah, it was mostly just frustrating, nothing we can do about it."
716.0,737.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, unfortunately. [laughter] Cool. So what do you think-- you said it's very different being in graduate school than what you were doing before and even in college. What about it do you think is so different?"
737.0,835.0,Subject,"The biggest thing I noticed is that in college, I feel like professors didn't want you to succeed as much. That might sound weird, but I'll explain it. So I feel like it's maybe just where I went to school, the exams were very, very challenging. And some of them were meant to weed out students. Those [internal?] bio and calculus courses, they're not set up for everyone to succeed and get As in. So I feel like the professors - I don't know - they taught the material. They held office hours, but I feel like they didn’t care as much if we really understood it and knew it well. But in graduate school, maybe because it's a smaller cohort and we're in a PhD program - it's not just undergrad - I just have a feeling that they want us to do well. So they go out of their way to teach us things in a certain way that makes it easy for us to use in real life rather than just answer it on a test. And the tests are there to kind of make sure we understand the material rather than to challenge us, and that was really great to see. And they're also just, I want to say, more lenient with grading. But I was able to do better so far just because they want us to be psychologists, and they want us to be able to use the skills we're learning. They don't care that we get tricked on an exam like a lot of the professors in college, I felt like, did. So that was one positive aspect I found from graduate school."
835.0,851.0,Interviewer,Cool. And what do you think-- what do you see yourself doing with the degree that you're trying to earn?
851.0,897.0,Subject,"So ideally, I would love to work in a hospital but also work in maybe not a private practice but in a more clinical setting. My dream would be to do three days a week in a hospital, two days a week in a clinic. I love the hospital setting because that's where you see the most diverse, interesting patients. They have interesting cases. And I'd be able to work at a research team in a hospital. But I also love the clinical side as well and doing neuropsych testing and also therapy in a clinical setting, so a mix of that would be great. But I have a lot of time, so that could change."
897.0,901.0,Interviewer,"Yes. Degrees are never short, are they?"
901.0,903.0,Subject,"No, never."
903.0,913.0,Interviewer,Okay. And what do you mean when you say that the cases are more interesting in a hospital? What is an interesting case?
913.0,1006.0,Subject,"I mean, I could give you an example of a case I had that I just feel like-- well, I feel like when you work in a private practice, for example, you're getting referrals from places, and they get screened out. And you're not just getting someone who would see an advertisement in the newspaper and just go on their own. I think it's a very different type of patient population. For example, when I was in my research job, we had this patient who had just retired as a judge. I don't know what type of judge, but she was very high up in the legal system. She recently started having some memory complaints, just wanted an evaluation. We did our routine evaluation. And I did this one neuropsych test, and it became clear to me that she was delusional. It's kind of hard to explain without telling you everything, but I can't give you details. [laughter] So I contacted the doctor that we worked with. We kind of gave her a more thorough evaluation with the doctor, and it was very clear that she had some more serious mental illness. She was delusional. We don’t quite know what it was because it was a research study, so we couldn’t do much more. But something like that, I just don't think would just show up to your private practice. It was very interesting to work with her. I had never seen a patient like that. I mean, it was a little scary to work with her, but it was eye-opening, I guess."
1006.0,1011.0,Interviewer,What made it scary for you?
1011.0,1076.0,Subject,"So she was so scared because she was having-- I can just tell you this, I guess. She was having these delusions that people were breaking into her house, and she thought she had evidence. Some of her things were misplaced, and she had called the police several times. Every time they came to her house, they said, ""There's no way they could have broken in. There's no signs of entry,"" all that type of stuff. And she just started crying because she was saying, ""No one believes me. I'm so terrified to be home."" And it was really sad because I wanted to show that I believed her. But it was kind of clear based on everything she told me that it was not possible, and it was delusional. So I was scared for her because it was hard for her to differentiate reality from her delusions, and she was so scared to be in her position. And it was hard to know how to help her. I mean, she was seeing a psychiatrist on her own, so I would hope that she's getting some sort of help, but it didn't seem like she was doing so well."
1076.0,1094.0,Interviewer,Right. So you said it was kind of moving and a little bit scary for you. How do you go about dealing with those feelings working with this vulnerable population?
1094.0,1132.0,Subject,"I mean, I think-- so I worked with a doctor when I was there. I wasn't doing it alone. And I think just listening to their advice, I think she kind of reassured me that she was already seeing a psychiatrist. There's nothing more we could have done. I mean, if the patient didn't have any help, I'm sure we would have done a lot more. So I think just talking with supervisors and people that are more experienced in the field was really helpful. I think if I was there alone, it would have been a lot worse. Yeah, just being able to talk it through and say, ""What we could have done next if this were to happen again, what the protocol would be,"" something like that."
1132.0,1151.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, absolutely. And so you said you worked with a doctor. Do you anticipate working with a doctor in your clinic setting or in a hospital in the future?"
1151.0,1154.0,Subject,As a student or postgrad?
1154.0,1155.0,Interviewer,Postgrad.
1155.0,1193.0,Subject,"I don't know. [laughter] I mean, I think the medicine side of things definitely has some benefits. In a research setting especially, I know that there are a lot of patients with high blood pressure or diabetes, and it was helpful to have a doctor working with us to kind of understand how those things played into the disease presentation. So I think a well-rounded team is important, so. Yeah, I can see that."
1193.0,1205.0,Interviewer,And I'm trying to get a sense of what you think is valuable to you on a team like that.
1205.0,1281.0,Subject,"I mean, I think everyone just brings something to the table. So I think a team-- we worked with a psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, neurologist, psychologist. So I think a neurologist is obviously the best at seeing someone with neurological disorders from the medical standpoint. So if someone was just diagnosed with MCI or Alzheimer's, we would send them to them. And if someone had, like I said, really high blood pressure or diabetes or anything medical, before seeing them in the study, we would have the doctor evaluate them to see if any of those symptoms were maybe causing their problems. And maybe there wasn't anything more than that. And then neuropsychologist is helpful to do all neuropsych testing and see if there is a neurodegenerative disease. And then a psychologist is helpful-- I mean, I guess a neuropsychologist could do this too. But if someone is coping with a new diagnosis or doesn't know how to process things like that, a clinical psychologist is helpful for that. I think nurses also play a role, social workers. I think a big team like that [laughter] would be the best."
1281.0,1291.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, very diverse. And so are you training to be the neuropsychologist or the more clinical psychologist [in this?]?"
1291.0,1292.0,Subject,Neuropsychologist.
1292.0,1298.0,Interviewer,And what do you think drew you to neuropsychology?
1298.0,1352.0,Subject,"So it really started, like I said, when I took sign language. And I was really just interested in how-- this was back in high school. I was just interested how the brain processed language in the form of sign rather than spoken language, and that kind of sparked my interest in just the brain. And then I did a major in brain and cognitive science. And I was just really interested in not only language but also when there were neurodegenerative diseases, how the interaction between neurodegeneration-- the interaction between neurodegeneration and behavior in everyday life, how those interplayed. And I just thought it was just really interesting. And like I said, I couldn’t do the medical standpoint. So to me, this was the closest to being a doctor I could be without having to go through medical school."
1352.0,1360.0,Interviewer,And what do you think made you want to be a doctor in the first place?
1360.0,1389.0,Subject,"I think just growing up with my family. Everyone in my family is really either a doctor or a psychologist. My aunts and uncles are all doctors of different types, and my mom and my grandpa are psychologists, so it's kind of just what I grew up with. And I just love the profession of helping people. I think that's really important and just a way to give back. So yeah, maybe a combination of it's kind of what I knew, but I also love it."
1389.0,1414.0,Interviewer,"That makes sense. And [laughter] so your story about working with a dentist or an orthodontist and kind of having that experience of fainting, what was it like for you to kind of realize that maybe medicine wasn't for you? What was that kind of transition? What did it feel like?"
1414.0,1524.0,Subject,"It was really hard. I think I was, I want to say, 15 or 16. And for my entire life, I had thought I knew what I wanted to do. A story my mom loves to tell, when I went to the dentist when I was really young, maybe when I was four years old, my favorite color was purple, and the dentist that saw wore purple gloves. And I think that is what started me wanting to be a dentist. And then all throughout childhood, I always said I wanted to be a dentist. And then when I started in high school, trying to see if I could actually be a dentist, it was really, I guess, devastating to realize I couldn't do it. And I guess could have. I could've pushed through it. And I think my mom said, ""This is just one experience. Why don't you try again?"" But I knew that the blood and the gore, I couldn't do it. I was so sick after seeing that one thing. And I had a period for maybe a year in high school that I just had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and it was so hard. Because my whole life, everyone knew I wanted to be a dentist. So yeah, that was hard. But it was also in high school, and I didn't have to know what I wanted to do, so that was also reassuring. But I'm the type of person where I need to plan out my entire life. So I kind of quickly-- not quickly, but like I said, I had thought of being a speech pathologist, so I did a high school internship with a speech pathologist. And I kind of just kept trying to get experience in trying to figure what was next for me. And I always wanted to be in the healthcare world. So once I figured it out, it was good from there."
1524.0,1539.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And you said you're a person who likes to plan out their whole life. Besides your occupation, right, what does that kind of entail or mean to you?"
1539.0,1544.0,Subject,"I mean, I could tell you my life plan. I don't know if I'm going to sound ridiculous. [laughter]"
1544.0,1546.0,Interviewer,"No, not at all."
1546.0,1633.0,Subject,"Okay. So I have five more years of graduate school. Then I'm going to do a two-year postdoc. And so [laughter] I'd like to be married while I'm in graduate school. I don't know when. Because what I've heard is that in graduate school, you have to kind of plan things out very carefully about having a wedding because, obviously, it's a lot of work to have a wedding. And graduate school is very busy, so I don't know when. But I'd like to be married before I graduate. I'd like to have my first child when I'm done with my postdoc. I will be 31, so it sounds fine to me. [laughter] I'm planning on living in New York City through my first child. And then my goal is, when I have my second child, I'll move to the suburbs. I'm from Long Island, and my boyfriend is from New Jersey. So we're thinking Westchester would be a nice in-between for that. [laughter] I don't want to raise my children on Long Island. I had a great childhood. I loved it here, but I just want to go somewhere else. And I probably don't want to be in New Jersey just because it's New Jersey. [laughter] I could probably be convinced to go to New Jersey, but Westchester probably just sounds better to me. "
1633.0,1635.0,Interviewer,New Yorkers really have a hard time with New Jersey.
1635.0,1678.0,Subject,"Yeah. I don't know. My boyfriend doesn't get it. He's like, ""It's a great place."" I mean, his house is great. He lives in a great suburb. There's nothing wrong with it. I don't think I could live in New Jersey. [laughter] Yeah. And like I said, we're trying to get a dog in the fall. The goal is to get a second dog when we move to the suburbs. I'd like three kids total. My boyfriend wants two kids. So that's going to be a conversation, but we have years to come. Let's see. What else is in my life plan? [laughter] I don't know. That's about as far I've gone. I know that's pretty far."
1678.0,1686.0,Interviewer,Yeah That's great. So what do you think makes you want three kids?
1686.0,1702.0,Subject,"So I have one brother, and I always wanted another sibling. I'm the youngest, so I always wanted a younger sibling to have. So I just feel like if I always wanted another sibling, I'd love to give my kids that opportunity."
1702.0,1711.0,Interviewer,Okay. that makes sense. And what makes you want to move to the suburbs once you have two kids?
1711.0,1748.0,Subject,"So I just feel like, with kids, it would be nice for them to have a backyard with maybe a swimming pool and just have more space. I mean, also New York City apartments are so tiny. And I just could imagine that with two kids, I would just want more space. I mean, my parents are the same thing. When they were having me, their second child, they moved to the suburbs. I think that's just a common thing to do, so. Yeah. I wouldn’t want to raise my kids in the city. [inaudible]--"
1748.0,1750.0,Interviewer,"Oh, no. I'm sorry. I think I froze on you. You said you wouldn't want to raise--"
1750.0,1752.0,Subject,"Yeah, [it just froze a sec?]."
1752.0,1755.0,Interviewer,--your kids in the city.
1755.0,1772.0,Subject,"Yeah. I was just saying that it's just a very different childhood to grow up in the city. I mean, I know people who grew up in the city, and they loved it. I'm sure it's great. I mean, the public schools in the suburbs are great. It's where I went to school. Yeah."
1772.0,1783.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And you said you had a great childhood in Long Island. I'm curious what you think you wouldn't want-- why you wouldn't really think of raising your kids there.
1783.0,1798.0,Subject,"Nothing in particular, I just want something new, I guess. I mean, I've lived here my whole life. I just want to go somewhere else. I wouldn't have a problem raising them here. Yeah. I just want something different."
1798.0,1815.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And so you have kind of this life plan. What do you think-- what happens if something kind of doesn’t go according to plan? [laughter]
