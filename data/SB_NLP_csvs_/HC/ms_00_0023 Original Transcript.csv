2.0,21.0,Interviewer,"So first, I just want to thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me. Like I mentioned, our conversation will be recorded. And this interview is going to be a little bit different from other interviews. I really just want to get to know you and what your life is like. So how have things been going for you lately?"
21.0,90.0,Subject,"Good, really busy. So I'm in grad school right now. Let's see. And I'm going into my second year. So I just started an externship. I'm assisting someone with a private practice. Classes start back up in two weeks. And I'm busy in my research lab at school as well. So I'm finding that it's hard to just keep track of everything, each thing that I'm involved in. So I make lots of lists. Hopefully, I'll make it through the next year. I hear this next year is the busiest. But yeah, all good and exciting things. I think, honestly, COVID has helped make New York be a little bit more affordable to live in while I'm in school, so that has been helpful. Yeah. If you want me to share any more of any of that, I can as well."
90.0,96.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what's that been like to kind of be juggling all those different things at this time with the pandemic and everything going on?
96.0,177.0,Subject,"Yeah. Honestly, the pandemic, I feel like, has helped because so much has become more virtual, such as this, but also just other meetings. Sometimes my half-a-day lab work and stuff is remote. My externship is fully in person. I'm starting to see patients in our on-campus clinic, but two out of three of them are remote. So that makes it so much more manageable because commuting to school is about an hour. Commuting to my externship, it's like an hour and a half. So the more that things have been remote, taking out that commute time has allowed me to stay involved in all this. Otherwise, I don't know how people did it with everything being in person. I have no idea. So we are supposed to go in person in two weeks, so we'll see how that goes. I'm a little nervous about just maintaining everything I'm involved in. I'm sure it'll work out, but I'm a little more nervous about that. It's nice to be able to have meetings that are virtual, and I can put them back to back instead of commuting between different places."
177.0,186.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah, definitely. And what of all the responsibilities right now is the one that you're finding the most fulfilling or exciting?"
186.0,316.0,Subject,"That's a great question. So I think my externship I just started, I've been really enjoying. So my class was kind of weird. So I started school last fall, so during the pandemic. So normally, in our program, you start seeing patients in the spring, so this past spring, in our in-house clinic. But because of the pandemic, the class before us continued to see their patients later than they normally would, so I didn't start seeing anyone. And I started my out-of-school externship before I had ever seen anyone, which was pretty nerve-racking. My externship is near Presbyterian in Westchester. And it's on an inpatient unit. And it's technically an affective disorders unit, so mood disorders. But we get just an amalgam of things. So we get substance use, a lot of schizoaffective, so a lot of psychosis. So I felt like I was kind of thrown into the clinical work, which I have more of a research background. So I don't have a degree in psychology, so I was nervous about starting therapy hours and stuff because I had no experience in it. But I'm glad that I started on an inpatient unit. Because it's kind of whatever you can do, you do. And if something goes wrong, you're not going to see that patient next week. Because usually, they're discharged. So it was kind of a good place to start. I'm learning really quickly. It's super fulfilling. You're just trying to make a little progress with each patient each day even if it's just getting up out of bed more, becoming more social on the unit, showering, brushing your teeth, eating more, that kind of thing. So that's been really rewarding and fulfilling, and it's been really insightful to see people in a really acute state."
316.0,338.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So have you felt that kind of helping those patients with maybe the more basic kind of lifetime daily activities has kind of maybe mirrored your kind of entry into the world of clinical psych in a way that has helped the transition for you? Is that kind of what you're saying?
338.0,352.0,Subject,"Oh, that's a great question. So you're saying working with these patients and kind of being in an acute state might be similar to my feelings about starting grad school?"
352.0,359.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. I'm just wondering if you felt that was kind of a parallel for you in some medical [inaudible] way, I guess."
359.0,496.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's a great question. And I honestly had never thought about it that way. But in a lot of ways, yeah, there's absolutely some parallel. As I started grad school, I just have taken so much onto my plate. So I continue to work for the university that I worked for prior to starting this just to keep up an income, which is a lot. So I actually have never seen a therapist long term. But starting this program, I'm feeling a lot of anxiety. It's been a lot trying to maintain everything I'm involved in, so I felt more anxiety than I normally do. I've absolutely been like, ""I should probably see a therapist just to help me manage everything that I'm doing right now."" So yeah, I absolutely can see that. And for me, there's a lot fo just like, ""All right. Stay organized, shower, eat, [laughter] remember those things."" So yeah, I would say that there is some parallels there. And interestingly, I ran a group the other day. We were rating, or I was having them rate how much they believed and how much they experienced [inaudible] and negative beliefs. They turned their back on me, and they were like, ""Oh, if I have to answer this, you should have to answer these too."" So I had an interesting conversation with them where I was like, ""Right now, I'm having a great experience working with this group, and I'm not experiencing a lot of these negative beliefs right now. But I do poorly on a test; I'm going to rate really high on all of these about feeling like a failure and incompetence and stuff like that."" So it was a great conversation with them of like, ""We all experience these depending on what situation you're in, and it varies day to day."""
496.0,516.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. I think that spectrum is always something that can be highlighted in everyone's experience. So could you just tell me a little bit more about what your day to day looks like at the clinic? You mentioned you do some group. Do you do some individual as well? How does that go?
516.0,713.0,Subject,"Yeah. So at the inpatient unit-- let's see. Actually, I'll give you an example. Last Thursday was absolutely crazy. So first, we have 8:30 AM, start morning meeting. It used to be-- prepandemic, I know did they did it in person. Now it's over Zoom. Nurses and the psychiatrist give a rundown of each patient. Then I go on to the unit, and we do morning rounds. So I'm rounding with the psychiatrist and the social worker. The three of us will see each patient for about 15 to 20 minutes, see how they're doing, medication changes. I might find out something about the patient that I could do a one on one with them. Then I might run a group. Right now, I've been running a group on my unit and a different unit. So then, I might go to-- I've been going to a different unit, an all-women unit, running a group over there, CBT. And then, I might go back to my office. Frequently around lunchtime - so that might be around 12:00 - we do a didactics we - that's all virtual - go no Zoom. We just finished a CBT series, so that's an hour. Then I might go back to my unit and either run a group or see two or three people for individual sessions which last about 45 minutes or so. And then sometime in the afternoon, there's usually another didactic series. They've been doing case studies on some women's health stuff. That's been really interesting. And then I'll do an hour of supervision as well and then all my notes. Hopefully, I can get all my notes in. I haven't yet written outpatient notes, which I know are more involved. I mean, it's kind of crazy. I don't feel like I can write anything really long but just making sure I got all those in at the end of the day. And that is a typical day. Oh, and also right now, I've been in charge of giving a MoCA and MADRS for patients who are doing ECT. So we're keeping track of their depression symptoms as well as their cognition each week as they do their ECT treatments for probably a month and a half or so, which has been good. Because I'm minoring in neuropsych. This is my first externship, so I made sure to get one that wasn't fully neuropsych, and I get a lot of therapy experience. But it's nice to bring some assessment in so I can talk about that for my next externship. And ECT is super interesting. So yeah, those have been good."
713.0,725.0,Interviewer,That sounds really cool. So you mentioned for yourself that you've been really liking the kind of remote stuff. But how has that been functioning for the people in the inpatient unit? I donâ€™t have any sense of how that would be for them.
725.0,788.0,Subject,"Yeah. Well, for my externship, that is totally in person. And that's Thursday and Friday, so I go up to Westchester all day those days. But we do some remote things, but none of it's with patients. It's all the didactics, and then our morning meeting is remote. Sometimes supervision will be but not inpatient. I'm similarly interested about that. Because I heard that externs before me, they were doing some stuff with patients, inpatient, remote. I could imagine, especially with patients who are that acute, that would be really difficult. Because I'm finding it challenging even in person with them to get them to be present, and they're very symptomatic in that state. So yeah, I'm glad that I'm not seeing any of them fully remote, but. Yeah."
788.0,795.0,Interviewer,Could you [say?] a little bit more maybe about some of the challenges that you've experienced working this population?
795.0,977.0,Subject,"Yeah. So let's see. So our unit actually, we end up-- I signed up because I am very interested in affective disorders. So that was mainly why I signed up. But come to find out, our unit usually gets sent patients with behavioral problems, so people who might be rowdy and may act out a lot more than others. So it's not quite the depressive unit I pictured, which is interesting but really good because it's so, so, so diverse. And so that has been one of the more surprising aspects of it, and it has come with more challenges. Because I have worked in research in the past a lot with depression and anxiety, so I'm more comfortable with those symptoms even if I haven't done a lot of therapy. But now we have a lot of psychosis. On this unit, we have psychosis, people in withdrawals coming off of drugs - what else was I going to mention? - oh, a lot of mania as well, so a super good experience. But I have not had much experience with this population at all. So I think one of the challenges-- this probably wasn't a good first patient to see, but the first patient I saw comes to mind, mania with some psychosis symptoms. And I'm just like, ""I don't have skills to work with this person right now."" And it was kind of just-- I just came from a curiosity standpoint, asking questions, ""How does this feel? Where are you at?"" I left feeling like I wasn't able to help them much. My supervisor still said, ""You help in just the conversational aspect of it."" But since I've seen some more depressive presentations, which I felt like I've been able to have some more skills to implement. But I still like to challenge myself, ""Okay. Let me see if I could see someone who's manic or has psychosis."" And now I'm starting to just know kind of, I guess, some more questions to ask, especially with psychosis, asking questions about like, ""What is it like for you? And also, how is that possible that--"" for example, some people are having delusions of having certain medical conditions like bone cancer all over their body. ""Wouldnâ€™t that be malpractice if a doctor wasn't telling you this, or you weren't following up with a doctor?"" or just kind of putting some seeds in their mind of questioning that experience for them. So that's been cool."
977.0,1010.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that is really cool. It's really interesting to hear that you kind of actively, in a controlled environment, challenge those delusions a little bit in a way that - I would imagine - helps them a lot as they kind of, hopefully, let those seeds take hold. So that sounds really, really interesting. So going forward, just to shift gears a little bit, do you see yourself working with the anxiety and depression population, or are you really excited by the shift and kind of want to maybe move in the more [psychosisy?] direction? What are you thinking at this point?"
1010.0,1118.0,Subject,"Yeah. I think this is a really good experience, and I put myself on this unit because I wanted acute therapy like, ""Just throw me in."" But I still think I'm leaning towards the neuropsychology path, older adults. I work with older adults. Right now, I'm starting to develop a predoc project, which is on older adults with multiple sclerosis and looking at four different white matter tracts to see if they're associated with apathy in older adults with MS. So yeah, I don't think I'll take the mania, psychosis track even though I'm really glad I'm getting experience in it because I don't have a psychology background or a therapy background. So I think it's a really good experience. It will give a lot of good tools, and I wanted that. I wanted to kind of make sure I got experience in other disorders just because I know anxiety and depression more. But I think I'm going to stay there more. Because I get really passionate about older adults who have cognitive symptoms mixed with mood symptoms. I think I'll stay in my realm, but I want to make sure I'm a confident therapist, and I don't just take the assessment route. Yeah. I feel like I could fall into that, and I want to make sure that I'm confident in therapy. That's another reason why I'm working with someone in a private practice. I'm starting to work with her. I haven't seen any patients yet, but I want to get some good outpatient therapy experience as well just to make sure I'm not closing off any doors for the future."
1118.0,1131.0,Interviewer,"And I know it's early in your program timeline, but do you have a sense at this point - you said your background is a little bit more research oriented - if you want to head fully in the clinical direction or maybe keep kind of one foot in each door?"
1131.0,1225.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's a great question. I think, ideally, my ideal setting would be an academic medical setting where I could do research, but I would see patients for either a neuropsych assessment or therapy. I think I like therapy a day or two a week. I think that would be ideal. I feel like a lot of people feel the same of like, ""I want a mix."" And so I don't know how realistic that is. I'm starting to work with this woman who has a private practice in Manhattan. Having that business side is also attractive, starting a private practice and challenging yourself and having a lot of freedom. But I love research, and I'm in a great lab where I'm getting to work with imaging data. And I have so much more research experience that I think I would take that path first. And then I feel like you could always back off into private practice, where I can't feel like you can't start in private practice and then do the-- and then go into academia. I don't think that would even be possible, or it'd be extremely hard to do. So I think I would try to take the academic route. And then at some point, if I wanted to go fully clinical-- because it's also hard getting grant money. I can only imagine it's grant money dependent and stuff as well, so. Yeah. That's--"
1225.0,1226.0,Interviewer,[That makes?] a lot of sense.
1226.0,1227.0,Subject,I'm thinking.
1227.0,1243.0,Interviewer,"That makes a lot of sense. So thinking about the business side of things a little bit, could you say a little bit more about what you've learned about the business side or what you think that would look like if you haven't learned too much yet?"
1243.0,1446.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's a great question. So I just started working with this psychologist within the past two months, and I've been going over to her apartment just to help her with the logistical side of things just to see how it's run. So far, she's introduced me to the platform that she uses to schedule people, and then she uses a separate platform for insurance. And then she uses a separate platform for notes. So she was the first one to say there's definitely a better way to do this, and I was like, ""There's got to be a better way to do this."" So it's already been super enlightening to see those platforms. But already it gives me a little bit of confidence in thinking, ""All right. I know that I could do what she's doing easily. I think I could be resourceful enough to find a more effective way of doing things."" So that's been helpful and insightful. I think I would do it differently. I haven't gotten into it a lot but just seeing what does billing look like and insurance stuff. So hopefully, I'll get even more insight into that. I've also been helping her with her website, which I'm like, ""Okay. All of this stuff is intimidating, but anyone can do it."" And just with a little bit of exposure, it's enlightening me to, ""Okay. I can go on to Squarespace and make my own website pretty quickly."" But I've never seen myself as a business person per se, so all of that was intimidating, and it took seeing this to be like, ""Okay. I could do this the same way and possibly better or more effective ways."" So those have been the main things we've gotten into. And I know that there's different websites like Headway. And you might even find this interesting. This woman I work with, she's involved with--  it's New York City Health Business Leaders. It's an organization in Manhattan that-- it's a lot of tech start-ups as well as people from academia, and it's a mix of all these psychology and medical field people. I went to a networking event with them and learned so much from them and the resources that are out there, also the mentoring in your own business. So that was fascinating. I met this one guy who is thinking of starting this training program for people getting an MD or PhD-- an MD or PhD in psychology or the health realm and training them on how to get involved in start-ups or starting your own business. And I was like, ""That sounds amazing. Because I don't about other programs, but we get no training in that whatsoever. So long story short, getting involved in all this has been super enlightening. I think there's other paths that I would definitely consider. And just knowing what's out there will help me not close doors. Yeah. So that's been good."
1446.0,1466.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It sounds like you're getting a very well-rounded experience early on, which is really awesome. I mean, you're going to have so many opportunities to just actually figure out what it is that you want to do. And I feel like you'll have a lot of tools to do that, which I just feel like is such a win in terms of the first two years of graduate school, so. That's pretty [inaudible]."
1466.0,1467.0,Subject,Thanks. Thanks.
1467.0,1479.0,Interviewer,"Again, shifting gears just a little bit, could you tell me a little bit about what's been going on outside of the schoolwork craziness, how that's been going for you?"
1479.0,1705.0,Subject,"Yeah, for sure. This is enlightening. This is a therapy session in and of itself. I'm just reflecting on how much I'm taking on. [laughter] So I was living out in Utah. I was working on a cognitive remediation program at the University of Utah before I transitioned here. So I've been continuing to help them out with that. I've been really lucky that my boss out there is great. She developed this program actually from Cornell here in New York. She's starting to disseminate it to other programs, and they're bringing on more sites. I trained Vanderbilt on it right before I entered this program. And now she's bringing in the University of Connecticut. So she's having me go up next weekend to train the University of Connecticut before all my classes start. So that's been a nice [aside?] to stay involved with them, get a little extra money, a little stressful. I don't really have time for it, but she's working with my schedule, so I'm like, ""All right. Fine."" [laughter] I can't say no. So that's been good. Personally, I love running. I love yoga. So while I'm in New York-- I have run a couple of marathons in the past. And since I've been in New York, I forgot that they do this 9 plus 1 entry into the New York City Marathon. I don't know why. I decided this was a good idea, but I was like, ""Well, I'm in New York. I'm going to try to enter the New York City Marathon,"" since you have to be in New York to do the nine local races. So you run nine local races, and you volunteer at one. And then you get an automatic entry into the New York City Marathon. And it's so hard to enter the New York City Marathon. And it's been on my bucket list, and I really want to do it. So Iâ€™m trying to run these nine random races in New York before the year ends and volunteer at one. So this past weekend-- luckily, I live near Central Park, and a lot of them are in Central Park. So I'll go wake up one weekend go run one of those. They're also doing some virtual ones, which help. Just like my workout during the week, I can run three miles, and they'll count towards one of these races. So that's what I've been doing there. Let's see. And then the one other aspect is I am currently dating someone who I live with here. And we're talking about possibly getting married in the spring or in the next two years. [laughter] So we have been together for a while. We met in Boston, and he moved out to Utah with me -  luckily, he works remote - and then moved to New York with me. And we've talked about marriage. Oh, in this program, there's an ideal time to get married, and there's an ideal time to not. So it essentially becomes a little more planned than you would imagine it to be. But I was like, ""Okay. I've heard that the best time to get married is the end of your third year,"" so not this coming spring, but the spring after that. So we're just having initial conversations about when that would be good and planning and where we'd want to have it. He's from Vermont. I'm from Massachusetts. And we have friends out in Utah. So yeah, what would be best for that as well? So those are all the things that have been on my mind lately. [laughter]"
1705.0,1708.0,Interviewer,That is so exciting. Congratulations.
1708.0,1709.0,Subject,Thanks. Thanks.
1709.0,1716.0,Interviewer,So what has that been like to have those conversations with him? Yeah. What has that been like for you?
1716.0,1881.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's been great. This is kind of a funny aside. We met working on an inpatient unit at McClean Hospital up in Boston three years ago. He's been in mental health way more than I have. I essentially was on that inpatient unit for-- it was only like five months to get some clinical experience because I had none. So I went from a neurobio lab into inpatient and back out into research, so it's this quick five-month stint on an inpatient unit where we met. He has a background in psychology, has worked with a lot of children. So we're totally different in that realm. And our personalities match. So he's better at having emotional conversations than I am. And he's extremely supportive, knows me very, very well. And he's been a huge support in all the transitions I've had in this program. I am more of a doer, and he's more of a thinker, so we balance each other out really well in that sense. So he's the one who is really good at having the difficult conversations. And I like having them as well, but I'm not used to it. I'm more of an action-minded person. So that's been really good. He also has things that I've been concerned about in a relationship. Before him, I'd never had a relationship longer than a few months. So it's a big testament to how long we've been together and how well we work together. I think that's been-- it's been huge for me, and I've recognized the benefit of really having someone so stable and like a foundation for me amongst everything that I'm going through. I'm also religious. So I'm Catholic, and that's an important part of my life. And he has also been open to learning more about that, and he's kind of adopted the faith along with me and has kind of made it his own. And he's been supportive in that area of my life, so that has meant a lot, so much. So I think our personalities kind of coming together and being a good pair as well as the religious piece and my values being there, it's exciting to see ourselves kind of long term. And I can see myself having a family and being with him for the rest of my life, which is an exciting thought that I never thought I'd have about someone. [laughter]"
1881.0,1899.0,Interviewer,That is so exciting. Yeah. That's really wonderful. Could you just tell me-- you mentioned this a little bit. Just say a little bit more about how you guys maybe complement each other or support each other within the psychological realm. It's helpful that you guys are both in that same field. So how has that been for you? 
1899.0,2163.0,Subject,"Yeah. It's so fascinating. Yeah. It's been really great. Let's see. So Taylor is very-- let's see. How would I describe him? We're both pretty introverted. Actually, we're both right in the middle. I'm introverted-extrovert spectrum but in different ways. Let's see. I donâ€™t even know where I'm going with this. Different personalities, let's see. So I have a lot of close friends throughout the years, but I'm not someone who will readily make new friends, places that we go, where Taylor is someone who is more outgoing and will readily make new friends. So that's one example of our differences that meld. I react much quicker than he does. So when things are going wrong in my life, I will readily just be like, ""I'm so pissed off, and I'm so angry."" And I'll just put it all out there, where he's more filtered, but he knows, essentially, just listening to me. And he's like, ""All right. You need to go on a run,"" or, ""You need to do yoga,"" or something like that. So he knows what I need, but he's a good sport about taking my anger and emotions when I just put them out there, which I have a tendency to do. The way that he approaches talking about emotions is more he'll say, ""Oh, can I share something with you that's been on my mind."" And then he'll talk about how stressed or anxious or something that he is. But it's fascinating how he doesnâ€™t just throw it out there. He will intentionally have a sit-down conversation with me about it, where I am someone who will just like, ""I don't care what you're doing. I'm going to throw everything out there that I'm thinking about."" Oh, he's really good at asking super good questions. So working with kids, he's been in more of the therapy side of things. He integrates a lot of CBT. He's by no means therapist. But when I'm thinking things through, he's just really good at asking questions about things that I should think about when I'm doing things. Oh, also, he's a really good writer, and I'm not. [laughter] So he will review a lot of my papers and stuff, which is super helpful. Let's see, other psychological differences. He thinks definitely on-- oh, he's like an enneagram for-- he thinks through things a lot, and he thinks really deeply about things. And he can have really deep conversations for an extended period of time, which is interesting. Because I do like going really deep really fast, but then I need to come back out of it, and I need to talk about things that are more superficial. So that's a nice balance where we can have-- we love to laugh, so we can have a lot of fun and go out and have a good time and not go to a deep level. But then we also can sit down and have dinner and dive into something deep and really analyze something about ourselves or something else we're going through, so. Also, along those same lines of just being a good balance for each other, there's so much we love to do together. He grew up ski racing, and I love to snowboard. So it's fun to have someone who equally likes the outdoors and going skiing and going hiking. I drag him on hikes a little bit more. I don't know if he loves hiking, but he'll go with me. But then, he also enjoys being in the city, and we can go have a bottle of wine in Central Park or go have a cocktail or something or go out to dinner. So being able to find someone who appreciates nature but also loves the city, which are two things that I really love and couldnâ€™t see myself only having one or the other, that's huge for me as well, so that's been great."
2163.0,2169.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It's rarer than people think to have somebody who really values both, so yeah."
2169.0,2181.0,Subject,"Yeah. I've always dated one or the other. They love the city, and they're like, ""I don't want to go on a hike,"" or they're a big skier or snowboarder and like, ""You could never bring me to Manhattan."" [laughter]"
