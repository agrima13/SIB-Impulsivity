0.0,4.0,Interviewer,"So the first question I'll ask you is, how--?"
4.0,6.0,Subject,"I had to click a prompt. Okay, sorry."
6.0,12.0,Interviewer,"[No worries?]. Okay. So the first question I'll ask you is, how have things been going for you lately?"
12.0,71.0,Subject,"Good. We've been busy. I'm a PhD student, and I just finished up my second year. So in addition to the end of finals, I'm still in my clinical placements. I'm at the beginning stages of planning a wedding. So that's been very tricky to balance everything, I guess, is the best way that I'll kind of put it. But luckily, I'm pretty good with dividing my time and making lists and all of that stuff. But it's definitely not what I expected. It's a lot more expensive than I thought it was going to be, but we're still at the very beginning stages of just looking stuff up and getting in contact with vendors and getting pricing for stuff. But it's exciting. Yeah. Everything has been pretty good. I'm happy that things have been transitioning back to normal. Yeah, pretty good."
71.0,74.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Congratulations, that's so exciting."
74.0,76.0,Subject,Thank you.
76.0,86.0,Interviewer,"And so what has it been like to kind of try to plan this wedding at the dawn of COVID, hopefully, wrapping up?"
86.0,214.0,Subject,"Yeah. We got engaged last July, so it was still kind of in the midst of everything. And we waited about a month and a half and then looked for a venue and figured things out with the church because my fiancé and I are religious. So we got that done in November, and then I've done nothing since because school got busy for me, and my fiancé is a teacher. So it ended up just being that we did the thing that was going to be the hardest thing to do, I'd say. And now it's just figuring out what exactly we want. So it hasn't been bad because we've been kind of-- we have had kind of a checklist on when we need to do things, so we've had a longer engagement, so being able to do the things that-- contact vendors and all of that-- figure out what we actually want, first off, and then contact vendors. So it hasn't been terrible. Luckily, everyone's been really good with responding to emails even if they weren't able to see people in person. Everyone has an online gallery with some of the photographers and people that we've been speaking to and promotional videos for bands and DJs. So it hasn't been bad. I didn't know that I was going to get engaged. My fiancé kind of threw me off the scent for many-- doctorate. I'll wait until maybe closer towards the end. And it's the end of my first year. But it's been a nice couple of months, figuring out what we both want as well as working with my mom and his mom and asking friends who've gotten married and getting kind of what people think is worse spending money on versus not spending money on, if they have any tips or vendors that they've worked with that they've really liked. So it's been fun. It's been stressful but fun. I need a little-- I'm constantly under a little bit of stress throughout my day to day. So it's nothing new or overwhelming."
214.0,221.0,Interviewer,"Good. And yeah, so what's it been like to work with your mom and his mom?"
221.0,350.0,Subject,"It's been good. My mom and I have a really good relationship and are able to collaborate together. She's a lawyer, so she's very good at being very detail oriented, which I really appreciate. And my future mother-in-law has also been really good with asking around, with friends, and trying to get vendor options and, again, more information. It's mostly been my mom because I don't want to overwhelm my mother-in-law. My future father-in-law's health hasn't been too good the last couple of months, so I've been having her involved to help with a little bit of a distraction, but I don't want it to the point of being overwhelming, so. But my mom has definitely been really good. She jokingly called herself my secretary a couple of days ago. She was like, ""On behalf of my daughter Katie, I am reaching out to contact you."" But yeah, it's been nice to feel like I’m not by myself. And I'm, by all means, not by myself often, as my fiancé is-- I jokingly say he has very strange opinions about things, and you don't know he has a strange opinion about things until you say, ""Oh, do you want a band or a DJ?"" for example. And he is so hell-bent on getting a DJ. And it's like, ""Why do you feel so strongly about getting a DJ?"" And he's like, ""Well, I don't know. Every time I've been to a wedding, the DJs are always really good. You don't have to worry about if someone's cover was going to be as good."" And it was like, ""Why do you have this very strong bizarre, out-of-nowhere opinion about stuff?"" So it's been like, ""Okay. We'll primarily look at DJs. But if we can find a band that's cheaper and is going to be able to play all the songs that we want to play, then what does it really-- what does it really matter?"" No. But it's been good. It's been a nice couple of months of, again, figuring out what we want. There's no harm in [touring?] places, and it's fun, and it's different. How the pandemic has been over the last couple of months, it's been nice to mix it up and distract yourself and be like, ""Oh, let's plan a wedding,"" so."
350.0,370.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, for sure. And so you said he kind of threw you off the scent, but it sounds like you guys have been maybe planning it for a while or at least knew beforehand that you might be together. You might get married."
370.0,493.0,Subject,"Yeah. So we've been together since 2016. We met at a Halloween party through mutual friends. He went to college and graduated a couple of years before my best friend from high school went to the same college, so they had known each other since she was a freshman. A lot of her college friends and a lot of alumni and a lot of-- but it just happened to be that I was at this Halloween party, and he had no idea who I was, and I knew his best friend. So we've been together for a while. And one of the things about our relationship that kind of tested it at the beginning is we met on Halloween, and then I was set to go to Australia the beginning of December for four months for work. So it was like, ""Hi, nice to meet you."" And before the end of the night, he was like, ""I'd really like your phone number. I'd love to take you on a date."" I was like, ""That's so great, but I'm going to be leaving for Australia in a month. So I want to make sure you know."" He's like, ""No, not a problem. We'll go on a date."" So when we talk about it, we were acting so casual and so not serious about it. And neither of us are very casual people [laughter] in terms of dating and all that kind of stuff. But it was very go with the flow. We'll see how things go. And then once I actually got to Australia, we ended up talking twice a day, at least once a day. He'd stay up super late. Yeah, it's really cute. It's stupid cute. Looking back, it's something out of a movie. And a cheesy as that sounds, I knew from the beginning that we were going to-- we were going to be together. So yes, I was thrown off, and I felt that I had more time. I didn’t think that I was going to be planning a wedding in the middle of a pandemic by any stretch of the imagination. But I knew he was my person, and I knew that we were going to be together, so. Yeah. That's our cheesy story."
493.0,494.0,Interviewer,No.
494.0,626.0,Subject,"And the best part of everything is he's so cheesy. Not that I'm not cheesy or that I don't love cheesy, but sometimes he pushes the envelope a little too far, but it's still cute. So we got engaged. We go hiking a lot. I live in Jersey, and he's originally from Jersey as well. And we go hiking a ton, and he proposed on a trail that we've done at least, I'd say, 50 times in the entirety of our relationship. So I, A, had no idea that it was happening and, B, with a place that we've gone so many times that it was no big deal. But he, behind my back, asked my father for permission, went out and got a ring, told all of my friends it was happening. So when we came back from the hike-- it was like a 90-degree day too. I'm absolutely no makeup on, sweating. He had his cousin and his cousin's boyfriend hide in the bushes and take pictures of us as the proposal was happening. And then when the four of us came back to the house, my best friend who introduced us and her husband who's my fiancé's really good friend and a couple of our other friends were social distanced in our backyard and had a little engagement party. It was really cute. So in a way, this has been a really nice kind of distraction from the global pandemic to be engaged and to be planning a wedding. He did a really good job and especially because, again, I had no idea that it was-- And he had no-- and I say this all the time. He didn't seem nervous. He didn't seem distracted. He was just so confident. He was like, ""Why was I going to be worried? You were going to say yes anyway."" So it's like, ""That's a good point. I'm not going to say no."" And we jokingly say that I don't even remember saying yes or not. I just remember saying, ""Stop. This isn't funny. Don't joke about this."" And then I blacked out, [laughter] so. Yeah. But it's been a really good year with everything going on and, again, a nice distraction from everything. Yeah."
626.0,638.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's so so sweet. And you said you kind of knew from the beginning. What do you think made you know?
638.0,785.0,Subject,"He is one of those people that you could-- for example - this happened literally last week - a friend of ours is moving. No one else is available. What does my fiancé do? He leaves school early to go help a friend move. He's the most selfless person. He'll drop anything to help other people. And it's funny in terms of our compatibility that I am so far type A. I'm not saying that he's type B or whatever you want to call it because he does have type A tendencies, but we do a nice blend together. He's very spontaneous. I'm very organized and kind of planning. But he really does balance me out and really checks me when I am being too much of a planner, and I check I check him. And it's been really good in terms of communication from the beginning of our relationship. Most people, after meeting someone and going on two dates before you go to another country, would stay up or get up super early to talk to you. And that for me was like, ""This guy is actually not only worth my time but really cares about me and wants to get to know me even though I'm halfway around the world. And he comes from a really nice family, really super sweet, and supportive. And he has a couple of nieces and nephews. And it was maybe two months or three months after I came back from Australia, so relatively early in our relationship. And they were already calling me aunt. And it was the most-- and I've dated people that have had older siblings that have had kids, but I've never been called an aunt before. So it was very kind of automatic that it is was like, ""Oh."" And we just clicked. And it's like there's no-- So it's been really, again, easy. And I haven't had to overthink things, and I've known that he's been committed and wanting to have a future with me. And it's been really nice to not have to worry about one area of my life or overthink things. I know he's always going to be there and be very supportive and help me with grad-school-related stress or clinicals or anything like that. He's been really good with-- he doesn't understand half of the stuff that I do [laughter] or study, but he's really good at being supportive."
785.0,800.0,Interviewer,That's wonderful. And you said that he can kind of help alleviate some of the stress in the other parts of your life. And it sounds like maybe school is one of those. But what are those other stressors like for you?
800.0,955.0,Subject,"A lot of it is just getting in my own head that sometimes it's-- I've gotten better. I wouldn't call it yet procrastinating. But I like to plan and then not necessarily execute as quickly as I probably should. I've gotten better over the last year. The first year of grad school is always an adjustment. So he's been really good at kind of making sure that I'm taking time for myself, and I'm not just sitting in front of the computer for the majority of the day, that I'm going out and doing things and hanging out with friends and making sure, especially now that I'm seeing clients, that I'm pouring from a cup that's not empty. So he's really good at kind of helping me monitor myself and have fun and not stress about things because I like to plan ahead and know kind of what my schedule and my day looks like, and he's really good at being like, ""Well, why not just do something different or mix it up?"" So I've gotten a lot better at kind of embracing-- and not that I have panic attacks or anything crazy when things don't go according to plan, I'm not that extreme of a type A personality. But kind of embracing-- he really embraces the spontaneity and the kind of go with the flow of life. And again, not that I'm not able to kind of adapt, but he sees this joy that I've only really started to see toward the last two years of our relationship that it's great to just kind of go and do whatever. And we'll go on vacation sometimes, pre-pandemic. And he'll just be like, ""Let's not make a reservation somewhere. Let's just walk down."" And for me, I want to look at the reviews. I want to know what people say or whatever. And he's like, ""Let's just go with the flow."" And it's been really-- there are some times we need to balance, that I need to check him and be like, ""Well, we want a place that's good. So how about I find five places that are good, and then we can kind of determine while we're there what--"" so it's been a nice kind of blend of both of us. But he's been really good at kind of stopping me before I go. I jokingly call it apocalypse planning. It's like I have a plan A, and I have plan B, and I have a plan C. And he's like, ""What's the likelihood that you're going to use any plan other than plan A?"" That's a very good point. Yeah. But we're a good balance of each other."
955.0,965.0,Interviewer,Yeah. It sounds like it. Have you always been a planner?
965.0,1046.0,Subject,"I jokingly say that I'm a nice blend of my mother and my father in terms of my ability to plan. My father is very go with the flow, not a big planner. And my mother is a corporate lawyer like I needed to be. I've definitely gotten, again, better at kind of embracing spontaneity, but I've always liked to be organized and kind of know where things are and plan ahead and be able to kind of anticipate different things. But I don't think it's to the level of anywhere near my mother, which is why planning a wedding is great for her. She's retired, so this is like exercising a muscle that she hasn't been able to exercise in a while. But yeah, I've always liked to be organized, especially in terms of schoolwork and work-related stuff. Outside of that, I'm not as, I think, kind of-- strict is not the right word, but it's the word that's coming to mind but not as, I guess, compartmentalized. I'm definitely a more relaxed person when I'm not a PhD student. But yeah, in some capacity, I've always been a little organized in things."
1046.0,1053.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And what do you find unrelaxing about being a PhD student?
1053.0,1232.0,Subject,"Well, [laughter] the first thing that comes to mind is the fact that it's COVID and the fact that we-- the timing of everything. We were supposed to start seeing in-person psychotherapy patients at about the time that we all transitioned online. So then that was delayed. So not that it was unorganized or, again, that I wasn't able to adapt, but you set these expectations, and you go through trainings and all the stuff. And then it's like, ""Now here's another training and another Word document you have to read about. Now we're transitioning to a HIPAA-compliant video chat, and you can't record it, so you can't go over it with your supervisor. So you're seeing patients for the first time and not able to go with your supervisor and see whether or not you're providing the kind of therapy that you anticipated or have been prepping for for a year."" Yeah. So it's things like that when things don't go according to plan. Again, in my adulthood, I've gotten a lot better with being-- me stressing out about something is not going to benefit the situation at all. It's just going to make me feel worse, so acknowledging that this is the emotion I'm feeling and then just moving on, very act and mindfulness-based. I'm grateful that I have a pretty steady yoga practice, and I did that before I decided I wanted to go into clinical psychology. So it's been nice to be able to have that myself and be able to recognize when patients need that because I have found it personally very helpful when things don't go, again, this year, according to plan. And sometimes, too, it's just dealing with bureaucracy within the university. I have a student leadership position. So it's dealing with, ""Oh, this is the person you need to talk to. This is the person you need to talk to,"" and those types of things that you would think that-- we make a joke all the time. You would think a bunch of psychologists would be able to anticipate people's emotional needs and do things in a more streamlined method. But being that everyone's human and every one has their own things they need to do and stuff that happen, so again, taking a step back when thing don't go according to plan and regrouping and not taking it personally when someone doesn't respond to your email for longer than it should be, stuff like that. But it's nothing horrible, terrible, no point in my so far that I've wanted to quit or give up. I've worked too hard to get to this point. That's what I always keep saying. ""It's not that big of a deal. This is what you wanted, and it comes with the territory and comes with this kind of work, so."" Yeah."
1232.0,1240.0,Interviewer,So what's something that made you close to wanting to quit?
1240.0,1419.0,Subject,"There hasn't been anything that's been like, ""Oh my gosh, it's a real thing."" There have been things that have been annoying or things that-- for example, before I started my PhD, I did neuropsych testing. I was a psychometrist at a outpatient memory clinic. And so we had a class that was our cognitive assessment course, and I knew all the tests way too well. [laughter] And there were things that-- because I had been trained with older adults doing mainly dementia diagnoses or differential diagnoses. The ways were presented in a very general sense, and it made it hard for people to kind of grasp on to real-world applications of some of these assessments. So there are things that were more annoying or not the way that I would have approached it if [I were in?] my-- it was basically the TAs; they were not faculty members - that I would have maybe done differently to make it a little bit more digestible. Because then, what ended up happening is because people knew that I knew some of the tests, I would kind of get phone calls after class like, ""Can I ask you a question about--"" and it's like, ""I'm not a TA, and I'm not a faculty member. And yes, of course, I will help you."" I'm not going to say no to helping someone out because you never know when they'll be able to help you. But there are some times that it was just like, ""If it was just done in a way that kind of stuck to people more and was explained maybe in a more--"" yeah. And again, annoyance is never to the point where I'm actually legitimately thinking about quitting, which has been good. In fact, it's been two years and through a global pandemic, and I haven't had the thought really stick in my head. It's just more that sometimes I felt like - because you apply to a bunch of different places - ""Well, what if I had gone to this school instead?"" or, ""What if I had decided not to do a PhD and do a PsyD?"" or, ""What if I--"" playing that kind of what-if game. But it's never to the point where I'm like, ""No. I need to leave this,"" or, ""This is not what I want."" I haven't really done that, though. I feel like after you get through your first year, you're like, ""I can get through anything."" [laughter] And then there's a global pandemic. So at this point, I haven't thought about whether or not I would-- what would happen if I was in a different school or a different lab within the school or stuff like that? I've been too busy to kind of spend time thinking about what-ifs. But yeah."
1419.0,1430.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So how did you make the decision to join this program or even do, I presume, clinical psych?"
1430.0,1785.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I knew from my-- I think it was my sophomore or my junior year of high school that I wanted to study psychology. My high school had the option that you could have two-marking-period-long courses instead of electives that were just one marking period. So I took a sociology course and a psychology course. And I absolutely hated sociology. I would get into fights with my professor all the time because he would make these global statements about groups of people. And of course, it's sociology, and things are very interesting, but my brain could not [compute?]. And then the teacher for the psychology course went through a whole thing about sleep hygiene and how sleep is really important. And we did some personality disorders in that course, and I was 15, 16 years old, and it was like, ""This so fascinating. And wouldn't this be so cool for me to continue to learn about this and be able to figure out what exactly I wanted to do in the field?"" It was very general. I liked everything about psychology. So I went and got my bachelor's of science in psychology and studied kind of an array of different things. I was in a Head Start program helping with underprivileged families in Bridgeport, Connecticut. And then I went and worked a semester at Yale in their prodromal schizophrenia lab, so I got to work with 16-year-olds that were going through their first psychosis. I worked with schizotypal personality disorder patients at Mount Sinai. So I kind of tried to get exposure to everything. And one of the things that I've now accepted that this is just a part of who I am, I was fascinated by everything. So then, it was very hard for me to kind of focus and say, ""What do I actually want to do?"" And so I then decided that I was going to go back into research eventually. So right after college, I thought that I wanted to be a school psychologist just because I had done a lot of stuff with Head Start. So I worked for about a year and half. And it's one of the reasons why I went to Australia. I was working as a ABA therapist, working under BCBAs for children 18 months to five years who either were diagnosed or had learning delays or disabilities. And I had an extreme burnout, I'd call it. Because it was just-- it had nothing to do with the work. It had nothing to do with the kids. It was just dealing with parents that felt like they had a PhD because they Googled something the night before or dealing with districts that really-- the main reason the kid couldn’t get services is because of budget purposes. And it was just heartbreaking. And it was just like, ""I need to go back into research,"" because that's what I did, a lot of research, in my undergraduate. So I was like, ""Let me go back into research, just get a job in any kind of research and figure out what I want to do from there."" So I ended up in an Alzheimer's disease research lab in Rockland County, New York. And it was the first time I've ever done neuropsych testing. I just fell in love with it. The fact that a test could-- was like, ""This is so cool, the fact that I can figure out people's processes and how they think about things. And I could observe them doing things, and they could tell me about how their networks work."" And it was just like, ""This is so cool."" And so I now jokingly say that I went from loving these little kids to loving these big kids. Because once people start to develop the later stages of Alzheimer's disease, they're just happy kids in 80-, 90-year-old bodies. So I really like a lot of my research in my PhD, and the lab I work in is all aging and some gait stuff too. So that's been really nice to be able to actually learn about neuroanatomy and kind of connect all these things that I've enjoyed and loved for a while. But I definitely fell into this. It was not something that I-- 16-year-old me didn’t say, ""I'm going to work with dementia patients one day."" It's been really nice, and I've really enjoyed it. And it not only helped me kind of connect the dots, but it ended up being that my grandfather was diagnosed with dementia two years ago, so I knew a lot. Again, my future father-in-law had a stroke. So I'm working in a inpatient rehabilitation hospital here in New Jersey on the traumatic brain injury floor, so I know all the terminology for strokes and stuff. And the timing of everything and I know what to ask and how to advocate has been really great timing in terms of everything. So it's validation from the universe that it's like, ""You're in the right-- [laughter] you're in the right thing."" And it's like psychology is this massive puzzle, and the puzzle are people, and it's just so great. Everything that I've done in terms of the clinical work has been validating in terms of-- so that's a lot louder than the, ""You should quit,"" or, ""This is annoying,"" But it's like, ""This is such an amazing opportunity to get to learn and experience these things and get to work with these people and learn about people, so. Yeah. No, I definitely caught the bug. I caught the general psych bug early, but I'm happy that I've kind of fallen into this niche. Yeah."
1785.0,1793.0,Interviewer,Absolutely. And so how do you see yourself using all of these things moving forward even after your program?
1793.0,1936.0,Subject,"So I definitely want to go and get my neuropsychology license. Other than that, [that's?] really too early to know because I really like working in inpatient. I really like doing assessments in outpatient. And I know some of my supervisors that kind of do both of those things have a private practice and work full time in an inpatient hospital and teach. There's a flexibility which I really like. And one of the reasons I initially liked psychology is you can do so many different things with it. So the fact that I'm doing sleep hygiene work, which is more like health psychology-- my program is kind oriented in health psychology, but then I'm doing that with traumatic brain individuals or people that have been diagnosed with dementia. It's kind of a mixture of a bunch of different things. So I think it'll really depend on how kind of my personal life develops. I know that I've gotten feedback from some supervisors and professors that it's nice to have kind of a set schedule when you start to have kids and that type of stuff. So maybe working in a hospital may not be the best for when you have kids, maybe when the kids are older, so stuff like that I'm flexible. I've only had one doctoral-level training opportunity so far other than seeing the clients also through our clinic at school. I don't want to make the decision too early and then miss an opportunity. So I'm very much open to-- And I used to feel bad about not knowing exactly. I have some cohort members that are like, ""Oh, I want to work in child inpatient."" And it's like, ""Great. I'm so happy that you've made a decision already."" But I feel like it kind of, again, shuts you off to different opportunities that I didn't think that I was-- if you had told me again two years ago that I'd be in a rehab unit, I would be like, ""But you really like dementia patients. Why are you not doing dementia stuff?"" And it's like, ""But this is a great learning opportunity, and I now know how to speak doctor, which is great,"" [laughter] again, skillsets that I didn't think that I would know. Yeah. So I know I want to definitely get licensed. But other than that, I'm kind of open to everything."
1936.0,1937.0,Interviewer,Cool.
