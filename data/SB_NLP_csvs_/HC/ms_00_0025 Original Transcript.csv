3.0,7.0,Interviewer,
7.0,22.0,Subject,"Things have been going well overall. I don't know. I'm happy. I have stressors, but generally things are going well."
22.0,29.0,Interviewer,Great. And what are the stressors like for you?
29.0,71.0,Subject,"So I'm a doctorate student, so I have school stressors and research stressors, sometimes feeling overwhelmed, sometimes not having enough time to do all the things I need to do, or just having a lot to do so it's a lot to keep track of. And then I am also a student living in Manhattan, so the living situation. I'm coming to the end of the lease, so I'm dealing with figuring out if I'm getting a new apartment or if I need new roommates or how all of that's going to go. So those are the types of things that are going on in my life right now."
71.0,84.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Wow. That's a lot. So what is it like to kind of wonder what your living situation will be?
84.0,185.0,Subject,"So that's been kind of scary. I've lived at this apartment for three years, and I was hoping to not leave. I love the neighborhood and the location. So the fact that come August 1st I don't know if I am going to be in a new apartment or a new neighborhood or am going to have new roommates is definitely kind of scary. It's something that I feel like I've been trying to figure out for a long time now because my current roommate situation has been in flux a lot this past year with the pandemic and all that. So that's something that has been on my mind and I knew has been coming. And it's been one of those things, where in New York you can't really plan ahead for apartments. When you find an apartment, you have to basically sign right then and there. So planning two months in advance, it's just not really something that New York apartment leasers are really set up to do. So it's just this constant process of trying to find things out, and then basically finding out that you can't do anything about it yet. And my current lease, the management here has just been horrible. I can't get a hold of anyone. So it's just been a lot. I've spoken to three different people, and they all kind of just keep passing the buck, like, ""Oh, I can't help you. You have to talk to that person."" Well, that person is not answering their phone, so I can't speak to anyone. It's just endless. So it's not fun. Especially I'm kind of a planner, so not having a plan is just one of those things that just bothers me in general."
185.0,194.0,Interviewer,Absolutely. And so you said you're a planner. What does that kind of look like or feel like to you?
194.0,271.0,Subject,"I honestly like to-- that's how I like to spend my time doing things. It makes me feel productive. It makes me feel excited about whatever I'm planning for, whether it's schoolwork, I like to plan out my week of what I need to do for the week for school work. Whether I do it all or not is a different question, but I enjoy the planning process. I'm very social, so planning visits to friends or friends to come visit me, even just planning vacations or trips, I like to be part of that process and I just think it's a fun thing to do. But also having the plan makes me feel less anxious about whatever is coming because then I know a little bit more what to expect. I can be prepared. I can pack. I can make sure that when the day comes I'm not anxious or stressed about it because I already know what's coming. So I think that would be true for anyone, especially about a living situation. I think even people who don't plan, that comes into play. No one likes to not know where they're going to be living next month. So that's kind of what I mean when I say I'm a planner."
271.0,285.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. And so can you describe a time when you haven't planned and what that was like?
285.0,286.0,Subject,A time when I haven't planned?
286.0,337.0,Interviewer,When you couldn't plan. We're back. 
337.0,382.0,Subject,"So I was struggling to find an example of a time when I couldn't plan, and this current apartment situation is the only example I think I have where I've really tried to make a plan and just literally just cannot because it's kind of out of my hands. Right? I can't make people give me a lease or become my roommate or tell me the future, type thing. But otherwise, I think the way I manage it is I'll just plan to not plan. So if I know that I can't plan, then I will just plan on going with the flow. And to me, that's enough of a plan, and that's okay."
382.0,405.0,Interviewer,Cool. And so it is very-- housing recently has been crazy because of the pandemic. So what has it been like to kind of lose-- so what happened with your roommates? You said that they were kind of in and out because of the pandemic. What does that mean?
405.0,618.0,Subject,"Yeah. So, oh, my gosh, well, let's go back full story. So I have two roommates. I'm in a three-bedroom apartment, I have two roommates. And the two of us have lived here for three years, and we know each other because we're both from the same hometown. So my best friend is her cousin. That's why we're roommates. And then the third one is just a random person that we got off of Craigslist to fill the room. And she actually lived with us a whole year, so she had just re-signed the lease in August. Then by October she informed our leasing manager that she was leaving, that she was moving back to her home country, and that she was not paying rent. But she didn't tell me and my roommate that. She just told the manager that. So we were kind of left in the lurch, working with the management company to see how we were going to manage paying rent without a third roommate, what options could they offer us, could they move us to a different unit, could they just reduce our rent, could we get a new third person in to sublet, to fill the room so we could keep paying rent. That's what we were dealing with in August. So management told us they would just reduce the rent, which was still more than the two of us could afford because it still wasn't like a third of the reduction, if that makes any sense.  So we still needed to get a sub-letter, a third person. But we couldn't get a third person at the normal rent rate because in the fall rent was just so low in New York because no one was living here. So we couldn't get anyone to let the room when rent was so low. It just wasn't a competitive price basically. So we sublet the room at the reduced rate, which is what we were told we would be allowed to pay. So we've had a new sub-letter his whole time, but a few weeks ago, and she had agreed to stay until the end of August, which is the end of the lease. And then a few weeks ago she let us know that she needed to leave a month and a half early. So there is nothing really we could do about that. She didn't sign a contract. We're lucky that we had anyone at all. So it's fine. But that's just kind of been the in and out of roommate situation. So now, at the end of the lease, we obviously need to find a new person.  The other roommate is also not planning on re-signing the lease, so it's just me. So I need to find two people. But now I'm also trying to find a new person to move in early so that we can cover that third person's room who is leaving early. So it's just kind of all in flux. And then the management company, they told us they would reduce the rent. So we've been paying a reduced rent, but they never actually reduced the rent. So now they're telling us that we owe them all this money that we don't have because we were told it could be reduced. So I'm not allowed to re-sign the lease if there is this balance. So now I'm like, ""Okay, well if I can't get a hold of you to figure out if you're going to waive the balance or not, I can't re-sign if you're not going to waive the balance."" So I'm looking for two new roommates to fill this apartment, because I would like to stay here, but also looking for a new apartment in case I need to just move out. So--"
618.0,622.0,Interviewer,Wow.
622.0,653.0,Subject,"Yeah. So it's been a lot just to kind of have hanging over my head. And again, that's the whole planning piece, because most of this is just not in my control. So I'm trying to come up with like, ""Okay, this is my plan if I can stay in this apartment. And then this is my plan if I have to move out of this apartment."" But even then, both of those plans, I can't do anything about it. I can just have it in my head, so I feel like, ""Okay, I'm going to be okay. I'm all right because I have a plan."""
653.0,658.0,Interviewer,"Right. You have a plan either way, neither one you can control. Yeah."
658.0,660.0,Subject,[crosstalk]. Yeah.
660.0,679.0,Interviewer,Wow. So that is a pretty rough situation. So what is it like to balance all of this with-- you said you're in a doctorate program. That seems like a lot to kind of juggle at once.
679.0,757.0,Subject,"Yeah, it's definitely a lot to juggle, especially on days-- because this apartment stuff, it just kind of comes up. And so again, I'm working from home a lot. My time is fairly unstructured. So it's up to me to structure my day. And so I plan on doing X, Y, and Z of typically schoolwork or I see patients to have sessions scheduled. But then something will come up for the apartment where whether it needs my attention or not, it will get my attention because it's a stressor. Right? So then I have derailed and I spend an hour or two hour looking for apartments or creating an ad for the room or talking to my roommate to figure out whatever we need to figure out. And so that kind of gets in the way of my getting through my schoolwork, which then I stress about not having enough of my schoolwork done. So it's not totally a dire situation. It just definitely is an added element of stress and complication that I was not anticipating having. "
757.0,767.0,Interviewer,Yeah. And so you said you see patients. What kind of degree program are you doing?
767.0,974.0,Subject,"I'm in a clinical psychology program with a neuropsyc emphasis. So I'm going into my fourth year. I will be in it for five years total, not including internship and post doc. So I see we do something called an externship. We do one every year, which is approximately two days a week. It's supposed to be 16 hours a week for a one-year experience working with a licensed clinician, seeing patients, writing reports. Seeing patients, what that means depends on your focus. My focus is clinical neuropsychology, so I am working typically with a clinical neuropsychologist. And what patient care looks like in that realm is that it's mostly assessment. So you would see a clinical neuropsychologist. You take your parents there if you think their memory is weird and you're worried about dementia. If you have a stroke you would typically see a neuropsychologist afterwards, a few months afterwards, to see what they think is working and not working cognitively. You would see a clinical neuropsychologist if you think your child has ADHD or maybe autism or you just feel like your thinking skills are off. If you had cancer and you feel like you have chemo brain that's not resolving, you might see a clinical neuropsychologist. So it's assessment.  So when I see patients it's typically an hour to an hour and a half of interview where the person that I'm working with takes the lead and you learn all about their history, and then you do anywhere from two-- it can be like two to eight hours of testing. Sometimes you break it up where I just walk people through different thinking tasks. And then afterwards you score it up and then you write a report. So during the pandemic it's been much more reduced. I've had a lot fewer patient hours because it's all virtual. I haven't been in person with a patient in a long time. So the batteries are short so that we just can't do as many things in this format. So that's what seeing patients is like for me.  For in the summer, I picked up an additional externship experience that's just through the course of a summer, and it's one day a week instead of two, just because I don't have enough days in the week to do a full one. And that's in person, and it's been interesting. I've actually been going to Long Island. So once a week I go up to Long Island for a day. It'll be like doing the interview and the testing, and then maybe in the morning we'll have a feedback session which is where you give the patient your interpretation of the results and recommendations. But that's just through the summer, typically, you don't do two because it can be a lot. But I felt I was concerned about my hours after the pandemic kind of decimated how many hours I was getting. So I'm trying to augment those this way."
974.0,983.0,Interviewer,Sure.  And how has it been to try to transition back into in-person work?
983.0,1087.0,Subject,"I think it's been good. I was vaccinated back in February. I never got COVID. I have not been one of those people. I mean I've been careful. I was quarantining. I didn't travel. I was [inaudible], but I wasn't one of those people who was very anxious. When I was in the supermarket I was masked and I washed my hands when I got home, and I was fine. I wasn't like one of those-- I know some people who were stressing and anxious about anything. I've not been that way this whole time. And I think at this point, over a year into this I'm getting to that point where I'm just like, ""All right. I'm over it."" So it's just good to be around people again. It's easier to see patients, be in the same room with them. It's easier to make sense of what they're saying, to get an understanding of them, to get a read on them. And it's also just been good to be back. So I'm in a hospital, so I interact with people, and you get more of that interdisciplinary training because I'm not just sitting at my desk zooming with my supervisor. I can shadow the attending or I sit in on case conferences where you hear different attendings give their reports, which just gives you a more well-rounded experience. So I'm excited about that. And I start a new one in July. I transition from my current virtual experience into a-- I'm just going into a different placement in July. So that will also be in person. So I'll be in person three days a week starting July, which I'm excited about."
1087.0,1102.0,Interviewer,Cool. That's so interesting that you said you kind of get more of a read on people in person. What do you think that is due to?
1102.0,1258.0,Subject,"Well, first of all, just visibly you can see more. Like for example, right now you and I can only see shoulder up. You can't see if I'm fidgeting or bouncing my knee. Or maybe if I'm looking around the room you don't know if it's because my cat's over there or if it's just I'm uncomfortable making eye contact. I can't get a read on eye contact basically at all, because no matter where you're looking, I'm not sure if you're actually looking at my face. So that more subtle stuff of-- because that helps you understand, oh, this person just seemed anxious. Right? Or this person seemed uncomfortable. That's something you would note if you sat with your patient for four hours and they didn't look you in the eye once. That's something you would notice. Whereas here, that could be happening and I just would never know.  Or also, it's hard-- so in neuropsyc it's hard. And it's actually been controversial throughout the pandemic, because the way you do testing, it's extremely standardized. Because the idea is you're supposed to be in a standardized environment. So it's a quiet room, low distractions. If I'm trying to see if you have an attention problem, I don't want you to be in the room where your laundry machine is beeping and your cat's jumping in your desk. I want you to be in a quiet room, free of distractions. And I want everyone who takes the test to be in that same type of environment. And we just can't do that anymore virtually. Because everyone's at home and not everyone has a quiet room that they can sit in with no distractions. So that can complicate the way that we interpret tests. Again, if I'm doing a test of attention and you miss an item, if I'm in the same room with you, and I heard that, oh, someone just knocked on the door, I could say like, ""Okay--"" I would make a note of that, and that would affect how I would interpret that person's behavior. Whereas, if I can't see everything that's going on in the room, I don't know if there was a specific reason why they did something. And a lot of the stuff we do, if we time it, there can be a lag. So if I say, ""It took you three seconds to give me this answer,"" but really there was a lag and it only took you one second, that just effects."
1258.0,1277.0,Interviewer,Interesting. So that does seem like in person would definitely really matter. So I'm curious what kind of brought you to studying neuro psychology and what kind of made you want to go into that kind of sub field.
1277.0,1427.0,Subject,"It was a professor I had in under grad, he was-- first of all, I'm convinced he's one of the smartest people I've ever met. So that just attracts you to whatever. I'm like, 'Well, whatever he's doing sounds cool."" And then he also always had the coolest stories about patients. And I was like-- so that again was like, I had done, you could call it an internship in under grad at a outpatient community clinic, which is basically just like a therapist, a therapy office. There was psychologists, clinical social workers, psychiatrist. So I just saw the mundane, every day, the same patients come in every week. They say they're depressed. A whole career of that didn't seem very exciting to me. Especially the more you learn about it, you just learn that anxiety and depression is going to be the most common type of therapy patient you see, and those aren’t things that you just cure and resolve and go away. That something you just kind of work through just like you just keep working. So to me, that seemed like an easy career to get into that would just burn you out or just not be very fulfilling.  So this idea of you would see a new patient-- the patients you see in clinical neuropsychology, it's like a puzzle that you try-- they come in with this problem. You learn everything you can about them. You tell them whatever answers you can come up with, and then they're on their way. So it's a puzzle every time. And the way you do that, is you just develop this expertise and understanding, like brain-behavior relationships. So I just think that it's almost like magic. If I see that this person tends to have this behavior, I can make an inference about what's going on in their brain, neurologically. And I just think that's really-- I think that's really cool. Obviously, the actual, quote-unquote ""hard sciences"" is cool too. I can take a picture of your brain or use MRIs and stuff like that. That's cool too, but this is just a more human-connection way to do it, I think. That's what attracted me to it."
1427.0,1455.0,Interviewer,Awesome. That does sound really cool that you can kind of map things to the physical. And so you're in your fourth year. That's very exciting. Do you have any idea what you would like to do moving forward after your program? You mentioned you have internship and post doc and a lot of things in the future to come.
1455.0,1595.0,Subject,"Yeah. So as much as I just kind of pooh-poohed the whole therapy aspect, throughout training clinical psychology you get trained as a clinician. So I do still get the training in therapy and psychotherapy. And I actually did end up liking that a lot more than I thought I would. So I'm hoping that within my career I can incorporate some aspect of therapy. I mean okay, I guess, short term, in response to your question: It's one more year at this-- fourth year, fifth year, two more years at this program and then one year internship and two years of post doc, and then the question for anyone kind of on that track is do they want to be an academic? Do they want to be a researcher? Do they want to be a clinician? Do they want to teach, or what combination? And so what attracted me to the PhD route is that I have those options. Whereas from what I understand a Sc.D your options are slightly more limited in terms of less academic research positions. I do think that that is changing. So I would like that-- I like the idea of flexibility in my career long term that I could maybe start out more heavy on the research and then transition into clinical work or vice versa, or attempt some balance of the two throughout. I like the idea of-- the longer I'm in the program the more I see myself less as a researcher and more as a clinician. I have experience teaching and I know that I really like that. It's a super gratifying thing to do. So I would like to incorporate that into my career in some way, whether that's training clinicians, like supervising them, or teaching in a classroom. So to me, I think that would put me ideally in a teaching hospital, maybe with some private practice. But I don't think I could manage private practice solely because I have no understanding of how to run my own business. And that is required if you have your own private practice, so--"
1595.0,1608.0,Interviewer,It's interesting. It sounds like teaching is something that you're interested in. How did you come to know that that's something that you liked?
1608.0,1758.0,Subject,"As an undergraduate student-- no, I don't think-- that just kind of struck me as an odd thing, but I did this as an undergrad. But as an undergrad student I was in a research lab and my research PI was going away on conference, and she basically just asked me to give a lecture. So I filled in for her and gave her lecture. So that was my first teaching experience. But then as an undergrad I was also a tutor. And so that was really where I got that taste of wow, feels really good to have someone come to you and be struggling and it's something that you know. So you can explain it and you can just see the light bulbs go off in their heads, and they're like, ""Oh, I get it."" And that feels really good to know that oh, I explained something and now that person understands this thing that I remember I struggled to learn, and now I was able to teach it."" That just feels really good.  Then as I did a master's program and in that I was a TA, so I actually taught a statistics lab, which was a lot of the same stuff. No one likes statistics. Okay, most people don't like statistics. It can be really hard to learn. And it's an undergrad 101 stats course. It's a required course. So as much as stats could be the toughest thing to teach for those reasons, it also makes it that much more gratifying when you get the people who do understand it. And then after my graduate program I was an adjunct for that same stats class for a few sections. And it was a-- so I have enough of the experience that I know it just feels really good to teach people things. I don't know that I-- I think I'm shying away from the academic route because I know the realities of just teaching in a classroom every day also comes with its own trials and tribulations. So that's why I'm not sure if I just wanted that supervisor route where you teach someone in real life in the room with the patient, rather than a classroom of 40 students who have to read the chapter and take a test. It's different type of teaching style."
1758.0,1781.0,Interviewer,"Right. Yeah, definitely. Do you think it's a trade off? Or do you think you could do both in academia? Would you be able to also have some of those more intimate settings or--?"
1781.0,1915.0,Subject,"I think that in academia it's-- it depends on the person. I think for most people it is a trade off, because academia, once you get into that role, you have to teach a certain number of courses. You have to have a number of office hours. A lot of times, if you're on the tenure track, you have to publish so many publications with and without students. And all of those things take time. So to be able to do any or all of that, it really limits your ability to practice. So I had one professor in undergrad who saw patients once or twice a week while he was also on tenure track faculty. But I don't think-- I think since I was in that program I think he left ,and I don't know why. But none of the other professors there even attempted that. I think that it's possible to kind of hit that trifecta of doing all, teaching, practice, research. But I do think that happens typically much later in your career. So for example, you're not a tenure track. You've already been tenured. You're not trying to proof yourself at your university, or maybe you are primarily a practitioner and you just have an adjunct position, so you just teach one class a week. But I think that's part of why it's important to be intentional and think about what I want, because it does feel like you have to pick that academia, teach in a classroom, or be a clinician practitioner and accept extern students where you'd be supervising them. It does seem hard. I don't know people who really do both unless they're senior faculty who just don't teach as much. I don't know. To me, it seems like you do pick one or the other."
