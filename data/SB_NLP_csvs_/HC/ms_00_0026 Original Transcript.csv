0.0,2.0,Interviewer,Recording in progress.
2.0,25.0,Subject,"Okay. So I'd just like to thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me. Like I mentioned, our conversation would be recorded. And this interview is a little bit different from maybe other interviews that you've had in the past, but really, the main point is just to kind of get to know you, get to know what your life is like. And so let's just get started. So how has things been going for you lately?"
25.0,85.0,Interviewer,"Things [inaudible] going for me lately. Good. And school is a big part of my day-to-day. So with summer, school is often less hectic, and so more of my day-to-day's with research and clinical work. I mean, those are things I enjoy doing. And how's my life been going? Going well. What else? With summer, the weather is always nicer which I enjoy. I'm not a fan of winter here, coming from Texas, so we try to make as much time for enjoying the weather here when it's nice. I think that's about it. Hope [inaudible]. It's been going good, I guess, for the most part."
85.0,94.0,Subject,"So could you just tell me a little bit more about your program, maybe what got you into it, and what you like about it, what your day-to-day looks like?"
94.0,203.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. For sure. The program is a health program in psychology. It is a clinical program, so it gives us training in both clinic work and research. The clinic work is exciting. We get to do rotations both in the city or in the Tri-State area. And the training sites I've been at have been very pleasant, so that's been very enjoyable. The research as well is exciting. We work with older adults who have kind of chronic illness diagnoses and just kind of track them over time. They're often very pleasant to work with as well. That's been enjoyable. What led me to the program? New York or Yeshiva University wasn't at the top of our list, mainly because of how far it was from Texas, from my wife's family, and then just the change of pace. We were in a very small kind of town. The other schools we applied to were more kind of fit the location better for us. But yeah. Kind of Yeshiva's the only one that came back with the seats, so we were still very grateful for it, and so we accepted the offer. Been here since. And the program is also a plus in that it has the kind of health psychology emphasis and the settings I'm hoping to get training in and then hopefully work in, so it was a win there with sort of the minor emphasis they had for health psychology."
203.0,211.0,Subject,"Cool. And in terms of the change of pace, what has that been like for you to make that switch?"
211.0,402.0,Interviewer,"The change of pace, it's gotten better over time, I think. I grew up in a big city. I guess, nothing compares to the New York City belt, but I kind of naively thought it wouldn't be that big of a change even though people told us there would be change. Yeah. The biggest thing I think is just the pace. Things are very quick compared to Asia where I was born and raised, and then Texas where I spent the last six, seven years with school. People are very friendly here, but I think there's increased level of friendliness with kind of the southern states. They're just very pleasant. And just the kind of style of interacting that was different. And weather was huge as well. That change of sort of activities based on the year was very foreign to me, that you couldn't do something when it was the winter months. And yeah, finding activities that made sense to do, weather permitting. Housing was the biggest thing I think, yeah. The kind of just we were paying 800, I think, for a huge one-bed apartment in Texas in the small town area, and then here it was double that for half the size, I feel, of the studio we had. So that was huge. Kind of things that we took for granted and thought we could adapt very quickly, but. And my wife did. She was much more flexible in that way. I think I was still in shock at some of the big changes we had to make. Those were some of the biggest things. The public transportation wasn't bad, strangely enough. I think I enjoyed the commute. When we first came, we moved to the Bronx, and so that was a shorter commute. And it wasn't terrible. Kind of just getting used to the fact that things were outside of your control. It wasn't just jumping in the car and getting to campus. It was catching a subway and the little bus and then the walk. So those were the big pace changes, I think, or the big culture shocks that we had. And then after a couple months or after the first year, just about, my wife's coworkers who said they were from Jersey commuting into the city, and so then that kind of opened up the possibility that we could kind of commute in and give us that bit of a breather from the city. And New Jersey felt a lot more-- just the change of pace. Even just a couple miles aways, we could feel the difference. And so yeah. [inaudible] Jersey was much more agreeable for our kind of pace in New York."
402.0,411.0,Subject,Could you say a little bit more about the interaction differences that people would have here versus in the South?
411.0,508.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And maybe it's just a population thing, just the size of people. And we were in such a small town. It was 80,000 people [inaudible] Texas, so it's very ranching community, very rural in that sense, compared to something as urban as this. But there was just the chance you knew people just if you were there long enough. And yeah. So I think here, I was more hesitant to interact with people because I would think I was hesitant to be interacting with [bi?] people because it was just such a-- I just felt out of sorts, I guess. It wasn't comfortable to be in such a big city with so many people, so I think I was-- it's probably a two-way street. I think I was more hesitant to look people in the eye or greet them if I was kind of walking beside them or bumped into them. It was very much self-preservation like, ""Oh, maybe I should just keep to myself. I don't want to interrupt anyone or offend anyone."" Whereas in Texas, I think it was much more-- again, probably just the tiny town we were in. I was less concerned, I think, about a couple of those things. And just here, I guess, on [TV avenues?] that the east coast is more quick with you. They're more rough with you. They won't kind of be as patient with you in some other places. So I think it was a lot of bad stigma, I guess. And I came in thinking, ""Oh, I got to be-- I shouldn't be too friendly here."" Things could go bad. "
508.0,530.0,Subject,"It's like, yeah. So with the move to New Jersey being a bit more in line with your guys' previous style, do you feel that that has impacted the way that you see potentially staying here in the future, or do you feel like this is not going to be the place for you guys? How do you see this going forward?"
530.0,729.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It was very much a transition or I guess a pit stop on our kind of 5-year plan, 10-year plan. Not that we ever had big plans like that, but very temporary in that sense. Was just to come here, get the degree, get the clinical training, and then move back, I think. In a sense, it was either to Hannah's, my wife's family back in Texas or my family back in Southeast Asia. That was very much the plan, but. And then when coming to New York, it seemed that much more solidified, that plan. Was like, ""Oh, yeah. This really doesn't gel with us. We kind of got to go-- kind of go quick."" But New Jersey's made it much more relaxing. I think it was just the-- also during the pandemic, we ended up getting a car, so it felt very much more like Texas where you just needed to drive and go somewhere, we could. So yeah, it's made it much more agreeable with us. The program was supposed to be four years, but just at the speed I'm going for my dissertation, it's probably going to end up taking an extra year, a fifth year. So at first, that was a really big, I guess, regret that if I'd kind of worked quicker or put in more effort, maybe I could have finished it in four. And if we were still having to pay New York prices or stay in New York, I think we'd really felt that one year as [inaudible], but now it seems quite doable. It's like, yeah, another year. And it pushes things back a little bit, but it doesn't seem dire, I think, as when I first thought it would be. And New Jersey is just very-- even just the cheaper rent. The small things, I guess, added up. Whereas it definitely makes it more doable to stay the long run. And my wife is with a school district. She's worked almost exclusively as a speech therapist in schools. And Texas is notoriously one of the poorest school districts in the country and in terms of ranking. It's just very poor school districts. And then New York's kind of in the middle, but New Jersey is-- I think for a couple years, it's been one of the first in the country for how well they look after their students. Yeah, so. And she just got a position here in a school district, so really excited now to see how different schools are run. And she works with early childhood intervention, so all the research that they do shows it's so crucial to get kind of the right services at that age. And so she's really excited to be a part of a state that'll kind of respect the profession, give them the funding they need and the resources they need to do the best they can. So yeah. New Jersey definitely feels much more-- if it ends up being a long-term plan, if we end up having to stay for internship or postdoc in Jersey, it wouldn't be bad, I think. It would be very doable [crosstalk]."
729.0,749.0,Subject,"That's [inaudible]. That's good to hear. So socially, have there been also any factors that may contribute to the decision to stay versus leave? Have you felt that you've kind of found root socially here or not quite as much as back home?"
749.0,871.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It's a good question. I think it's not very much. I think most of our friends have been through work or school, essentially. And I guess because of COVID in a sense also-- and I guess how small things are here, especially our apartment in Texas, we used to host our friends or a church group, things like that, so it was more community in that way. I mean, because it was just less things also to do. I think when I was working back in Texas, it wasn't as busy as being in school, so yeah. Social roots are setting kind of-- being intentional with kind of making those connections has been harder. And with the pandemic, it's I guess even maybe more of an excuse probably to say, ""Oh, we don't need to make that commute to see--"" if there's a farewell party or something. It's more effortful, I think, to keep up social sort of appointments here. I think it's easier for me to just say, ""Well, we're busy,"" or, ""It's too long a commute,"" or something like that. So yeah. It's been harder here but not because, I think, that we haven't found the right groups. It's probably just I haven't been as intentional with kind of setting the time for it. And maybe, yeah, because we're married as well. Maybe it seems less relevant, but maybe if I were single, I probably would have made more effort, I think, to really get connected with my cohort or my class and have those social supports because it would be-- especially over a pandemic. It would have been very hard, I think, if I didn't have family nearby. So yeah. Little different and definitely not as-- we haven't put in as much effort as back home to keep up here."
871.0,891.0,Subject,"Yeah. So thinking about the pandemic a little bit, so you have family a little bit all over the world at this point. You said you have some family in Southeast Asia, in Texas. How has the pandemic maybe affected people differently? Or how have you seen that play out with all your different connections globally?"
891.0,1316.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Very different in all the places. When it first came to the United States, I guess, Asia was doing very well. And in Southeast Asia, particularly, was doing so well that we wished we were back home in the sense that they had-- it's just Southeast Asians in general are very respectful of authority. The idea that if a government told you to be in lockdown, they listened. We would have listened. So that really prevented it from being a wave when it first came. And then we were here. At that point, we still hadn't had a vehicle yet, so we really did feel isolated in the apartment complex we were in. So we just did kind of basic groceries, shopping, and then we were indoors. And New York being the epicenter initially, our family in Texas didn't really-- they were equal parts worried and equal parts, I think, just hesitant that it was-- maybe hesitant's not the right word. Questioning, I think, how big a deal it was. And there was so much misinformation, I think, at that point, or a lack of understanding that they felt it was. They were happy we're taking precautions [but?] they were, yeah, just questioning of how big a deal it was, I think, as well. I think at one point they were thinking, ""Well, maybe you could just--"" they were looking at flights and it was so cheap, I think. And so they said, ""Well, maybe we'd come for a holiday."" And it was in the middle of June last year, so right at one of the worst parts of it. And so that you could tell, it wasn't a huge priority for them, the pandemic, and so yeah. They were on two different wavelengths. Her family in Texas was very hesitant at first until I came there. And even then, it was a sort of a indifference of attitude of how seriously each family-- my wife has a big family; five siblings including [inaudible]. So they all have their own children. They all have their own spouses. And each family unit ending up having to kind of make their own decision of how seriously to take the pandemic. So it was very tough to sit on the sidelines and see sort of [some of the?] family members doing things that we wouldn't feel comfortable doing. And it's very hard to talk [back?] to family that way or to kind of make your opinion heard with family. She's the youngest. My wife is the youngest, so she didn't feel comfortable at times kind of speaking up and trying to convince them of maybe safer options. Christmas was difficult, 2020 Christmas, because things were kind of winding down. We were both in-- I was in a hospital placement, and my wife is in school districts here, so we got the vaccine very quickly, thankfully. But in Texas, they hadn't, but they were going to do a Christmas, I guess, dinner reunion. And my wife has a elderly grandparent who's got all the comorbidities to watch out for. And so it was very difficult to sit by and say, ""We don't agree with this. We don't want this to happen. Please can we delay this? Just for even six months. Can we do Christmas in July 2021?"" So everyone would be vaccinated and safe, and the chances of us passing this would be so much less. But they ended up doing it-- or parts of the family ended up doing it because it was kind of fragmenting the family, I guess, kind of figuring out who does what or who feels comfortable doing what. So it was a very good exercise in mindfulness because you couldn't really change anybody's opinion, and there was so little we could do from here. So yeah. The pandemic, especially the first year in the-- relationship between Texas and us became very strained at times just because we were just on different wavelengths. And thankfully, there was no vaccine hesitancy. There was just little, I guess, lack of precautions prior to the vaccine. But they all are vaccinated now. And with my family in Asia, in Malaysia, it's been much better. There, up until very recently, where they're essentially now where New York was, I think, a year ago, essentially. It's just taken longer to get there because they couldn't kind of keep up the precautions long enough, essentially, and people got tired. And a huge percentage of Malaysian workers are day wage earners, meaning that if they don't work that day, they don't get food, essentially. They don't have enough for basic necessities. And so tourism is huge. And when you lockdown a country that long, they don't earn. Yeah, just that whole kind of financial spiraling that's happened to so many Malaysians has been tough to see. And they don't have the resources to purchase kind of a huge vaccine load like some of the richer countries do. So it's been tough just seeing families struggle to get kind of access to a vaccine that here so many have but a good chunk of them, people don't want to take. So the sort of incongruence there between a life-saving treatment or a preventative treatment and people's perception of it has been hard. Thankfully, my family has been safe through the pandemic. And yeah. I would say that's been probably the biggest way the pandemic's affected our families is it's kind of hit them in different waves. Us first, then our family in Texas, now our family in Asia. And hopefully, I guess, this would be the [last stop?]. It should be kind of fading, so we'll see. But yeah, that's kind of how it's affected our families."
1316.0,1354.0,Subject,"Yeah. That sounds so tough with the kind of two polar opposites almost in terms of the initial response. And then as you said, the incongruence between the national capabilities is, yeah, wow. So what was that like for maybe specifically your wife at that point, kind of early on, navigating those conversations? I know a lot of people have had a lot of just strife within families and within friend groups as a result of kind of these varying opinions. Is that her experience? How was that like for her?"
1354.0,1608.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Very similar. She's a very loving family. In a good way– in some bad ways, they're very close. They're kind of almost enmeshed. And I don't say that in a bad way, but the idea that they kind of really rely on each other. For a long time, it was just the five siblings and her mom, so it's very hard for one person to stick out, if that makes sense. They naturally kind of go in the same direction, make the same decisions. Moving to New York was very difficult for the family because it was the first sibling to move out of state. Yeah. So my wife found it hard. Things that maybe I would have felt comfortable speaking to about with my family, she didn't. So it was a lot of tiptoeing around decisions, I guess. And we kind of discussed ways that she could kind of throw decisions on me in the sense that if her family were upset that she didn't want to come back for Christmas, she'll say, ""Well, Deevan's in the hospital. He may have COVID. We don't want to bring anything back."" So the idea that she had a way out without hurting her family by saying, ""I don't feel comfortable,"" and saying, ""Oh, he's not going to get time off,"" or something like that. So yeah. It's a lot of deflection, a lot of how do we have those conversations. I think for the most part, we just didn't. We knew that if we had these conversations head on, it wouldn't have been kind of well received. So it was just encouraging everybody to make their own decisions and really trying to protect the most vulnerable which we felt were her mom and grandmother because they had the most health comorbidities, the most to lose in that sense. And yeah, so kind of prioritizing their health through the process. A lot of it-- a lot of the conversations were just kind of information sharing, almost because the sources of news they would get was oftentimes from the church. That was a very small, insular church that didn't have their own interpretation. A lot of things that weren't really accurate. So kind of just a lot of [psycho?] education, essentially, for the family, just, ""This is what we're hearing here. Is that the same thing you're hearing?"" Lot of encouragement to just make their own decisions while trying to explain to them what was at stake, one Christmas for a funeral because I think at that point, we were so afraid that that's what would have happened. So the conversations were tough. Yeah. I often had to put on headphones. Because we live in a small studio up here as well, but I didn't want to be a part of those conversations a lot of times because it was quite tough to hear her having to interact with her family that way. So yeah. I think for a lot, I think I just was very disengaged unless I was called on. And it wasn't that I wasn't saying hi to them or anything. I would kind of check in, see how they're doing. But as soon as it kind of switched to the news with vaccine or travel or Christmas, any sort of buzzwords that I knew I wouldn't agree with what would be said or it would just be really hard for me to keep composure and be in those conversations, I would kind of just put headphones on and do emails or reading or something because it would have been very hard, I think, to keep up appearances even over Skype or even over FaceTime. Yeah, tough conversation."
1608.0,1637.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm interested to hear a bit more if you would share perhaps about how religion played a role throughout the pandemic, maybe positively, negatively? Just faith and yeah, how religion was impacting. You mentioned in a sense of the news sources, maybe also in other ways. What was your guys' relationship with faith and religion at that point, and how did it play into the pandemic?"
1637.0,2058.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It definitely was there. I was raised Methodist. And so for, yeah, pretty much my whole life, I was in a church and very involved growing up. The school we went to in Texas was a small private school, so religion was very much sort of everything. Infiltrated, I guess. It's not the right word. A part of everything we did for most of my childhood. And more recently, with the move here, in particular to New York, it was tough to-- religion just kind of took on a different role for me. And it's not that I wasn't questioning before, it was harder, I guess, to follow the theology, I think, that I was raised with. And I was struggling more with, I guess, core aspects of it. And maybe it was just school, the stress, the big change, so it was probably not the best time to start deconstructing my faith, but it just happened. I guess I couldn't really stop it. So it was leading up to the pandemic. It was a challenge already for me, I think, to sit still like a Methodist church and not sometimes swear or get upset at something a [teacher?] or pastor said. I think we were also raised very conservatively, and the idea that we could-- churches here in a big city like this have so much more progressive ideas, and that was very exciting that we could worship in a church where we agreed with more of their public policies, I guess, or public stances. And we did. We kind of visited an Episcopal church nearby when we were still in the Bronx. It was very pleasant, progressive. But yeah, sort of just going in, it was sort of that not as frame of a faith, I guess. It was more fluid going into the pandemic. And then seeing the pandemic like this on this scale was very tricky to navigate. I had a very hard time, at least with the faith I was raised in. The idea that there's a kind of a benevolent good creator God was very hard to reconcile. And all of the kind of traditional Sunday School answers just didn't feel like were working anymore, I guess. The idea that all things work together for good and that there is a divine plan was very tough. And my parents, my mom, especially, is still very much of that faith. And so when she would say those verses or say any of those things, it didn't bring any comfort. It was opposite, kind of like irritation almost. It seemed rude to mention those things when so many people were suffering. And then yeah. And then kind of the politics of faith, how it was played out in Texas was just very upsetting. It left us with-- it really cemented my views on a lot of things like the churches we were in during our college just weren't good in that sense. They were very one-sided in their interpretation of events. The idea that this was a tool. The pandemic was like a fearmongering thing.  And if you were a Christian, you didn't need to be afraid. So very loose interpretations that we didn't at all agree with. But Hannah's family were in that system still and very much believers in that system, so it's hard to argue with-- or hard to have a debate with someone whose answer is, ""My pastor said so. The Bible is telling me this. I prayed this, and this is what was told to me."" So yeah. Faith's changed a lot during the pandemic. And probably it wasn't the thing that started it, at least for me, my deconstruction, I don't think. But it sped up the process, I think, because it forced me to look at a lot of things that I was less, I guess, happy to keep aside for the time being, and not have to connect and do a deep dive into the theology of it. But it sped things up, forced me to look at it. And I'm grateful for the experience. I don't know if I would call myself a Methodist anymore or a Christian anymore. It's very hard, I guess, for me to describe my faith now. So I've done a lot of reading, I guess. I've tried to find new things, and it's funny in the sense. I think I felt so-- [I think?] the word disempowered during the pandemic that I couldn't really help with anybody. And we're in a mental health profession, but the idea that I couldn't really be on the ground helping somebody or didn't have even spare funds to donate to somebody or to give to somebody or do a food bank, things like that, that I picked up or I stopped eating meat. I guess the idea that I was savings-- wasn't hurting any other life, I guess, so I became vegetarian over the pandemic, I guess. And that's weirdly been very comforting, I guess, the idea that I was helping in my own way. It's a very tiny way. But yeah, that was a nice-- and it's somewhat religious to me, I guess. It's not a vow or anything in that way, but it's taken on a sort of spiritual component, I guess, because I find it a small way of giving back, I guess, because we've been very fortunate through all of this that my wife has been able to work through it. Even [through?] the first wave when none of us were working, she was still getting a pay check. So yeah, just a way of us to-- a way for me to show how grateful I am, I guess, was to try and do the least amount of harm to the environment. And kind of becoming vegetarian or as close to it as I can be with my-- it seemed like a good choice, I guess."
2058.0,2075.0,Subject,"Yeah, absolutely. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Thank you so much for sharing all this with me. I really just appreciate it so much. I found your whole story so fascinating, and I just really appreciate the kind of earnestness with which you were really responding to these questions, so thank you so, so much."
