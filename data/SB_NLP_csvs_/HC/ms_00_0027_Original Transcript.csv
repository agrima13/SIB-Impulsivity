2.0,6.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,14.0,Subject,"Pretty well. I recently got accepted to graduate school, so I've been kind of on that high. "
14.0,18.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh. That's so exciting. Congratulations.
18.0,20.0,Subject,Thank you. 
20.0,23.0,Interviewer,"Wow, that's huge. For what? What type of program?"
23.0,25.0,Subject,Clinical psychology PhD.
25.0,28.75,Interviewer,Oh my gosh. That's amazing.
28.75,29.0,Subject,Thank you.
29.0,33.0,Interviewer,"I really know how hard those are to get into, so that's awesome. Congratulations. "
33.0,35.0,Subject,Yeah. Thank you so much. 
35.0,42.0,Interviewer,"That's so exciting. Okay. So, wow. When did you find out about that?"
42.0,51.0,Subject,"I found out last week, on Monday. So it's still kind of like riding the high from getting that news. "
51.0,62.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, definitely. So what was your process like? How did you know that you wanted to do that, and what made you apply this round? And how was your whole process?"
62.0,129.0,Subject,"So I actually went into college knowing that I wanted to major in psychology. I was always debating between working in psychology and working in medicine, and I went for medicine first. So I became an EMT and interned at American Red Cross, but through those experiences, I found out that I didn't really like the settings. It was too much pressure on me, so I began doing research in different labs at my undergraduate institution and kind of found the PhD route and discovering what the psychology degree is, the doctorate. So I really liked what that entailed, and I liked all my psychology classes a lot more than my premed classes. And so I kind of slowly made that transition. And I applied to graduate schools last cycle because I graduated in 2020, and that, unfortunately, wasn't successful due to lack of funding and stuff like that. So I reapplied this cycle, and I got in, thank God. "
129.0,135.0,Interviewer,"That's so great. I mean, yeah, I think also right out of undergrad, it's so hard to get in. "
135.0,136.0,Subject,"Yeah, it is really hard."
136.0,152.0,Interviewer,"I feel like you were probably in the doubly whammy situation of COVID, lack of funding weird situation, plus I feel like they always prioritize people who have had at least a year of research experience after graduating. "
152.0,153.75,Subject,I find--
153.75,154.0,Interviewer,But--
154.0,167.0,Subject,"Oh, yeah. I did have a lot of research experience under my belt, and I was put on the waiting list for one of my top choices. But they said they were only accepting two slots that year due to COVID, and--"
167.0,169.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so few."
169.0,175.0,Subject,Yeah. So that happened last year. But it's okay. We can forget about that school.
175.0,185.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. [laughter] So did you apply to a bunch of schools, or was it really just this one school that you wanted to go to? Or how did it work for you?"
185.0,203.0,Subject,"I applied to about eight different schools. This program was up there. It was one of my top choices. The only reason why I prioritized a different school is because the other school was funded and this one isn't, but it's okay. At least I got an acceptance, so it's a great program. "
203.0,226.0,Interviewer,"That's it. That's amazing. And sometimes the non-fully-funded programs have other focuses that are also kind of more interesting. I don't know. I've heard about ones that have more clinical focus and have more clinical hours, and I don't know, sometimes when they're not fully-funded, it means it's not only research in that way."
226.0,241.0,Subject,"Yeah. They actually have the ability to concentrate in different areas and give you a specialization. So I really like that program for that reason because I'm interested in neuropsychology, so they have that concentration."
241.0,247.0,Interviewer,And what does neuropsychology involve or look like down the road?
247.0,271.0,Subject,"It's a lot of cognitive assessments. It's dealing with patients that might have had either brain injuries or different neuropsychological disorders. And I really wanted to focus on that and see, maybe, how other psychological illnesses associate with neurological illnesses, so I really like that specialization."
271.0,286.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's cool. So basically, you're saying how, for example, let's say some degeneration of the brain itself would impact you then having symptoms in more of a psychiatric realm?"
286.0,287.0,Subject,Yeah. 
287.0,296.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so interesting. Wow. Oh my gosh. This is huge. I mean, I feel like we shouldn't even talk about anything else, but at the same time, maybe we should [crosstalk]."
296.0,299.0,Subject,Yeah. No problem. 
299.0,309.0,Interviewer,Okay. We'll come back to this. It's just too exciting. But other things that are going on. How is family? How are friends?
309.0,338.0,Subject,"Pretty good. Family's pretty tight knit. So I still live at home, so I still am with my family a lot. Friends, since adulting, is nothing right now. A lot of people are just doing their own thing, like one got married and one of them just finished nursing school, so we've had conflicting schedules. We haven't really met up recently or anything like that. But otherwise, it's pretty good. "
338.0,340.75,Interviewer,"[crosstalk]. No, sorry. Go ahead. "
340.75,341.0,Subject,I'm sorry?
341.0,342.0,Interviewer,"No, go ahead."
342.0,357.0,Subject,"Oh. If you ask me this, these questions before I got the acceptance or anything like that, I would be in a completely different place because that process is just gruesome."
357.0,366.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It really impedes every other area of your life, doesn't it? It's just right here on your head all the time. "
366.0,370.0,Subject,"Yeah, and for two years. It's crazy."
370.0,373.0,Interviewer,It must be such a huge weight off your shoulders. 
373.0,378.0,Subject,Yeah. I haven't felt this free since like [all of?] COVID. The whole entire--
378.0,380.0,Interviewer,I [crosstalk].
380.0,385.0,Subject,"--time we had COVID, I was just thinking about this application process and taking the GRE and all that stuff."
385.0,387.0,Interviewer,Don't remind me. [laughter] 
387.0,390.0,Subject,Oh my gosh. 
390.0,402.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's amazing. So what is it like for you to live at home? Is that an experience that you are enjoying? What are some good things about it, not so good things about it? "
402.0,438.0,Subject,"Yeah, I really enjoy living at home. I feel like my family is my biggest support system, along with my partner, and so I always feel supported. And I feel like I have people to go to and people to laugh with and communicate with and hang out with, so I really do value that a lot. I don't see, really, any negatives with living at home, besides for the occasional family bickerments. But the one thing I don't look forward to is-- well, I kind of do look forward to it but don't look forward to it is moving out, just because I am really close with my family. "
438.0,445.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So what will be the pros and cons of moving out, whenever that step happens for you?"
445.0,489.0,Subject,"Kind of like losing my best friends because I won't be seeing them every day and speaking to them as often because life gets busy. And if you're not physically seeing somebody, you don't really communicate as well. I mean, as my past communication skills. So that's one thing, just missing them and not being able to see them as often. But pros is kind of like developing a life with my partner if I move out with them, and then kind of taking a step forward in my future. And even though I am independent now, it's gaining even more independence and just living life on my own terms and decorating my own apartment and stuff like that, so that's exciting too."
489.0,500.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Well, that's going to be so exciting. Is it possible that you could move in a similar area? Or do you feel like that wouldn’t be what you would do?"
500.0,524.0,Subject,"So I would stay in New York City, so it would be maybe maximum an hour, an hour and a half with traffic away from them. But it's different not coming home to them and stuff like that because [inaudible] live together. But I do worry if they move to a different state because my sister is looking to go to college in a different state, and my parents want to move there also. So--"
524.0,525.0,Interviewer,Uh-oh. 
525.0,532.0,Subject,"--that's like an unpleasant thought. But I'll worry about it when it gets there, I guess."
532.0,536.0,Interviewer,Is there anything appealing to the other state for you? Would you ever consider going there?
536.0,547.0,Subject,"I would. But now that I just got into graduate school and it's about six years, I don't see myself moving anytime soon. Yeah. Especially with how hard it was to get in the first place. I'm not doing that cycle again. [laughter] "
547.0,555.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I feel like they should stay with you because yours is six years. Hers is three years. 
555.0,563.0,Subject,"Yeah, exactly. But they are sick of New York and they want better weather and stuff, so I don't want to take that away from them and make them stay. "
563.0,572.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so hard. So what would your-- so would your partner be interested in that other state as well? Or is he/she having--"
572.0,573.0,Subject,He--
573.0,575.0,Interviewer,--a job in New York or?
575.0,591.0,Subject,"So he's currently in nursing school, but he knows how important it is for me to stay close to my family, and he knows how important the sun is to me. So I think he would be willing to try it if it works out with a job and stuff like that [crosstalk]."
591.0,597.0,Interviewer,"That's [great?]. Oh, that's so great. And how long have you guys been together?"
597.0,605.0,Subject,A year and - let me do the math - I would say seven months. It would be two years in June.
605.0,606.75,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. That's a while."
606.75,607.0,Subject,Yeah. So--
607.0,609.0,Interviewer,And it's been going well so far?
609.0,610.0,Subject,"Yeah, really well. "
610.0,624.75,Interviewer,"That's really great. What are some things that-- and also, I should have said this at the front, but at any time if I'm saying something or asking you something and you don't want to answer it or it's not a topic that you want to talk about, we'll just switch topics. Okay? "
624.75,625.0,Subject,Okay. No problem.
625.0,644.0,Interviewer,"Just let me know. But I was just going to ask you, if you had any previous relationships, what are some things - or even if you haven't - that you've brought into this relationship that you wanted to kind of foster and define in this new partnership that you guys are building? "
644.0,725.0,Subject,"So I have had previous relationships, one that was serious enough to call a relationship. It didn't last as long as this one, but I did learn a lot of what I want in a partner and what I look for in a relationship. Yeah. So I knew kind of like the standard of a person that I would want and the respect that I would want and kind of like the dynamic, the best-friend dynamic, but also the partner dynamic. So I learned that I love that from my previous relationship, but a lot of things that I didn't get to develop in my last relationship but I did in this one is building communication and learning my communication style and how to navigate uncomfortable situations with somebody that you need to learn to trust. And so that was a learning experience because I didn't date the last person long enough to really foster that much of communication skills and really navigate anything past the honeymoon phase. But this one, you do have to realize how you are as a person but also how to grow and learn to accommodate the other person's love languages and communication styles as well and how to meet in the middle and compromise on a lot of things."
725.0,744.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I feel like the love language is just something that people talk about a lot, but maybe not as much communication styles. You know what I mean? People just say, ""Oh, communication is important,"" but they're not like, ""I have this way of communicating."" I think that's such an interesting thought. So what are some of the different styles that you feel like you've identified as you've--"
744.0,745.0,Subject,[inaudible]. 
745.0,748.0,Interviewer,"--kind of been figuring out your own? Yeah, your communication styles."
748.0,791.0,Subject,"So he likes to talk about-- let's say we were in an argument, for example. He likes to talk about things right away and solve the problem right away. But I feel like I'm a lot more emotional and I can get explosive if I'm really heated in the moment, so I tend to close up and take a step back and only revisit it in like a few days. But what I did learn was, because he likes to solve it immediately and I like to take a step back because I don't want to say anything I don't mean, we kind of compromise by meeting in the middle. Like we agreed that we will solve it by the end of the day, but it doesn't have to be at that moment, so I can take that time for myself and he can also have the issue solved before the next day. "
791.0,797.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so cool. That's a lovely solution. [laughter] That's so good. "
797.0,800.0,Subject,"Yeah. It took some work to get there, but."
800.0,825.0,Interviewer,"Sure, yeah. But that's great. Oh, so interesting to think about communication styles. I mean, I feel like, yeah, I don't even know my communication style. I think I would be very direct. I think that's more my-- maybe I would be the one to want to solve it right away. But at the same time, maybe it's better not to, a little bit. Maybe the delay is actually good, even though it's my urge to want to solve it right away."
825.0,849.0,Subject,"Yeah, because the delay really let's you think about how you want to deliver something because it could be right on top of your mind, but because it's so new and fresh and it is a little bit emotional because it is an argument, things can come offer the wrong way or in the way that the other person doesn't receive so well. So thinking about delivery is also a really big one, also."
849.0,861.75,Interviewer,"Yeah. And also, sometimes, maybe if you take that extra time, you're better at pinpointing the specific thing that is really bothering you."
861.75,862.0,Subject,"Yeah, definitely."
862.0,883.0,Interviewer,"Like sometimes when something is becoming an argument, a lot more things start bothering you or you just start saying that certain things are the issue when maybe that wasn't the true, specific issue. I don’t know. Maybe, yeah, that extra time also helps you think about what the specific issue would be or [inaudible] want to prioritize arguing about."
883.0,934.0,Subject,"Yeah. That's actually happened to me. If there's an underlying issue but it's been held inside and it hasn't been resolved or brought up, then other fights start happening. Maybe they're smaller. Maybe they're over insignificant things that don't really matter. The fight is originally because of the insignificant things, but the long you wait, you're able to unravel the true underlying issue. So I did realize that waiting-- and if talk about it right away, it might not be the true reason why I'm upset. But he's really receptive in that, and he understands sometimes that, ""Okay, this is really idiotic, and I know she wouldn't bring this up or be upset about this. There's definitely something else,"" so he'll give me that time to really [crosstalk]."
934.0,958.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so nice. That's so nice. Yeah. So what are some things that you feel like you guys might encounter for the first time, when you guys are living together, that maybe you haven't had to encounter yet? It could be good things or bad things, but I guess I was more thinking challenges that you guys would work through. "
958.0,1016.0,Subject,"Challenges? It might be different lifestyles and routines. So I only know so much of his-- I mean, we've been on trips together that's been about a week, so I only know a certain portion of how he is and mornings when we wake up and what his routine is like. But I feel like just living together constantly and figuring out how to fluidly maneuver conversations and let go of the little things because, now you're living with the person, it's not like you can take a step back and you're away from the person if you are upset, or. So there's that, and then there's also maybe differences in organization and lifestyle preferences. I'm not sure 100% because, from what it seems right now, we're really compatible, but I do think that there might be something new that we’d have to learn to navigate when we live together. "
1016.0,1058.75,Interviewer,"Yeah, totally. I think the city, actually, is somewhat more conducive to leaving and getting your own space than being in a suburb, though. At least, that's my impression. I totally agree that being around someone all the time is different than just seeing them when you plan to see each other, [but?] I think living in the city, because there's so much independence because you don't need a car to go everywhere or it's not weird to just go outside and go for a walk-- you could feasibly leave the apartment and go for a walk and have it be a bit more normal than if you were just in the middle of a rural suburb just going for a walk by the cornfields. You know what I mean? [laughter] "
1058.75,1059.0,Subject,Yeah. 
1059.0,1074.0,Interviewer,"So I think that that's one benefit of doing your first move together in a city like New York because if it ever did come to a time where you were like, ""Okay. I want some alone time,"" go to a CVS, go to a grocery store. "
1074.0,1075.0,Subject,Yeah. Anywhere. 
1075.0,1082.75,Interviewer,"You can literally do anything, and so I think that that makes it feel a little bit less dramatic when you leave. Do you know what I mean?"
1082.75,1083.0,Subject,Yeah. 
1083.0,1115.0,Interviewer,"There's not this isolated, meandering vision that the person would have of you. You're just dropping by some store. But I definitely think the organization thing is really interesting. I think people don't think about it as something that's going to matter to them when they meet someone. You're not like, ""Hi, how are you? What's your organization style?"" But it does come up maybe down the road, so it's really interesting. "
1115.0,1118.0,Subject,"Yeah, it is, especially if they're very different. "
1118.0,1129.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Do you feel like you're somebody who really values routines in the morning, in the evening? Or is it more like are you-- do you feel like you're more spontaneous in that way? "
1129.0,1172.0,Subject,"So I can navigate both, but I do realize that I do better with routine. And I feel like I'm a lot more productive when I have my days planned out, or not even planned out, but just having tasks that I want to accomplish in that day. I do like doing those things and feeling more organized. I feel like I have more, I guess, control over my day and knowing that I'll be able to get things done. But I do have days where I have nothing planned and just see how it goes, but I am more productive when I have things on my to-do list that I know I'm going to be doing and tackling for the next days.  "
1172.0,1206.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, me too. Yeah. I feel like for me, too, there's such a disjoint between what I want myself to do innately and then what I actually do innately. So it's just a struggle of like, ""Is my inner self going to win or my brain?"" I want to be a morning person, for example, and I want to go to sleep at like 10:30 and I want to wake up at 7:00. That's my dream life, and I wish my body would wake up at 7:00. [laughter] That is just truly not the case. "
1206.0,1247.0,Subject,"Well, funny, because I used to be a night owl in high school. I used to do-- I mean, I used to be up really early anyways because I'd have to commute, but I would sleep at 1:00, 2:00, 3:00 AM and maybe get like two to three hours sleep a night, which is so unhealthy because I would do so much work after classes and have extracurriculars. And I used to be a night owl. I used to be able to do work through the night and be fine at running on such little sleep. But then college came around, and I really prioritized sleep, and I became a morning person. And now that I'm two years out of college and I have a job that requires me to wake up at 6:30 and stuff, I can't make it like past [11:30?]. "
1247.0,1249.0,Interviewer,"Oh, you're fully converted?"
1249.0,1266.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm just converted. I wake up. I'm more productive in the mornings. My brain feels like it works better in the mornings. I have more clarity. And then every time I try to put on a movie at night, I just knock out. I don't even watch movies at night because I'm so tired. "
1266.0,1273.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's the dream. The dream. All right. So what is your current job? I didn't even ask you. "
1273.0,1277.0,Subject,I currently work as a research assistant in Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
1277.0,1281.0,Interviewer,"Oh, wow. Fun. Okay. So more research?"
1281.0,1282.0,Subject,"Yeah, research."
1282.0,1289.0,Interviewer,"And what is your lab's research goal, project?"
1289.0,1315.0,Subject,So we are looking at visual somatic sensory integration as a novel marker for preclinical Alzheimer's disease. So [inaudible] if changes in visual somatic sensory integration can predict or be used as a marker to diagnose Alzheimer's in the really early stages before it really gets to dementia or really bad cognitive impairment or memory impairment. 
1315.0,1327.0,Interviewer,"Wow. So when you say visual somatic sensory integration, is that like integrating senses of feeling and what you're seeing? Am I getting that right? Or is more nuanced than that?"
1327.0,1355.0,Subject,Yeah. So we'd have visual stimuli. We're going to be testing visual stimuli. We are testing motor tasks and also sense of smell and other cognitive areas as well and just how individuals integrate all different types of sensory information and cognitive information. And we'd be testing healthy individuals - elderly individuals - and then individuals with cognitive impairment as well.
1355.0,1365.0,Interviewer,"Wait, what is your minimum age cut off, by the way? Because I just have some healthy controls who are over our age limit if you want me to send them to you."
1365.0,1368.0,Subject,"Okay, yeah. I think our minimum is 65. "
1368.0,1390.0,Interviewer,"65. Okay. I think ours are in the 50s, but I can keep an eye out if anyone comes our way. I can always send them to you or ask. Okay. That's so interesting. Wait, so what is your measure for kind of successful integration of these modalities? How can you tell if someone is good at integrating versus not good?"
1390.0,1464.0,Subject,"So for the motor tasks, for example, we have different measures. We have the Berg Balance Scale, and that's scored based off of how well you can perform different stances and how strong your muscles are and if you can actually exert the pressure or balance a certain way, so that's for the motor task. And then for the cognitive tasks, we have a lot of neuropsych tests like the WAIS, the HBLT, and those are scored as well. So then you have normative scores, and then you can base where an individual is based off of those scores. And we have visual screens such as the Snellen chart that you have in the eye doctors and other visual tasks. Like contrast sensitivity, we're using as a measure, and that's more determining somebody's baseline. So it's not whether or not you have-- it's not whether or not you're doing well or you aren’t doing well. It's more of how well you can process contrast, so where you are on that scale. So it's those different things."
1464.0,1498.0,Interviewer,"And so, okay - sorry - I might have misunderstood initially, but I thought what your predictor variable was was how well these people are able to integrate all these different ones. Is it more just like are any of these individual motor or cognitive or visual tasks related to the onset of Alzheimer's, or is it more like are all of these together-- if there's a deficit in this battery of different tests, is that related to it?"
1498.0,1505.0,Subject,"So we have, actually, three different aims. So one aim is the first point that you said and one aim is actually the second because we want to know more--"
1505.0,1506.0,Interviewer,Oh. 
1506.0,1531.0,Subject,"Yeah. We want to know more about how these three different - the sensory, motor, and the cognitive - areas manifest in healthy and unhealthy individuals, especially with Alzheimer's, and then we want to see how that integration manifests in different individuals that are healthy and that aren’t healthy. So we're kind of looking at [inaudible] different things. "
1531.0,1549.0,Interviewer,"Okay. That's so cool. Okay. Sorry, I'm just thinking about this. So how did you get people who might be at risk for developing Alzheimer's? Is it people who have Alzheimer's already, or how did you identify that other group?"
1549.0,1589.0,Subject,"It's people who have mild cognitive impairment, so who have a slight loss in cognitive impairment. We would be referred to by their-- they would be referred to us by their doctors. And individuals who might have had an increase in fall risks lately or people who are prone to developing cognitive impairment or people who have been showing symptoms noted by their caretakers, they would be referred to us. But also, we would determine it based off of our tests as well."
1589.0,1593.0,Interviewer,Okay. And then do you follow them to see if they develop Alzheimer's? 
1593.0,1605.0,Subject,"Yeah. So it's a five-year-long study, so we follow them for five years, five to seven years. And I think there's about one to three visits per year. "
1605.0,1613.0,Interviewer,Wow. That's awesome. I hope you guys find really conclusive results. That would be really good. 
1613.0,1614.0,Subject,"Yeah, thank you. "
