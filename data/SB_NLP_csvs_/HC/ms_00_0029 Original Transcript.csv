1.0,5.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,26.0,Subject,"They're okay. I guess a little stressed, but that's because I'm applying to grad school soon, so that's what it is. I guess that also makes me a little anxious too. But I think after I submit my application, I'll be on track again."
26.0,37.0,Interviewer,"So are you stressed about kind of any other aspects of your life, or is this mainly kind of what's been taking up your brain space?"
37.0,54.0,Subject,"Like besides the grad school application? I guess, I mean, family. Family's always stressful, so every now and then, there'll be a family-related stressor, and yeah."
54.0,63.0,Interviewer,"So on the grad school theme, what about it do you feel like has been kind of causing the stress or anxiety?"
63.0,103.0,Subject,"It's really just one particular thing, and it's taking the GRE. So this will be my second time taking it. Taking it next week, actually. Exactly a week from now. So I have to get a certain score for them to at least, I guess-- I mean, I could get lower, but ideally, there's a score that they want. And the last time I took it, I was a couple of points off in both sections. So the goal is to just, hopefully, get a little closer-- do a little bit better than last time. But we'll see. Honestly, I think I'm just going to submit my application anyway, even if I don't do as well. Yeah. Yeah."
103.0,106.0,Interviewer,"And so first of all, good luck."
106.0,107.0,Subject,Thank you.
107.0,118.0,Interviewer,"And so when you think about grad school and why you want to go that way, could you just say a little bit about kind of what inspired that decision, or what led you to that decision?"
118.0,157.0,Subject,"So for me, I want to go to optometry school. And I guess it's something I kind of was set on by the time I started college, and I've been working towards that doing additional shadowing, volunteer experiences to make sure that I enjoy it. And I do, so I feel really confident with the route I'm going with. And I do think I have a strong application, which is why, I guess, part of me has been not so consistent with studying with the GRE even though I should be. And yeah, I think that's it."
157.0,167.0,Interviewer,"And in terms of before even you did those shadowing opportunities, what was it that maybe piqued your interest about optometry specifically?"
167.0,224.0,Subject,"So I guess-- oh my god. I mean, I come from a first-generation immigrant family, so for my parents, their biggest thing was just educating all the-- I have two other sisters, so educating all their daughters and making sure they at least finish college. So me being the youngest, I definitely had the upper hand in terms of the opportunities and resources that I got. I also got to see what my sisters went through, so I kind of learned from them. And I guess from a young age, I knew I wanted to be in the medical field. I mean, it was partly because of my parents, but also just because it's something that I did want to do. So [that being?] in the medical field, as I grew up, I just started exploring my options and seeing what was going to be best for me, and I ended up deciding to go with optometry."
224.0,233.0,Interviewer,And can you say a little more about what you mean in terms of being the youngest and having kind of looked to your sisters through their experiences?
233.0,277.0,Subject,"So my sisters and I have a pretty big age gap. My oldest is going to be 37 this year. So she and I have a 15-year gap-- 14- or 15-year gap. And then my middle is turning 31 this year, so she and I have a big gap too. And so in a way, they both sort of were hands-on in terms of me growing up. They were kind of like mom number two and number three. So I basically watched them grow into adults also. So I learned from any choices that they made whether that would be something I should do or whether it's something I shouldn't do. Things like that."
277.0,289.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And what did that mean for you to be the youngest and have more resources? Did that mean that emotional support, or were there other aspects of resources?"
289.0,342.0,Subject,"I think being the youngest, also put a different set of pressure on me because it's kind of like, ""Oh, that one's going to make it. That one's going to be the doctor."" So that's the pressure I get. But honestly, it's more of a pressure I put on myself because my family, they really do their best to make sure that's not the only thing I have to do. I can do what I want. But I guess in the back of my head, part of me just wants to make my family proud and make myself proud for having all these resources that my sisters didn't have. And not financially struggling with my-- I mean, with my parents, when they first came as immigrants, it was a big struggle, and my sisters grew up in that struggle. But I didn't. I didn't have that struggle. And they were also just-- they're also just very supportive with whatever I decide to do, so I appreciate that."
342.0,351.0,Interviewer,That's wonderful. Yeah. So how is your relationship with your sisters? What does that look like now?
351.0,433.0,Subject,"I'm really close with my middle sister. I see her at least twice a week. I actually babysit for her. She has a 8-month-old. So I help her babysit. But my relationship with my oldest sister isn't that great. She's actually home, so I'm not really-- I don't think she can hear me. But I would say it's just complicated in the sense that it's hard because she kind of had to give up her childhood to raise me and my other sister while my parents both worked because they were financially struggling. And so she didn't really get that experience to just live a young life. But now that she's a lot older, I feel like she's going through the phase where she wants to live that life, and it sort of-- for context, she's a single mom and she has an 8-year-old daughter, and they both live with us. So sometimes I feel like she kind of lost her maternal touch with her daughter. And it's because she wants to go out and she wants to do all the other things. But it ends up being that my mom ends up raising my niece instead of her. So I feel a negative way about that. And I've tried to talk to her about it, but it hasn't been very successful"
433.0,461.0,Interviewer,"No, that sounds extremely challenging. And maybe understandable, but also challenging. So is your older sister involved kind of in the sense of being around the house? Or is it more that you guys would kind of do other activities?"
461.0,466.0,Subject,"Oh, sorry about that. I think that was my email. Sorry, can you say that last bit again?"
466.0,475.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Just how do you and your middle sister maybe spend time together and kind of put effort into your relationship?
475.0,560.0,Subject,"I think with my middle sister, the biggest thing with us is that-- okay, so when my parents first came here, which was a long time ago like easily over 20 years ago, they had a really traditional mindset because they were coming from-- they were coming from-- I'm from Bangladesh. And so they really tried their best to stick to those traditional values, and I think imposing that on my two younger-- they were young at that time, had an effect on them because they were growing up in New York City and super modern. And I think with my older sister, she kind of got stuck in between it by sticking with the traditional side. But my middle sister was the more rebellious one. She was the one that wanted to do other things. She wanted to date people. My parents were super against dating. Things that I guess we find more normal, but to my parents, it wasn't at the time. So I think because my older sister was-- because she was older, she sided more with my parents and listened more to them, but my middle sister was like, ""I'm not listening to this. I'm going to do what I want so that it makes me happy."" So I think that rebellious side sort of paved the path for me to be able to choose what I want to do and my parents being more open to it and acceptable-- I mean, they're accepting me for what I want to do. And that's probably why I relate more to my middle sister."
560.0,582.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. So how has this kind of upbringing with your two sisters and your parents having immigrated impacted maybe-- we talked a little bit about how it impacted your future career directions, but what about your friendships and your other personal relationships?"
582.0,680.0,Subject,"So when I was younger, both my parents worked. And by younger, I mean maybe first, second grade. Financially, we were doing a lot better, but my parents both still worked full-time jobs. And both my older sisters were either in high school or college, so they were busy with school stuff. And like I mentioned, there's a huge age gap with me, so it was kind of just me around the age of 7, 8 years old. And I think I kind of grew up with a super independent mindset because I kind of just saw everyone doing their own thing. Don't get me wrong, while my family was around, I also didn't want to bother them sometimes because I saw how busy they were. So I ended up doing a lot of things on my own. And I used to be really proud of it until I went to college and I learned it was called hyperindependence, and it wasn't that great of a thing. I realized that as I grew up, I really struggled to ask people for help because I figured that I should be able to do it on my own. And in terms of my friendships, I'm always willing to drop everything I'm doing to help a friend in need, but whenever I need something, I'm not willing to ask for that help from my friends. And I'm trying to work on that as I've come to learn more about it. And I've also been coined as the mom friend of the group, so anytime something happens, I'm quick to spring into action. I'm quick to help out or do what I need to do. So I guess that has a lot to do with how I was raised."
680.0,702.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what has that process been like for you to kind of maybe put labels on some of these characteristics that you've been kind of noticing about yourself and feeling out how that has played into relationships? Yeah. What has that process been like to kind of work on that and improve that?
702.0,766.0,Subject,"So I guess I would say I learned more about it when I started college. And the thing is, up until this whole time, I thought it was just normal. I thought it was very normal until I started hearing about my other friends and their home lives, and how they don't go through the same things. And while everyone is different, I figured there were still some type of similarities within your friends, but I realized that I was just doing a lot of things on my own that I shouldn't have been, especially at a young age. And so I wanted to learn more about it because to me, what seemed normal was suddenly no longer as normal. So I wanted to just learn more about it to make sure that I understood more about myself, and then I could sort of-- what's the word? Just improve myself as a person in general because the more aware you are of yourself, I mean, the better. So yeah."
766.0,768.0,Interviewer,Yeah. I mean--
768.0,772.0,Subject,"I don't know if that answered your question. I feel like you asked something about relationships, but I can't remember."
772.0,801.0,Interviewer,"No, I was just saying what the process was like for you to kind of figure that out in college about yourself, and then maybe reflect back and work on it. I think you did answer that question. So could you say a little bit more maybe about the differences that you observed between your home life and your friends' home life? Isn't it so interesting to go to college and see how different everyone's home environment is?"
801.0,913.0,Subject,"Honestly, I would say the biggest change for me was middle school and high school because for elementary school, I went to school in my neighborhood. And I live on a Roosevelt Island, so it's pretty isolated. So you kind of know everyone. Everyone's your neighbor. Everyone's your friend. But when I went to middle school in the city, I went to school on the Upper East Side, and for me, it was different because it was a mostly white student body, and I was kind of one of the few people of color. And so it was a big adjustment because I went from a school where it was a super diverse school to a super not so diverse school. And I would see that-- particularly my white friends, they would have a lot more money. Their parents were willing to spend a lot more on them. They had nannies, or they had all these after school activities, and I kind of just went home after school, and I didn't really have much. So I felt I was just like, ""Oh, how come they have it easier?"" And I would wonder why, but at the same time, I'd have to remind myself that my parents kind of started from nothing here, and I should be more grateful of it. So same thing with high school. I went to a school on the Upper East Side also, and the same thing, mostly white student body population. And I guess I just saw that there is like a lot of privilege, and I didn't quite know how to go about it. And so for me, I thought the best thing to do would just be to try to fit in as much as I could. So I feel going to college, which was a lot more diverse-- sorry, you're a little fuzzy. I don't know if I cut off or not."
913.0,915.0,Interviewer,"No, no, no. I can still hear you. Sorry, I'm not sure--"
915.0,967.0,Subject,"Okay. Okay. Good. Yeah, so by the time I got to college, it was a really diverse group of students, and I just saw everyone was kind of doing their own thing. We had all these clubs with different groups and everyone getting together, and I was just like, ""Oh, this is kind of what my elementary school was like but just a lot bigger. And I think going through that experience with middle school and high school, I had a better experience in college in terms of that. It wasn't as clicky, I guess I could say. But granted, the schools I went to for middle school and high school were smaller. But it was refreshing. It was nice, and I think I definitely needed that kind of change in environment."
967.0,988.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. So in terms of, in college, your friend group that you created there, did you kind of observe differences in your friends' home environments compared to yours, or was that kind of less the case and so was more diverse?"
988.0,1037.0,Subject,"It's interesting because in middle school and high school, I was just like everyone had a much easier life, but when I got to college, I saw that people had way more struggles. And in that way, it was almost like relatable even though I wasn't necessarily going through what they were going through. In a way, we were just kind of there for each other. Sometimes if our families were acting a certain type of way, we could vent to each other. We could offer each other advice. So that was nice and definitely helped my perspective on things because I went from an environment where I thought I was having it bad to an environment where, oh, it's like you have it either just as bad or worse. Or some people are doing better too, and that's perfectly fine, but at least we just have each other for support."
1037.0,1061.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So maybe there was a wider range [crosstalk]. Yeah. That's so interesting. So we talked about some things that maybe you didn't love about the more maybe traditional mindset. What are some values that you really love and appreciate from kind of your upbringing that you try to carry forth with you?
1061.0,1140.0,Subject,"A big one for me is just kindness and respect, particularly with people that are older than you. But I think it applies to all ages. As long as someone is treating you right and they treat you with respect, I think you should do the same and match that energy. I also think you starting off with kindness can-- I guess it sort of sets the tone of a friendship or a relationship and if you don't get it back, then I know to not pursue that. And another thing with values? I guess hard work. I saw my parents working all the time, and while I want it-- while I enjoy putting in work, I eventually want my parents to be able to relax, so I'm hoping that I can put in some work so that they can relax because they've been working for most of their lives. I'm trying to think if there's any other thing. I would say, I also just value friendships and close family. I'm not necessarily close with my relatives like my extended family, but I am pretty close to my immediate family. So I do value the relationship that I have with them."
1140.0,1163.0,Interviewer,"Got it. So I was wondering if you also had kind of-- not your extended family, but just like a larger immigrant community around you or where you grew up? And if that was the case, how maybe that impacted your upbringing as well?"
1163.0,1276.0,Subject,"So I didn't get that particular experience. When I was about two years old, my dad was able to apply for a low-income housing program, and we got the application processed and approved, and we got located to, well, Roosevelt Island. And so there was a big building, and I think a portion of the apartments are meant for people-- it's meant to match up with your income. So if you make a certain amount, it's a certain percentage that you pay for rent. So within this community, there was no other Bengali families. It was diverse, but there was no one that necessarily looked like me, I would say. But regardless, it was still really nice to grow up in this environment because it was the diversity. It doesn't matter if they're not necessarily Bengali, but they're still-- meet people of color, and there's also other communities here. And I would say early on it was a bit more diverse, but now, it's getting a bit more gentrified. So I would say that's probably the biggest change for me in my environment now. But growing up in this community was really nice. It's super safe. My parents used to let me out, play by myself with my friends when I was in third grade. I know parents wouldn't do that now, but growing up in this environment, we can see why they did it. It was really safe. So I value that a lot because prior to-- the environment that both my sisters grew up in, they grew up in a not-so-great neighborhood in Jamaica, Queens. And so I think that's what prompted my dad to try to find a better environment for us, so yeah."
1276.0,1284.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That is interesting. So it sounds like the diversity in and of itself was supportive, even if the unity wasn't necessarily."
1284.0,1302.0,Subject,"Yeah. For me, growing up in that environment is great. I think for my parents, they would have wished to have someone that they were more familiar with or closer with, so. But they couldn't really find that here, but they were able to find it in other parts of the city, which is nice."
1302.0,1322.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's really great. Okay. So I'm thinking about more traditional versus maybe modern mindsets about certain other topics. So I was wondering if religion played a role in your upbringing at all, or how you kind of navigated that area?"
1322.0,1389.0,Subject,"Yeah. So my parents were both-- they still are. They're pretty religious. I'm Muslim. But while I grew up, I realized I didn't really practice anything. I didn't want to practice any of it. I don't know if that was just me being rebellious with my parents and me trying to be more assimilated with my friends, but I never really connected with religion like that. My mom knows it, but she doesn't talk about it because she's gotten a lot more religious within the last year or two. And so I think she kind of just hopes that I'll eventually get to that, but I don't see it happening at all. I know my older sister's pretty religious, or she tries to balance it. And my middle sister and I are on the same page in terms of that we don't really-- we kind of just go with the flow. We don't necessarily factor religion into our life as heavy as the rest of our family members."
1389.0,1398.0,Interviewer,"So you alluded to the last two years kind of being different. I was going to ask if maybe COVID impacted that at all, and if anyway how [inaudible]."
1398.0,1502.0,Subject,"Oh, with my mom I would say it had to do more with my grandparents. So her parents. I know my grandmother, she's back home, but she's, in my opinion, she's a difficult person. And she also is just very-- she's very traditional. So she wants to make sure that her children are traditional and they're passing those values on. So I guess she imposes a lot on my mom, and I think my mom felt guilty in a lot of ways, and she was like, ""You're right. I should be more religious."" And my grandfather actually died this past year from COVID, and I think after his death, my mom really picked up on religion because I think in her head if she were to pray and wish for him to have a helpful journey after his death, I think that brought her comfort and it was part of the grieving process. But it's still around. I mean, the death was in March sometime-- I think March or May. I can't remember, but it's still relatively recent. And yeah, it was hard. It was rough on her because-- oh, I mentioned my grandmother's back home, but my grandfather was actually here in New York, so. He lived with my uncle, so my mom would-- I guess she kind of just wished she saw him more often or she spent more time with him, so yeah."
1502.0,1521.0,Interviewer,"So in the religious kind of domain, do you feel that your dad kind of is on board with her mindset, or maybe does he align more with how you and your middle sister feel at the moment?"
