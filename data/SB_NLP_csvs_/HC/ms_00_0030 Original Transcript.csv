1.0,4.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
4.0,37.0,Subject,"Life has been pretty hectic lately. I'm in the middle of moving apartments, have some of the boxes behind me. I'm in the middle of switching jobs and looking for another job. I'm a bar tender. So yeah, also at my current job, there has been a lot of issues and things like that, so it's been getting a little stressful. So that's the reason why I'm looking. Other than that, I mean it's been generally okay."
37.0,46.0,Interviewer,Could you maybe say a little bit more about what issues you've been having at your current job and how that influenced your desire to switch jobs?
46.0,140.0,Subject,"Sure. So at my current job we've had a couple times-- well, more than a couple, it's become commonplace for us to run out of liquor. But we're working at a bar, so it's like how are you running a bar with no liquor? And as the bar tender, I get the brunt of the customer complaints. And the manager is the one who should be handling the restock, inventory, and things like that, but she isn't. And there's just been a lot of if there is a dispute between two of my coworkers or people aren't getting along, she doesn't handle it. She doesn't really mediate it. She kind of just watches it happen and, yeah, sits back, things like that. So I ended up doing-- I ended up writing an email to the corporate side of where I work, and they-- I didn't expect them to, but they took it very seriously and they started an investigation. So then that was freaking me out a little bit because I didn't think it would go that far where they would-- they just took me in two days ago for an interview and they asked me a bunch of questions, like, ""Did you witness so-and-so incident? What's the overall energy at the club?"" And yeah, so I finished the interview and she was like, ""Yeah, this sound like you work at a hostile work environment."" I was like, ""I wouldn't use that word."" She's like, ""Yeah, most people wouldn't because they're not aware. They wouldn't call it that."" So, yeah. [laughter]"
140.0,146.0,Interviewer,Wow. So how did that feel for you to kind of have that term assigned to this experience?
146.0,191.0,Subject,"It really opened my eyes to how much service workers are-- we're put under so much stress most of the time that when it comes to that and when we are under hostile work environment we're so unaware of it because we're just so used to people being hostile to us. We do have good days and good customers, but I feel like most of the time, as humans, we tend to focus on the negative things. So most of us have just gotten really good at, I guess, not internalizing the stress."
191.0,204.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So in your experience after this interview, did that kind of change the way that you're viewing your work in any way? How did that play out for you?"
204.0,254.0,Subject,"I mean I always viewed it in a way that-- I wouldn't say always. I would say over time I had stopped smiling. I would kind of just go in, turn my brain off, and do the work. And my manager, the one that I have problems with, she was like, ""Oh, well, why don't you smile anymore? You don't seem very happy,"" things like that. The reason, obviously, I can't say that. And when I learned of that, it just kind of confirmed, okay, this is what I've been feeling. I've been feeling that I'm reacting to a hostile work environment without using the words and without knowing what it is. And I could never put my finger on it, but that's what it was."
254.0,272.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So just taking a step back, how did it feel to have kind of that response be so serious to the claim that you were making? You mentioned that it was kind of initially intimidating. But yeah, how did you feel about that?"
272.0,319.0,Subject,"I felt heard. I felt pretty good to have someone actually take me seriously, because I'm fully aware of my position. I am just a bar tender. I'm just some dude to them that is their subordinate. And I just didn't expect them to take my words seriously. So I kind of view, maybe not the whole corporate end, but the one person who, one, asked me to write the email, started the investigation because of my email. She stayed in touch with me. It felt really good. It was like a sigh of relief."
319.0,332.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And so now that you felt heard in that way, where does that fit in to then how your kind of goal is to look for a new job or you're in that process right now?"
332.0,371.0,Subject,"Where does it fit in? I feel like when I'm looking for a new job now I have more things that I would require. There needs to be a sense of respect, where they're listening to what I have to say. They take advice. They take accountability; that's a big one. Yeah, it's not just like, ""Are the tips good?"" Now it's more about yeah, I do need to pay rent, but also there needs to be good quality of life there."
371.0,377.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So are you looking for jobs in a similar domain? What types of jobs anyone you looking for?
377.0,409.0,Subject,"Bartending jobs, just because-- I'm an artist, so I currently don't make money off-- not that much money off my art. I do commissions and things like that, but yeah, while I work on that part of my career, bartending is just to pay the bills. I'm looking in Lower East Side. I mean that's just mainly where I'm looking. Actually, tomorrow someone's helping me look for a job in Crown Heights, those two areas."
409.0,415.0,Interviewer,How about that. Can you tell me a little bit more about your art and how you got started with that and what type of art you do?
415.0,629.0,Subject,"Sure. So currently I'm a digital artist. I paint on the iPad and things like that. So my dad was an artist. He went to Art and Design High School, and he went to SVA for a little bit when it was time for him to go to college. Then he ended up joining the military when I was three. And I would always just see his paintings throughout the house. And he had his own-- he would paint in the garage every once in a while, and I thought it was pretty cool. And he influenced a lot of what inspires me to make art. So he always had these-- what are they called? The tapes, but they we're animated movies. You know the movie Akira and Studio-- he had Spirited Away on the Studio Ghibli DVDs and things like that. So I got into anime at a super young age, and I was watching Naruto and things like that when it was not cool at all. People made fun of me. And that, video games and things like that, I was the pioneer of that stuff. And so I do find it interesting now that that's the thing now. Everyone my age is into it. But anyway, yeah, so things like that would inspire me. So I make artwork. It's inspired by fantasy, but it also holds a place in realism. So I spend a lot of time working on my fundamentals and making sure that I capture the right colors or I'm getting the right light interaction, so if you were to look at this painting you'd be like, ""Oh, this looks pretty-- not realistic, but it looks like it could take place in whatever setting I've created.""  And I went to LaGuardia High School, but I didn't go for art. I went for music. And that time I was so-- I played the violin for seven years, and I wasn't really drawing. I would draw once in a while, but at that time I had just-- at that point, I had accumulated so much media and I'd taken in so many things and those are things that I really liked. But yeah, I played violin since fourth grade, got in for that. And then towards the end of high school-- yeah, it was my last year. I remember I started going to the galleries that the art majors had. So there is different majors for-- that's what we called them. I was music. There was art, dance, drama, and all the other stuff. So the art majors had galleries that I would look at, and something about really spoke to me. Something clicked for me, and I was like, ""I want to do that. I want to learn that.""  So yeah, after that I started drawing seriously. I started taking it a little bit more serious through college. I was an art major. I mean I am still in college. I'm an art major, but I mostly self-taught in terms of my fundamentals and just learning the practical stuff. How to paint and how to draw is mostly YouTube videos or just doing it on repetition over the years. And all of the theoretical stuff, like art history, art jargon, how to write about artwork is from classes, things like that. So, yeah."
629.0,640.0,Interviewer,That's so interesting. Wow. So at LaGuardia were you able to kind of switch tracks once you came to that realization? Or was it more that you had to stick it out?
640.0,674.0,Subject,"I could have switched. I actually did apply to switch my freshman year and my soph. Did I apply in soph? I think I missed it my freshman year and then I applied in my sophomore year. But those are the only two times that you can do it. And I didn't get in for art my sophomore year. So I was like, ""Okay, I guess I have to just stick it out."" And I remember there was one person, she was also an instrumental major, and then she switched to art. And then she ended up switching back to instrumental because she didn't like it. And I was like, ""Oh, that was a wasted spot. It should have been me."" [laughter]."
674.0,693.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, totally. Oh, my gosh, I can relate to that feeling. So in college, you've been an art major from the beginning. So how has that kind of impacted maybe your experience in college and your idea of where you want to go in the future?"
693.0,785.0,Subject,"My experience in college? I mean I'm not going to lie; I've been pretty jaded about college just because I feel like-- because I go to CUNY. I go to Brooklyn College. So the courses, I feel, aren’t hitting the mark in terms of what people need. Because I'm very focused on-- people want to learn how to draw. They don't want to learn-- they don't need to learn a bunch of terms and get tested on terms constantly and all the theoretical stuff. That's good, but I think you should have both ends. And it's skewed a lot more towards one than the other. I remember I ended up-- I just switched my major at one point to communication just because I was feeling lazy and I just wanted to get the degree because I hated it so much. [laughter] But I'm going back now. I ended up not only switching to art again, but I'm getting my BFA, which actually requires more classes. But it's just the possibility that it could open up more doors for me. Because I don't really know what I want to do in terms of my career yet. I have a few ideas, but I just think having the degree would open up a lot more even though there are a lot of artists in the industry who are working or they have gallery work, they don't have degrees. But I already made it this far, so I might as well."
785.0,800.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And sorry, I don't know very much about the art degree. So what kind of differences and opportunities do you see between the BA, BFA? How does that impact kind of future directions?"
800.0,889.0,Subject,"So the BFA is you do a lot more writing. Well, you learn how to write about your art.  You learn how to submit-- you learn about how the galleries work. Also, if you want to get your MFA, but that would lead into teaching and also high-quality gallery work. So yeah, I know a lot of galleries in New York and certain parts of the world do require you to have some type of degree, well, a BFA, I would say. As for BA, BA is more like-- it's like a general art degree you can go into. You can go to art handling. You can go into art history, which is another track. You can go from BA to MFA as well, it's just you would have to take a lot more of the classes that you would take it you did the BFA. And BFA requires that you take a lot of art history, whereas BA is more just you have to take every course in every discipline. So, for example, you have to take one sculpture course, one design course, one drawing course, one painting course. So you have to check off a bunch of boxes for that. BFA is not only that, but more art courses and more, I think, writing courses."
889.0,900.0,Interviewer,"Oh, interesting. Okay. So if you wanted to go more the gallery route, that is more kind of in line with the BFA."
900.0,902.0,Subject,That's more for BFA. Yeah. 
902.0,903.0,Interviewer,Okay. That makes sense.
903.0,958.0,Subject,"I don't think I want to go for the gallery route, but it's just like-- I learned a lot more from taking the capstone class. There is a capstone class for the BFA. For BA you don't have one. The capstone class is a yearlong class where, for the first semester, you talk about your ideas and what inspires you and you have to write a page about the culmination of all of the work that you want to make. And then the second half or the end of the first semester and the second semester are about actually making that work, putting it up. And then at the end everyone from the whole school can go and see your gallery work. And we do critiques throughout the semester and things like that. I learned a lot; really beneficial class."
958.0,969.0,Interviewer,Wow. That's so cool. [laughter] Wow. So you mentioned that you have some ideas about where you want to go. Would you mind sharing maybe some of those?
969.0,1146.0,Subject,"Sure. So right now I'm enrolled in a boot camp as well as taking regular classes. And the boot camp is by this guy who I've always watched his videos on YouTube. He's a digital painter. He went to Art Center. Art Center is like where the gods go for-- [laughter] that's known in the art community as the god tier of college. And what he does is make-- he takes all the lessons that he learned and makes it affordable for-- and crunches down all the work and is just very practical, like, ""This is just how you paint,"" basically. And that's what I've always been looking for. So I'm currently doing that in order to possibly become a concept artist or work--  So a concept artist is someone who if you have a movie or a video game or a book or something like that, you would come to them with an idea and you would list out everything that you want to be conveyed, everything that you want to be seen or whatever colors you want to use. And then they create pieces that aren’t exactly-- they're not polished, but they're developed enough that you're like, ""Yeah, that is perfect. That's what I want."" It's a little hard to explain without showing you concept art. But there is that. So you can do it for paintings of-- you can do portraits, character design. You can do environment design. There is a lot of different niches. There is weapon design, or there is another one I can't think of right now. But it also falls under visual development which is more like world building. So visual development is like concept art but on a grander scale. So it's like you have-- I don't know, let's say whoever designed Shrek or whoever wanted to make the movie Shrek, the vis-dev team would create a bunch of work designing the character and the environments, every single aspect that has ever been in that movie, someone painted it or drew it out multiple times. And they develop it over the course of the process of creating that movie. So I was thinking about going into that.  What else was I thinking? What was another idea I had? Oh, also I was thinking of going into the clothing world, the fashion world, but not designing clothes but designing logos and things to put on the clothes. So yeah, that, and was thinking of doing something with TikTok. I'm not sure yet. [laughter] But yeah, those are my ideas for now."
1146.0,1151.0,Interviewer,TikTok feels so enticing. Doesn't it? It's just waiting for someone to take it.
1151.0,1153.0,Subject,Exactly.
1153.0,1169.0,Interviewer,So this is kind of going back a little bit to your dad. So I'm just curious if your dad's influence relates at all to kind of the art that you're currently doing or that you see yourself doing? You mentioned he was a big inspiration for you.
1169.0,1230.0,Subject,"Yeah. So he was heavy into comics. And I'm not really that much-- I'm into comics, but more Japanese comics, manga. He was into American comics like DC, Marvel, and things like that. And his style is heavily influenced by that. And my style is heavily influenced by anime, manga, video games, things like that. So yeah, he's an influence in that sense in terms of he is basically the one that got me into it in the first place, I guess, indirectly, because he was trying to steer me towards comics but it didn't work that way. [laughter] Yeah. I think, because he doesn't really draw now. He just retired from the military now. He's going to social work, working on being a therapist and getting his master's degree and things like that. So yeah, I think that's the extent of where his inspiration comes in."
1230.0,1260.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's so cool. Wow. Social work as well. So my other thought is about how-- so this is something I'm always curious about regarding artists. Do you feel like being an artist impacts the way that you just perceive the world? Because you're talking about the colors and how you have to be very perceptive to get the correct color, does that impact how you just go around the world?"
1260.0,1263.0,Subject,Yeah. Is my camera-- it's kind of blurry. Right?
1263.0,1266.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It just got a little bit blurry, but [inaudible]."
1266.0,1465.0,Subject,"Yeah. I'm going to stop moving it so it can refocus. But anyway, yeah, absolutely. [laughter] I would say that my-- people think that when you're drawing it's all about your hands and it's muscle memory, like how to draw a giraffe. You make this circle and that circle and line, line, line. But not at all. It's all about your eyes, whatever you take in visually. Building up a visual reference of giraffes would benefit you more than repeating the same process of drawing a giraffe. Because if you think about it, you'd only be able to draw a giraffe from one angle if you memorize how to draw a giraffe that way. Whereas if you study forms and you break whatever you're looking at down in your head in terms of like, ""Okay, I see the neck is a cylinder, but it's rotated this way. Then the body is an ellipse that's rotated that way."" You have to observe the world around you in a certain way constantly. Yeah, so you definitely have to use a different part of your brain, I guess, or at least keep it on. Keep that part of yourself on at all times. And after a while-- it doesn't become tiring, it's just how I move through the world. Same thing with light and color.  Something about painting. When I learned how to paint they were talking about-- well, drawing and painting. So there is a saying where when you're drawing you should draw like a painter and when you paint you need to paint like a sculptor.  And what that means is when you draw don't worry about detailed lines and getting the perfect outline of something. Because you're looking at it on a 2D level. So the only things that would-- the things that read the most when using just a pencil or a pen or whatever are shadow and light. So if you find the shapes of the shadow, then you're going to be able to accurately depict what you're drawing and make it look 3D although it's on a 2D plain. Painting, the same thing except painting like a sculptor is like you're trying to carve out the-- that and incorporating color. You're trying to carve out the shapes of the color. So if you have one color next to another color, the eye is going to read that as the relationship between those two colors instead of being like, ""Oh, that's just that color."" Let's say you have the color red in a painting. That red isn't just red. It's probably red mixed with whatever other color that's next to it. Or it's probably the bounced light of another color or it's the shadow of another color. There is so many different color relationships, like complimentary colors, tertiary color relationships. It's all about composition and things like that. There's so many things that go into it. [laughter] I don't know if I answered your question."
1465.0,1482.0,Interviewer,"No, no, totally. This is just so cool. Okay. So when you're saying paint like a sculptor, that's kind of identify those places where those colors are interacting to kind of have more of a 3D understanding. Is that kind of right?"
1482.0,1495.0,Subject,Yeah. It's like you're looking at the shapes. You're looking at both the shape of the color and what color is underneath the mixture of whatever you're looking at.
1495.0,1516.0,Interviewer,"So I'm curious with this perceptive eye that you always have going about your day, if that leads into other aspects of your life in terms of maybe relationships or-- do you have that kind of perceptiveness in other areas?"
1516.0,1654.0,Subject,"I do. I remember there've been a couple times where-- I forget what we were doing. I think I was out with my friends and we were looking at-- I don't remember. But there were times-- there have been times where I've looked at something and no one else noticed. The reflection of something was different. The color of something was different than another color, and I was like, ""Yeah, this is reflecting off of that."" And they're like, ""What the hell? How could you tell that?"" [laughter] And yeah, I find it interesting that there are times like that. And relationships, I think-- I noticed whenever I talk about how I perceive things, it's not common. So I find that it makes me seem more interesting, I guess, when I go on dates. [laughter] I talk about when I draw and paint and things like that. And they're like, ""Oh, my God. He's so artsy."" [laughter] So yeah, I mean I try not to do that too much because I don't want to take advantage. [laughter]  But let me think. What else does it change? I mean just going through my daily life, walking down the street makes me think of-- I can see a scene in my head just based on looking at something, and I'll take a mental snapshot of it and be like, ""I would paint that."" Why would I paint that? Because this, this, and this. And I'd run through the reasons why this scene works and I think of all the colors that I'm looking at. So I incorporate things that I thought of in that moment and I think of like, ""Okay--"" whenever I sit down to paint, I think of the things that I was observing at that time and then incorporate them into my next work. I don't even know if I answered your question. I'm trying to think of times when I've done it. I know I have, but I can't really describe a specific time."
1654.0,1679.0,Interviewer,I guess I'm just thinking in kind of a concrete sense you have this ability to be very detail oriented in your perception of people. So if that can be kind of applied maybe more abstractly? Do you notice people's kind of emotional reception or things? Or do you just feel perceptive kind of interpersonally as well?
1679.0,1779.0,Subject,"Well, I do feel like I can kind of tell what a person is thinking or feeling based on their facial expressions or their body language, things like that. Yeah. 100% I would say that I'm more perceptive because of that. There are times when-- I was actually talking to Shana about this. Sometimes I can have a sense that something will happen before it happens. It has nothing to do with art though. I've had times-- there was one time my friend-- I hadn’t seen her in a couple days bit we had just been talking, but I was about to go to sleep and I was like, ""Why do I feel like my stomach feels weird?"" And I had this bussing in my head, and something told me that she wasn't feeling well. And I was like, ""This doesn't make any sense. I'm just going to go to sleep. I'm not going to text her at 12:00 in the morning."" Then the next day I was like, ""All right. Let me just see what this is about."" So I text her and ask if she's okay. She's like, ""Yeah, I have COVID."" [laughter] She just caught COVID yesterday and she had just taken the test last night and things like that. And I was like, ""That is crazy because I kind of knew that you weren't feeling well."" She had a fever and everything. So I had a couple moments like that where I either react to something or right before it happens, or I can tell something will happen a little bit before. "
