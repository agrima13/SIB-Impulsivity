2.0,6.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,22.0,Subject,"Things have been okay. Just a little stressed out over just adult things, I guess, like finding a job, how much money I can make, maximizing my time. And yeah, basically what I'm going through right now."
22.0,26.0,Interviewer,So you're trying to find a job right now?
26.0,67.0,Subject,"Yeah, specifically something that benefits me in the long run, so in terms of my career. So I want to be a data analyst, so I need a job that either helps pay for a master's, or something that could give me some quality data analysis experience, so that way I could apply to a PhD. Really depends on, I guess, what's available, and what will, I guess, allow me to join. But yeah, that's the big issue."
67.0,75.0,Interviewer,So what steps kind of have you been taking so far to move this process along?
75.0,145.0,Subject,"Well, I was just fixing my résumé. And so the two things that I would say that I have done that aren't the normative things that people do, I would say is, so I'm part of the American Statistical Association. So I join these meetings every now and then, so I can talk about that. But also I think that-- sorry, it was in my head, and for some reason it slipped out. Something that I do. Oh, and I'm part of this Coursera program sponsored by Google. It's to help you learn data analysis. So even though I've had some training in my undergrad years, I decided to do this as another certificate to say it's just like, ""Okay. This person has, I guess, what Google thinks he should know as a data analyst."" So yeah."
145.0,152.0,Interviewer,"Cool, wow. So how did you kind of come to the decision this is what you wanted to do?"
152.0,226.75,Subject,"So it was back when I was in undergrad. I really liked psychology, but I was also previously aware of if you don't have a specialty in psychology, it's very hard to find a job. So I was just like, ""Okay. What interests me besides psychology?"" And that's when I started taking math courses. And I hated math courses. I still hate math courses. But I like math, and statistics specifically. And so learning from my friends was always really fun. And I figured, ""I can pursue this as a career, considering how much enjoyment I get out of it."" And I guess I didn't let my feelings towards my classes navigate that. But yeah, no, I guess that's where it came from. I knew I enjoyed math, despite not liking my teachers and courses. So yeah. It's not--"
226.75,227.0,Interviewer,What--
227.0,249.0,Subject,"--very specific towards data analysis, because there's a lot more to the story. But I guess that's where the general interest came from, because I knew I had a very-- I was very curious and just overall interests in the field, so."
249.0,252.0,Interviewer,Can I hear a little bit more of what's behind the story?
252.0,384.0,Subject,"Sure, sure. So specifically, I wanted to do quantitative psychology. And it's not that far from data analysis. But I guess things have changed a bit. So I started out with that because my aunt was diagnosed with schizophrenia a long time ago, and that's what-- I was just in college, and when that happened I was shocked, because that was the first time I was learning about certain mental disorders. I was like, ""I need to do more research."" So I took psych courses. And as the years went by, I became interested in that, and really invested within the content of mental disorders. And as I mentioned, my friends, they were real statisticians working at Mount Sinai, working at NYU. They were really far into their career, but I guess since I was friends with them as they started, it was nice to see them talk about how they enjoyed their time there. And so the more I started talking, the more they started to teach me, and specifically what they were doing and the projects they were on and stuff like that. And so I guess that shifted me towards data analysis, because I did enjoy listening. I did enjoy learning it. And yeah, I mean, it was always between that or a quantitative psychologist, who I consider basically a data analyst, just from a different context. But yeah, I guess that's where the story really started. Yeah."
384.0,395.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. Wow. So you mentioned that you were interested in psychology, but that you didn't pursue it because you felt like you had to have a specialty in psychology."
395.0,396.0,Subject,"Right, [crosstalk]--"
396.0,398.0,Interviewer,Could you say a little bit more about what that means?
398.0,557.0,Subject,"Yeah, so I guess when I first decided to-- so when I came into college, I was a MD and on the MD track, and it wasn't very interesting to-- when I was taking these courses, they didn't really fulfil this [intellectual?] curiosity that I had. I was just there to memorize, and I didn't like that. I guess maybe it was because it was so fundamental, the concepts and everything, that it was hard for me to connect with the material. And when I took psychology, I guess because it connected to real life so easily, that's why I was just like, ""Oh wow, I can take from this experience. I can take from this person I saw on the train."" It was very interactive. And I guess that was enough to draw me. And when I told my parents that I was changing my majors to psychology, they were like, ""Oh, you're not going to find a job."" So I did more research, and it's true. It's very hard to find a job with a psychology major in a lot of places, career-wise. You can get a job right out of your bachelor's for data analysis; accounting, etc. But research is a little bit-- I mean, not research; psychology is a little bit harder. And yeah, and then when I did research, and I liked research, it was, I guess, a rabbit hole for my interest, because I just got deeper into it. And yeah, and I guess that's where I also developed my interest in stats and that whole field. So yeah, I don't know if I answered it as clearly as I would like to, but basically, it's just hard to find a job. It's harder to find a job with just a bachelor's in psychology. And so I figured, might as well get a minor in stats and let's see how that goes, I guess."
557.0,583.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. And maybe you can marry them at some point, your psychology interest with your stat interest, maybe down the road. So could you tell me a little bit more about the way in which your family situation was kind of impacting your interest, but also maybe just your school life in general?"
583.0,663.75,Subject,"Sure. Well, I guess I come from-- I'm not a first-generation student. I think I'm a second-generation student. Yes, because my mom got her master's. So that being said though, they very much are immigrant families. They came when they were very young to this country, so they're still traditional in their beliefs. And they thought that it would be best if I was a doctor. Since early childhood, they put it in my head. And when I came to college, that's what I thought I wanted. I took courses, and I was like, ""This is not what I want at all."" Don't get me wrong; it's cool. All the material's cool, but it's not something that-- I wouldn't be happy investing 20-plus years in. So I was like-- yeah, I'm sorry. Your question was regarding how my family feels towards my education, or--?"
663.75,664.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, just how--"
664.0,665.0,Subject,Can you repeat?
665.0,682.0,Interviewer,"--your family and anything that may have been going on in your family, or their opinions, may have impacted your experience in college and kind of directing you towards different activities or pushing you to explore different things, anything like that."
682.0,832.0,Subject,"I mean, no. I mean, they were just that-- they were hard set on me being a doctor. And so when I changed my focus to psychology, I didn't know what it was that I wanted to do. But I just knew that I liked the field. And then little by little, I learned, ""Oh, I could become a doctor, but not the doctor that you are imagining."" And yeah, I guess it influenced me up to a certain point. And then I guess I spoke up for myself and advocated enough for them to understand that it's okay that I'm not-- I guess in a way they were living vicariously through me, so I had to stop it right at the bud, I guess. But yeah, that's basically it. And the other experiences that they may have influenced, which I appreciate greatly, was my mom was a club president or something, and she talked about her time at John Jay and how they basically took trips. And I guess the rules were a lot different and less strict back then. But apparently, she was able to take ski trips and order food all the time on behalf of the-- on behalf of the club. And so I kind of took that as, ""Okay. I'll try the same."" And I did. And I didn't get to take the trips, because there was a lot of paperwork. But yeah, it was fun, not abusing, but taking the money from the school and just utilizing it in a semi-selfish way. I didn't order for myself, but I would order for a whole group of people. But it's nice, just considering who the school president was. I don't know. It just felt nice."
832.0,858.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that is nice. Kind of maybe giving yourself and your friends a treat from kind of working so hard. That is nice. So thinking a little bit about this advocacy moment that you had with your parents, what was that like for you to kind of redefine that dynamic and kind of speak up for yourself?"
858.0,1058.0,Subject,"I mean, it's hard. It's still going. They didn't necessarily receive it well. They still don't. Actually, since we're on the subject, part of it is-- part of this issue even extended to my sister, because-- and I know the interview's about me, but real quick, my sister, she got into this program called Posse. I don't know if you know what that is, but basically, they pay for your school tuition and board. And she got in, but the catch is they send you to the school that they think matches you best. And so she wanted to go to-- my family was riding on her going to Pennsylvania for school, but she got into a school in Chicago. And so this whole dilemma rose up because it became real that she was actually possibly moving away from everybody. And I've already created some distance between my parents, unintentionally, because I have been advocating for myself, and that means spending less time with them, focusing on myself, or focusing less on my family and more on my career or just what I wanted to do. Before, it was playing video games or hanging out with my friends, and now it's more shifted towards career. So to me, it feels like it's more justified, but before it wasn't. It was more of I wanted to be out with my friends; I wanted to party; I wanted to go to bars; just mid-age adult stuff. So when she got in, they did not receive the news well, and my sister ended up turning down the offer. And so yeah. Yeah, and basically, my mom, she basically told us that she doesn't care what happens to us anymore; we're on our own, and we're good to take care of ourselves. And actually, that's why I couldn't go yesterday. Or rather, I didn't realize it, just because I had spent the whole weekend trying to comfort my sister. Because she told it to my sister, so my sister really broke down from that. It really impacted her a lot. And so yeah, that's why. The days flew by. I didn't really even notice them go by. So again, sorry about that. It won't happen again. It was just very circumstantial. And I understand that time is very important, especially as a researcher, so I really apologize for that."
1058.0,1078.0,Interviewer,"No, really no need to apologize. Trust me, all the time, I reschedule for people. This is no big deal. I'm there every day. So I don't want you to feel bad about it. You're doing kind of us a favor by giving us your time and participating, so you never have to apologize for a reschedule, and I appreciate you giving me the heads-up."
1078.0,1126.0,Subject,"So yeah, that's basically that situation with my family. In terms of advocacy, it's a double-edged sword, because it almost means that I have to be independent for myself, like completely independent for myself, versus them accepting that I'm changing. And this applies to my sister as well. It's just hard to accept that change. And so I guess advocacy is equal unto completely separating myself."
1126.0,1149.0,Interviewer,"Wow, that sounds like such a difficult time for your family. So I just kind of want to make sure that I'm understanding all of the parts. So do you feel like if you did what they want, they would be treating you differently at this point, compared to--?"
1149.0,1150.0,Subject,Of course.
1150.0,1154.0,Interviewer,Okay. And same for your sister?
1154.0,1155.0,Subject,"Yeah, of course."
1155.0,1173.0,Interviewer,"So could you just say a little bit more about why this opportunity in Chicago was so devastating for your family, given that it seems like a really wonderful kind of breakthrough academic moment for your sister?"
1173.0,1336.0,Subject,"Sure. So for my sister-- so the way that my parents put it was that they were planning to move to Pennsylvania because it's cheaper there, and it's not too far away from home. It's not too far away from family. But at the same time, it's a nice start, like a good separation. And I guess they look forward to starting anew. And there's nothing wrong with that. You're adults. You've spent your entire lives working. You should have that opportunity. But I think it could be done in a better fashion. And they saw her getting accepted into Chicago as in her choosing instead of her being given the opportunity. I don't know if that makes sense. But they were like, ""Why would--"" they're like, ""Why would you go there if the plan all along was to go to Pennsylvania?"" Not completely remembering or understanding that it was never her complete choice to begin with. There's a catch-22 here. It's a pretty big one too. And I guess that's what it was. It was the surprise that she would take it, even though the plan was to go to Pennsylvania. And again, the issue was also, from my sister's end-- and I guess because I'm younger-- I don't know what it is exactly, but I understood that-- I mean, from what I understood of my sister was that she wasn't-- she's just a very shy and soft-spoken person. So to me, it was she didn't tell them she's 100% committed to whatever school that they gave her, simply because she's just the type of person to not brag about something just because if it doesn't happen she's going to be more heartbroken. She's a sensitive person, so it's like she would rather pull it off like, ""I wasn't planning on going there anyway,"" if she didn't get into the final interviews and stuff. So I understood that. I guess I should have told them to keep that in the back of their heads, but. But yeah, that's basically it."
1336.0,1354.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes sense. Oh, that's so hard. So what has it been like for you, or what has it looked like for you, to be stepping into that kind of comforting role for your sister during this really hard time?"
1354.0,1417.0,Subject,"I mean, it's been good and bad. Bad in the sense that I felt very guilty, just because-- she's six years younger than me, and she's about to graduate into college, but back when we were kids, she would always want my attention, and I never appreciated it as much as I do now. And I felt like I neglected her for too long, and so I'm really trying to pick up the slack as an older brother, as a friend, as a mentor. I'm trying to be all these things for her because-- I mean, it's just like there's just a lot more care into it. And so that's why I feel kind of guilty. But it's great for my relationship with her, because who doesn't want to be close to their sibling? Yeah."
1417.0,1465.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure, but I do feel that it's possible that you're not alone in that sentiment as it relates to older brother/younger sibling dynamics, just based on maturity levels and everything. So hopefully, you know that you're not the only one who may have felt that you weren't as present as you would have wanted back in the day, but I think-- I don't know. It seems really wonderful that you're stepping up in this way for her now. And does she have a support system outside of you that is kind of helping her during this time, or what does her kind of social circle look like right now?"
1465.0,1533.0,Subject,"They're high school kids. I hate all of her friends except for like two people. I wish it was better, but I think she has enough of a support group. She has myself. She has her cousins. She has my girlfriend, who talks to her regularly. She has one of my friends too, who is almost a spitting image of me, but in a different-- not spitting image; in terms of character, I mean. We're very alike. So she has someone like that. And yeah, so I feel like she has more than what I had in regards to a support group. So I think she'll be more than just fine. I like to consider myself okay, so I think she'll be-- I think she'll be just as okay, if not better. And yeah, so I think she'll be fine, yeah, because she has enough people supporting her."
1533.0,1551.0,Interviewer,"So how does the dynamic work between your girlfriend and your sister? You mentioned that they speak a lot. Do you feel like that's kind of almost a second sibling for your sister, or not quite? How is that?"
1551.0,1604.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah. I mean, so yeah, I would consider her like her-- I would say she treats her like a younger sister. I mean, I guess that's just how her and I roll. I don't know if it's because I'm an older brother, but in the group-- there's always a mom of the group, and I'm the dad, and she's the mom. That's literally how it works. I'll make sure you stop drinking. I'll carry you if I have to. That's how we work, and that's how we treat all of our friends, and this includes my sister. So we very much do act like older siblings to my sister."
1604.0,1625.0,Interviewer,"That's so nice. So okay, thinking about this situation maybe going forward, how do you feel like this would play out? Do you feel like this is kind of a really rough patch that will blow over, or do you feel like this is the turning point that's going to determine a new course for you and your sister?"
1625.0,1627.0,Subject,For my sister's relationship with me?
1627.0,1631.0,Interviewer,"No, sorry. For your guys' relationship with your parents."
1631.0,1726.0,Subject,"Oh, that's really hard to say. I really wish it was easier to say that it was going to blow over, but my mom is a very strong-willed person, and it really feels like she kind of gave up on us. And, I don't know, it's really hard to take back words that are as-- unintentional as they might be, it's really hard to take back the words that she said. And so maybe she can go forward, but I don't think I could ever go forward, or at least not right now. And I know that my sister feels the exact same way. It just hurts. And yeah, I think the only way that we can go forward is once we start living on our own and separating. And I guess that space and it heals us in a way. And maybe then I'll be able-- or both of us will be able to come back and just say, ""We forgive you,"" and stuff like that. But yeah, I don't think there's a easy fix to this, and I don't think there's a-- there's just so much turmoil in my household right now, that it's really hard."
1726.0,1735.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, so do you feel that that is adding stress or pressure to your whole job process that you're going through right now?"
1735.0,1736.0,Subject,For sure.
1736.0,1736.75,Interviewer,Yeah?
1736.75,1737.0,Subject,Sure. I want--
1737.0,1738.0,Interviewer,Like it--
1738.0,1779.0,Subject,"I want two jobs now, just because if I get kicked out at any moment, I need money. So at this point now, I'm just like, ""Do I prioritize money or career?"" So I don't know. I'm just like, ""$16 an hour doesn't compare to $25 an hour."" So yeah, unfortunately, $16 an hour are the research jobs that I ended up finding that might potentially help me with my career. So it was just like-- yeah."
1779.0,1810.0,Interviewer,"Well, I mean, I'm sure that even in industry data analysis job would later potentially be applicable to research interests. So I don't know. At least my perspective on this would be that it's not detrimental at this point, if you're within the same field, to go for a more higher-paying job, because the skill set seems transferable. But what do you think?"
1810.0,1837.0,Subject,"I mean, I agree with you. I just need to make the most amount of money that I can within a short span. And so that's part of the issue. And then I have these side business ideas that I have, but they don't really pay off until two years. I don't know if you know anything about NFTs, but I'm [crosstalk]--"
1837.0,1838.75,Interviewer,"Very little, yeah."
1838.75,1839.0,Subject,It's [okay?].
1839.0,1841.0,Interviewer,Feel free to tell me about it.
1841.0,1853.0,Subject,Sure. So do you know what an NFT stands for? No? Okay. So it stands for a non-fungible token. And so--
1853.0,1857.0,Interviewer,I just learned the word fungible like four days ago.
1857.0,1978.0,Subject,"Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's a really new thing, so it's a-- I mean, I'm sure you've heard of the news of people just going crazy with the memes. And the process is called minting. And that process is converting those digital files into an NFT that could be sold or stored anywhere, in whatever NFT database you have. But basically, it just means it's a unique object that can be sold for X amount of money. And an object is very general, because it could be a video, it could be a painting, it could be a portrait. I don't know. It could be a membership pass, because there are groups that sell their passes as NFTs. But basically, my friends and I are self-employed developers, and we're in the process of making NFTs for these video games. And once we're able to sell those, the more that we sell, the more that we can-- it's easier for us to afford land on these platforms. And in this land, we can then develop games, or we can hold on to the land and sell it once the platform grows bigger. But that takes time, so it's a lot of extra time, and it has a great potential to make a lot of money, but again, it'll take like two years maybe; a year if we're lucky. So yeah, that's basically [crosstalk]--"
1978.0,1983.0,Interviewer,So what is the process like in terms of making an NFT?
1983.0,2122.0,Subject,"Well, the specific process for me is-- so we're using this platform called Sandbox. And basically, you use NFTs, I guess, as characters, and you can make video games. You can make online social clubs and stuff like that. In this specific platform, Atari has a plot of land. Snoop Dogg has his own plot of land where he has celebrities come [at?]. I'm serious. It's crazy. It's really cool. And it makes sense for the future, because everything is more available-- a lot of things are more available online. So even our economy is, I guess, moving away from traditional banks and using cryptocurrencies and, I don't know, people are using stocks to make money. So it makes sense that it went in this direction. Anyway, we use this platform to basically make pixelated characters, and it's exactly how you would think it is. You just use a program. You have a 3D plane, and you just put blocks and make pixels, and you develop your characters. And so then after you develop your character, you save the file, and then you upload it through the platform onto their market. And that's when it gets sold as characters. And so whenever you develop these characters, you have the option of making, let's say, 20. So that means 20 games will be able to hold your characters, granted that, hopefully, there's thousands of games, right, making your characters more valuable in that sense."
2122.0,2126.0,Interviewer,"Oh. Oh wait, I kind of-- oh, that makes sense."
2126.0,2135.0,Subject,"Right? So that's the whole idea behind NFTs being unique and specifically for this platform, right?"
2135.0,2140.0,Interviewer,"So there's kind of an artistic element too, if I'm kind of hearing that correctly, right?"
2140.0,2141.0,Subject,"Yes, yes, yes."
2141.0,2149.0,Interviewer,"That's so cool. Do you guys, you and your friends, have any kind of artistic-y side or background?"
2149.0,2256.0,Subject,"Yeah, I used to paint a lot. I actually used to want to be an artist growing up. And so I mean, I went through high school, even after school-- I was friends with the art teacher, so I would bring my stuff, and I would do art in her room when I wasn't either playing sports or in model UN and stuff like that. So that was a nice-- it's a nice hobby to have. And one of the people on our team is an actual artist. He sells commissions and stuff like that. And my other friend is an upcoming coder. So in that regard, I guess he's trying to figure out if there's a way to make it easier, by code, to make these NFTs or, I guess, self-design them, if that makes any sense. Generate them automatically. And that's about it. I would say that we like to engage in different cultures too, so I guess that also gives us a heads-up. So I don't know. We actually like going to museums, watching different forms of art, anime. It's not just your stereotypical cartoons and stuff like that. Yeah."
2256.0,2259.0,Interviewer,That's so cool. That is so cool. Wow.
2259.0,2260.0,Subject,Thank you.
