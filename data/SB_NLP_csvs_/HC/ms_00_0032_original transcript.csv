2.0,5.0,Interviewer,All right. So how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,48.75,Subject,"Productive, or busy. I've been doing a lot of cleaning out of my house, refreshing my house. So me and my husband have been moving things out, putting new things in. Even today, he helped me build my new desk, which was complicated because it was a L-shaped desk, but we got through it. Other than that, everything's pretty much fine. I mean, I could say that right now. I have to tell you, side note, my husband right now is currently having eye surgery. I hope everything works out okay. I know. I know. [laughter]"
48.75,49.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk].
49.0,100.75,Subject,"After this Zoom, I have to go pick him up because he might not be able to see for a couple of hours. But it's a routine surgery to relieve pressure from behind the eyes, so it should be okay. And he's in the age group of it-- he's in his late 40s. So yeah. But other than that, everything else seems to be okay. My son is doing summer camp. My parents are enjoying their senior-citizen summer camp because I got to put all these people in summer camp so they can leave me alone [laughter] so I can get work done. But nothing too really significant sticks out as anything. Oh, I turned 40. That's about it. [laughter] But that was earlier this month."
100.75,101.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk] happy birthday.
101.0,151.0,Subject,"[crosstalk]. Thank you. That's the only big event. I'm actually waiting for next month because my family will be going on our first vacation since after COVID. And we're going to Bahamas. I'm excited. Oh, my gosh. We haven't been there in three years. So we're ready for an actual extended-- this is going to be not our first vacation, but our first week-long vacation. And we could actually call it a vacation because we'll be away for eight days, seven nights. So it's going to be fantastic, and my family deserves it. [laughter] I can say that. Yeah. [inaudible]."
151.0,152.0,Interviewer,Sorry about that.
152.0,155.0,Subject,"[crosstalk]. I was like, ""Did I answer fully?"""
155.0,163.0,Interviewer,Yeah. 100%. Yeah. Thank you. So what inspired the move and the rearrangement/refresh of the house?
163.0,263.0,Subject,"My husband keeps telling me that I turned 40, and I flipped a switch. He's right. I just started looking at things, and I was like, ""Oh, my gosh."" I had things that I bought in my 20s that I'm like, ""I really don't need this anymore."" I'm in a new decade. I just wanted the refresh because I feel refreshed. I think that's what it is. I was so nervous to turn 40. And then I turned 40, and I'm like, ""I'm young enough to have fun but old enough to know better."" It's a great age. A lot of people complain about middle age, middle age. And I think that's mostly because they're not fulfilling their lives. They're not doing the things that's making them feel good in their lives. And I actually don't feel that way. You build up all this anxiety because you listen to all these people's opinions. And I'm like, ""But I'm not there."" I got married. I have my son. I love my career. My parents are healthy and nagging me still. It's great. So my life is-- I don't want to say full. It's grand. [laughter] I got a lot on my plate. But there's so much still more that I want to do. And I don't have any expectations. I'm just happy to see what's the next steps."
263.0,272.0,Interviewer,And so how was that process for you kind of getting through that initial phase of anxiety and kind of realizing that that's not true to maybe how you're feeling now?
272.0,393.0,Subject,"It was weird because-- so on my actual birthday, that day, I did nothing. I was like, ""I do things every day. I take care of so many people. I want to do nothing."" And that was the day that I realized, ""I'm happy. I'm not fretting. I don't have any health issues. I don't really even have any financial worries."" Me and my husband, we're in a really good place. We busted our asses-- oh, excuse me, busted our butts, busted our asses [laughter] to really get back, to really pull our family back to where we were supposed to be out of the COVID hole. And so I prayed for a lot of things, and I'm counting my blessings now. So on that day, it was a day of reflection for me where I was able to kind of go through each category of my life and really assess it. And I'm like, ""I'm healthy. My bills are paid. My son is happy. My husband's happy. We're still together. We made it through COVID, and we're still together. My parents are good. My friends are good."" All my friends, we're all turning 40 or 45. Like, ""No, you can be miserable or you can embrace it."" And I decided to just take a big bite and embrace it. And I feel so good. I was like, ""Wow. What are people talking about?"" But I understand that if you're just not at the place that you want to be at the time that you're either having a milestone birthday, that's when you're going to feel miserable. I don't feel miserable at all. I feel fantastic turning 40. [laughter]"
393.0,405.0,Interviewer,That is so good to hear. Yeah. Could you tell me a little bit more about kind of your job and some of those other career aspects that are sustaining you and fulfilling you at this point in your career?
405.0,585.0,Subject,"Well, my career, okay. So I appreciate my career so much more now because I am able to do it. Okay. So first of all, I am a hairstylist, but I have a specialty niche. So I only work with clients that have obsessive-compulsive hair-pulling disorder, which is called trichotillomania. Well, that's the majority of my clients. I do have some clients that also have other autoimmune diseases and alopecia. But my main bread and butter are the ladies that I help by making them hairpieces and help treating their hair that have trichotillomania. During COVID, I had to close. I could not physically help them anymore. So it was a lot of Zoom consultations and prayer and mailing pieces to them and just trying to build connections through the internet, which was-- it's hard to actually teach someone step by step how to properly round brush and blow dry their hair. [laughter] I could tell you, but you have to have the hands to do it. So now, being able to fully operate, to see my clients and interact with them and even listen to each individual story of how they've recovered from COVID, or recovered through COVID, it has been so fulfilling. It's just like, ""I can do this every day."" And even before COVID, I've always loved doing hair. I've always loved hair, period. But because of what I do, the specialty of what I do, and I help people either grow back in their hair or I put hair on them, and that transformation is such a benefit to me. I live for that. I live for the results. [laughter] So going through the process of, first of all, they're usually referred to me by their doctor or their oncologist or their psychiatrist or a psychologist. Then they have to come in, meet me, get over that awkward first consultation, then build a trust to work with me. And then from there, we're doing the treatments. We're following the program. But when the results come, it's just like nirvana. You can't bottle that feeling. I wish I could. I wish I could do like 30 consultations. Like, ""Here's the feeling of nirvana that you're going to have when the results come."" You can't. All you could do is just hope for the best. And, oh, when the best comes, it's like, ""Yes."" [laughter] I treasure that feeling."
585.0,594.0,Interviewer,"That's such amazing work, I mean, first of all. So I mean, yeah. Thank you and congratulations, I guess, for that really, I guess, meaningful--"
594.0,596.0,Subject,21 years. 21 years. Awesome. Yeah.
596.0,611.0,Interviewer,Wow. Wow. That's amazing. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on kind of why that first meeting with the clients can be kind of difficult or awkward from [crosstalk]?
611.0,780.0,Subject,"Okay. Usually, I mean, it's closed doors, so they're having a personal one-on-one meeting with me. And it's awkwardness on both sides. The awkwardness for me is I never want to make a person feel nervous or overwhelm them with too much information because I can go real technical real quick. And now I'm throwing words at you that you've probably never even heard before. You don't care about your follicular density. You don't care about that. [laughter] But I have to talk to you about it, and I have to phrase it in a way that it's still fun, and you'll absorb it. So that is the awkwardness on my end. The awkwardness on my clients' end - the awkwardness that I actually care about more - is just them being able to show their situation to another person. They've shown it to the doctor; that's a different situation. With doctors, we have to trust them. Doesn't matter if it's awkward or not. But I am not a doctor, but I still will be performing treatments on you. And I want you to feel as comfortable as possible to remove your hat or your existing wig or your scarf, whatever you're using to hide your hair situation. You have to remove that and allow me to now look inside, and we can have an actual discussion. And then also, I've had clients that were just scared to ask questions only because they've been to other salons, and it's just intimidating. And I'm just, ""No, this is the place where you sit, you ask questions, and you find out as much as you can about your hair because you can be growing in hair, but we want you to grow in healthy hair, healthy strands."" And everybody's hair is different. I don't care if it's two different people that have straight hair. It doesn't matter. Your straight hair might be finer than the next person's straight hair. Or maybe it's more porous, so it's more susceptible to lightening in the sun faster. So you'll get sun-kissed highlights faster. That means that your pores are open. And if you're susceptible to lightening, you're susceptible to damage. So there's many different ways to treat different heads. So I try to just make sure people are comfortable, and they know that they can ask any question, big or small, smart or dumb, does not matter. I want you to fully understand what we're going to be doing together if you do choose to come into the program and actually work with me and my team."
780.0,802.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah. No, that makes a lot of sense. And at what point in kind of their, I guess, disorder course are they when they come to you? You mentioned earlier that they are maybe recovered. Are they fully recovered? How does it work kind of in tandem with their condition?"
802.0,920.0,Subject,"So with the trichotillomania-- because it's different for autoimmune or a person that's recovering from cancer or alopecia. With trichotillomania, it is an ongoing process. So even if the person actually grows their hair back-- because, usually, what I do is I make the hairpieces, and I apply it to the hair. And I tell them, ""It's a beautiful Band-Aid until you are in a more stable place where we can actually have your own hair open."" So I create the beautiful Band-Aid, put the beautiful Band-Aid on, and then they continue to work along with their therapist doing some form of behavioral therapy, or they'll do habit-reversal training or treatment. It depends on whatever regimen they have set up with their therapist, depending on what type of therapist they have. So that's usually ongoing. So they'll see me every four to six weeks so I can do tightening and treatment on their actual physical hairpiece. And that's a support to go along with their either weekly or bi-weekly meetings that they're having with their therapists, pretty much. So that's with them. So with the alopecia and people that are recovering from cancer, because I do have a small group of those kinds of clients, too, those clients are wearing pieces until their hair grows back in. And then when their hair grows back in-- and I do have some clients that come in four to six times a year or at least once a season. They come in to get full treatment trends just to see how their hair was growing and everything is nice and healthy. And sometimes, they just want to come back and visit anyway. So it's different depending on the hair condition that I'm actually treating."
920.0,946.0,Interviewer,"I see. And this may not be your specific area of expertise, but you certainly know more than I do. So I'm curious if, for people who have trichotillomania, kind of when you put a hairpiece on, is it different for them in terms of how much they might feel that compulsion to pull the hair out or is it the same type of battle as their own natural hair?"
946.0,1001.0,Subject,"Okay. So it is definitely a deterrent because of the base that the hair is actually put on. So that base, which I call hair jail, it is a netted base. It's a base made with like a fishnet or a netted grid. And then the hair strands are actually hand tied, one by one, on to that net. So once I have their hair either braided down or flattened down underneath, then I apply that to them, and their fingers can't get through that base material. So because their fingers can't get through, it is a deterrent, and it does frustrate them. For the first three to six months, I am definitely their enemy. [laughter] They're trying to get up in there. One loose spot, they're trying to get up in there. But it is definitely made to be a deterrent."
1001.0,1007.0,Interviewer,Interesting. So it's not that they have necessarily the urge to pull out the unique hair strands that are on top [crosstalk]?
1007.0,1053.0,Subject,"Yeah. No, they don't. No, because they wouldn't feel that. See, usually, with people that are pulling their hair, they pull from certain areas. It's usually the sensitive areas of your head. So it's the mole, the temples, or right behind the ear. And a lot of times, people are pulling right behind the ear because they can actually hear the hair come out of the pore and also feel it more because those are pressure points. So that's why I make sure that I stitch it all down, put them in the hair jail, and it just frustrates them for a month. And then they come back, and I re-secure it and put them back into the hair jail. Then we wait for them to have probation. [laughter]"
1053.0,1060.0,Interviewer,"Oh, cool. Wow. That's so interesting. And how is it that you got into this niche from maybe general?"
1060.0,1229.0,Subject,"So I was 19 years old in Hunter College but working in a hair salon. I went to college because I had strict [inaudible] parents, and I had to go to college. So I got my degree in accounting. Great. But I always wanted to do hair. And so I was working in a hair salon part time while I was going to college full time. And I always loved doing extensions and wigs. And I've always loved it because I love that you-- I mean, it's more of an artistry for me. So you can actually have a person come in one way, and they look completely different when you leave. I just always thought that was the coolest thing. So I had a client come in, and she came in wanting extensions. And so I was looking through her hair, and I was telling her-- because I knew nothing about trichotillomania, I was just telling her. I said, ""Listen, you have a lot of breakage. This could be alleviated with using extensions."" And we were just talking. And because we were just talking, she felt so comfortable to just tell me, ""Well, listen, it's actually not breakage. I have a condition called trichotillomania."" And she started telling me about it, and then I researched it. And then once I found TLC, which is the Trichotillomania Learning Center, the main organization that actually supports people that have trichotillomania and other obsessive-compulsive disorders associated with hair, because there's trichotillosis and trichobezoar - there's so many other different types of trichotillomania - I was able to reach out more to that particular clientele and advertise to them. And then just building my business. And I realized that I was no longer just doing hair extensions. I was a part of changing people's lives. And people became dependent on me, and I became dependent on them because they were paying for my livelihood in college. And I was making sure that they had beautiful hair, and they were able to feel comfortable to walk around. So it was just great that first time, and she's still my client to this day. And it's also great to have a client for that long because I've watched her graduate college, get married, have two kids. She moved from New York to Pennsylvania. You build your life with these people. I have people that remember that I was pregnant, and now my son is 12. He just turned 12. So it's amazing. [crosstalk]."
1229.0,1241.0,Interviewer,"Wow. Yeah. Yeah. [crosstalk] it's the same for them in your direction. I'm sure that you grow together in that way, as you said."
1241.0,1252.0,Subject,They watched me grow and my life change. And we have shared interactions. It's great. So yeah.
1252.0,1264.0,Interviewer,So you kind of talked briefly about how COVID impacted your business. How did you observe that COVID was impacting your client population?
1264.0,1327.0,Subject,"Okay. So after my business closed-- because we had to officially close. Excuse me. I'm just going to plug in. So after my business closed, I pretty much lost half of my clientele. I mean, I understood. A lot of my clients ended up getting laid off. I had a handful of clients that actually died during that period because they had other autoimmune diseases they were dealing with and then caught COVID. And depending on your job, if you were a teacher or any type of frontline worker like a police officer, working in a hospital-- I have a lot of clients that are actual nurses. They didn't make it."
1327.0,1330.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's so tough.
1330.0,1357.0,Subject,"Nurses are the last people that take care of themselves because they're always taking care of other people. So that was hard to deal with because you're paying your respects over Zoom. There was no in-person funerals, and so that was hard. That was hard. I had about eight clients die."
1357.0,1359.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk].
1359.0,1468.0,Subject,"And other clients got sick. Yeah. And other clients got sick and recovered but didn't-- I have a client right now. She still has a asthma problem. She's like, ""I got my EpiPen and my pump,"" because of, I guess, what they call long-term COVID long effects have really affected her lungs. So I'm happy she's still here. Knock on wood. I'm happy she's still here. She struggles in certain weather. Right now, we're in a heatwave. And she was like, ""Well, I can't come outside. I can't. I have to work from home. I'll figure out my appointment. I got to wait till the heatwave is gone because it's humid. It's hot. It's sticky. The air is tight."" She's like, ""I can't [crosstalk] just walking to my car."" Other than that, it was a financial hit to everybody. And also, the reopening - oh, my gosh - was such a joke to me because it's like, ""You can reopen with 50% capacity."" What does that mean? I can have two and a half clients in the salon [laughter] instead of five? [laughter] What do you want me to do? That was hard. And then also to bring them back into the salon. Forget just masks. We're doing masks. We're doing gloves. We're doing Plexiglas dividers. We're doing Lysol. Oh, my gosh. It's just like, ""Wear a hazmat. Just wear a hazmat suit."""
1468.0,1475.0,Interviewer,Which is all an investment in all those materials and all those right after coming off of kind of a really difficult financial period.
1475.0,1577.0,Subject,"[crosstalk] and earning nothing. Earning nothing. Being in a single-income household. Although my family is small, we live in New York, and it was tight. We're good with life. We can cut out luxuries. We don't have to stream this. Even though it was the best time to stream. We were all home. But it was just mostly thinking about making sure my son can actually do remote school, making sure my husband can work from home. So we have to have internet. We have to have food. We have to be able-- that was another thing. Food was scarce. The supply chain issues. We're still going through the supply chain issues trying to rebuild back inventory. Actually, to have inventory has been challenging. So when I came back, I came back, and I made sure I was doing COVID discounts and trying to at least be able to take some type of-- create a discount that could take some money off of the client's bill. So at least when they came in, they didn't feel like I was going to be overcharging them because there was so many people that was doing COVID pricing. And the COVID pricing was so ridiculous. I mean, even just going to the pharmacy, it was just like, ""What?"" Oh, my gosh. The prices for a can of Lysol was like $25. I was like, ""Why?"" [laughter] [inaudible]."
1577.0,1581.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk]. Tissues.
1581.0,1726.0,Subject,"Oh, my. Bleach. Alcohol. It was just so-- so that's why I'm like, ""Right. Currently, I'm feeling fantastic."" [laughter] But that time, it was rough on me. It was rough on clients. And even still now, I have certain clients that now, after those big vaccinations and boostings and stuff, they still just don't even feel comfortable just coming into the salon. I have provided a full-on ventilation system, which I mean, I had to borrow money from my husband to help me actually put this new high-tech ventilation system in. So I've done everything that I could do, but I cannot make a person feel confident about either coming back on site. That's a lot of-- it's between physically and emotionally being scared and then just the mental health part of it. There's a lot of people that have anxiety about going outside. It's not even just COVID. And now it's like COVID, guns, drugs. [laughter] You step out of your house, and it's just like, ""I want to make it there and then make it back home. I just want to make it to the grocery store and make it back home. And I don't want to get shot at the grocery store. I just want to be able to make it there and get back home."" So that was a tough time. I had my depressed moments because I wasn't able to do what I wanted to do. So now I lost a piece of my identity. [inaudible] because that's my identity. I have clients that call me the hair fairy. One client, she calls me supersaver weave. And I couldn't do that stuff. All I could do was just sit and wait for the people in charge to tell us when we can do the things that we want to do. And I respect everybody that had to make those hard decisions, but it was just like, ""Make a decision and stick to it. Don't tell us we can go out, then we got to go back in. Then take the mask off, then put the mask back on. And stay six feet away, no, three feet away, no, five feet away."" It was so much information."
1726.0,1730.0,Interviewer,"Right. 2 days after a negative COVID test, you can go back. No, 14 days. No, 5 days."
1730.0,1753.0,Subject,"[crosstalk]. Oh, my goodness. And that's why me and my family avoided traveling because even though I had friends, I was like, ""Oh, no. I'm getting on a plane. I'm [inaudible]."" I was like, ""There's too many rules to get on the plane and then get there, and then you have to COVID test at the hotel. And you got to COVID test three days before you leave."" I was like, ""I can't."" [laughter]"
1753.0,1759.0,Interviewer,"And then in this direction, COVID tests are free. In the other direction, COVID tests are charged, so."
1759.0,1804.0,Subject,"There you go. We're going to drive. We're going to do lots of road tripping. So we did long weekends. We just road trip, road trip to Boston, road trip to Jersey Shore, road trip to Baltimore just so we can get a change of scenery a little bit. But we're not really even staying in a hotel. This is the first that we're going to be in a hotel resort. We've been doing Airbnbs, which were great. They were great. But it's different when you're in a hotel resort with the pool and the energy and people and [crosstalk]."
1804.0,1808.0,Interviewer,And they make your bed for you.
1808.0,1828.0,Subject,"Yeah. Oh, it's so nice. You don't have to-- they come in, they clean your room. Ah. You're not wiping your own things down, and like, ""This is not really a vacation. We just moved our situation from home to another state."" [laughter] So I'm really excited for that."
1828.0,1836.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so exciting. That is so exciting. Well, we're right about at 30 minutes. So if there's nothing else, I'll stop the recording."
