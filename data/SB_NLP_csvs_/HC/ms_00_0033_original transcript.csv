2.0,5.0,Interviewer,So how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,22.0,Subject,"Everything has been pretty okay. I've been working multiple jobs, so trying to find that balance but also take care of myself at the same time."
22.0,36.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what is that balance that you're trying to strike right now between taking care of yourself and working these jobs and paying the bills and everything else?
36.0,105.0,Subject,"[Our greatly adulting?] lives, yes. But I'm a personal assistant for one of my jobs, so the duties include certain housekeeping things like personal shopping. It's mainly things along that line. And then I also am a cosmetologist, so I travel back and forth between the city doing hair. And I try not to work more than four days out of the week for both jobs only because it can get very stressful, and I need time to decompress myself. Honestly, this is the first time that I'm making breakfast in a while, so. The balance just is literally finding time to separate work from myself and make sure that I'm good enough to be able to do each job to the fullest potential that I know I can. Yeah, literally just taking time for me."
105.0,114.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's so good. So what do you like about being a personal assistant or what do you not like? How has that been going?"
114.0,168.0,Subject,"I mean, what I don't like is the fact that I have to work for someone else, but there are benefits to it. It's like I'm growing as a person but also in a community [inaudible]. I don't know the proper word, but. And then the person, they have knowledge that I don't have, so it's just like, okay. I'm learning new things every day, different ways to organize certain things or incorporate a different strategy on how to-- I'm trying to find the proper phrase that I'm looking for. I don't know. It has its good days and its bad days."
168.0,180.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what are some of those kind of growth moments that you feel like you may have had over the course of this position?
180.0,226.0,Subject,"When I first started, I was a little more closed off as a person. Now, I have found ways to establish certain boundaries so that I can still be authentic, but at the same time, still be professional, and certain ways to, I would say, prioritize tasks. I'm very detail-oriented, so sometimes, I'll focus on the little things for a long time, but then I have this big project that I have to do. So it's like, all right. I got to step away from here, focus on the big thing, and then when I have time later on, I can go back and focus in on the little detail."
226.0,229.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, [inaudible]."
229.0,257.0,Subject,"Also communication-wise, I end up having to do certain phone calls to customer service reps or whatever the case may be, so there's a whole lot of jargon involved, and it's like just a step up from, I guess you can say, secondary-- not. Is it secondary school? What do they call college? Post something?"
257.0,260.0,Interviewer,Yeah.
260.0,285.0,Subject,"So yeah, it's just different communication skills, learning to organize better. Basically coming into myself while still [hanging?] these certain skills in whatever-- what'd you call it? Job set, job [frame?], something."
285.0,307.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense. So do you have any kind of examples or could you maybe say a little bit more about the process that you went through in terms of kind of being able to set those boundaries and still be authentic and yourself?"
307.0,400.0,Subject,"So it's like I started this job, I want to say, 2019-ish. And then when I first started, I would do it five days a week, maybe six. And yeah, it just wasn't working out for me because I sort of like a good maybe two weeks off where I had to be like, no, I need me time, da, da, da. But throughout the course of the past, I would say-- where are we, at 2022? [inaudible]. Throughout the past year, I would say, that I've gotten better with it because being able to just do that for two days a week as opposed to more gives me time to do other things, but at the same time, process what I have been doing and clear my head for other things or even myself. I think I said something about coming into myself more as a person. When I first started, it would just be like, ""Okay, do it. They've instructed me to do how they've instructed me to do it."" But I've learned certain ways to do what I'm told but in a way that works better for me whilst still ensuring that the process is what we're both looking for. Do I need to give more examples?"
400.0,418.0,Interviewer,"[inaudible] that's so important, I think. It does really facilitate maybe a feeling of ownership. I don't know if you felt that, but yeah, kind of that you're in control even though you're kind of not always necessarily in control."
418.0,422.0,Subject,"[inaudible]. Very much, yes."
422.0,423.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's--"
423.0,425.0,Subject,I'm trying.
425.0,442.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that's huge. And so now, you also are still working at this other job. How has that situation [inaudible]-- yeah, what is that other job like?"
442.0,511.0,Subject,"Well, I work for myself with this, so I set my own schedules. I set my own hours. The only thing is that different clients would want different things, so I have to ensure that if I don't have the skills that they're looking for that I can refer them to someone else, or if it is something that I don't have as much experience in, I can communicate that. And if I need-- well, I always need to. I brush up on whatever skills I need and I'm able to do the job, not just to my liking but to theirs as well. That also includes budgeting, purchasing, making sure that I have things stocked supplies-wise, time management, with traveling and also-- sorry, I'm going back and forth now."
511.0,513.0,Interviewer,"No, it's okay."
513.0,530.0,Subject,Traveling but also ensuring that I'm doing the required work in a set amount of time so that we don't feel like we waste a day or anything.
530.0,540.0,Interviewer,So what does your day-to-day look like on the days that you're mainly focusing on that job?
540.0,631.0,Subject,"So I would wake up-- it's a little blurry, sorry. I wake up, I get ready. I like to pack my bags from at least the night before so that I'm not rushing in the morning because honestly, it takes me like a hour and a half to take a shower, to do my whole routine and everything. So that is very time-consuming. And I like to sleep in late, so that just saves me a little bit of time. And then you never know what's going to happen with the trains and all of that. So I wake up, get ready. It depends if I have to take the MTA or the Metro-North. And then once I get to the client, usually they're ready for me. If they're not, then it'd be like maybe it's 15 minute delay-ish, but we have conversations about having when to start. If the consultation before, it wasn't as precise as I wanted to be, when we meet up, we still talk through any questions, comments, or concerns that either of us have. And then I just get started with the process until we're done. They pay and I go home or wherever I have to go next."
631.0,639.0,Interviewer,So sorry. Could you just give me a little bit about the process itself just because I don't have any expertise on it?
639.0,769.0,Subject,"Okay. So the process would depend on what kind of style they're looking for. So let's say they wanted to do box braids, right, with extensions. So if they don't already have the hair, I would've gotten the hair beforehand. And if they needed their hair washed, when I get there, we do the whole shampoo, condition process. And then I would blow it out-- well, detangle it then blow it out, section it into whatever parts I need. So this is pre-parting. I would section it into the appropriate size parts for the style that they're looking for. So if they wanted jumbo braids, I would make bigger parts. If they wanted small, I would make them smaller. And I try to keep it an average of four hours. But sometimes, when they wanted smaller, I end up being there for like six hours. So with the parting, I would go in with whatever products I need, which would most likely be jam. And then with each section, I would braid in their hair with the extension hair. And then once all the braids are finished, I would trim anything that's unnecessary. I would mousse it down after I oiled their scalp. If they need to set it in hot water, I'll dip the braids in hot water, the ends of the braids in hot water. They always have a cape on. They always have protection. What am I missing? That's box braids. If they wanted to do locs or something, it would also depend on how they wanted to start. So if they wanted to start it as two-strand twist or if they want to start it as individual braids or if they wanted to just the comb coils-- I'm not sure if you know what those are. So I would just take a section, use the small-tooth side of the comb and just twist the hair with the comb. Twisting."
769.0,773.0,Interviewer,"Oh, cool."
773.0,821.0,Subject,"So it's a lot of hand work. It's also a lot of head work, focus. You have to remain focused on the task, and I like to be a perfectionist, so that's just me. I felt like if it's not looking right, then I don't want to send you outside or wherever you got to go. And people would be like, ""Oh, da, da, da, da."" Or you would be like, ""Oh, this is not what I want,"" such and such and such. If I'm done a service and it doesn't look as great as I think it should, I'm like, ""Hold on a second,"" and we just fix this or let's fix that. I send them to the mirror. ""How does this look to you?"" And then we go from there."
821.0,839.0,Interviewer,"There are so many hair stylists who just send you on your merry way even if they know that that doesn't look the way that it should, and so nice take the time to hear what they think about it and to make sure that you're happy with it as well. That's just so nice."
839.0,890.0,Subject,"And I think that's one of the reasons I actually started doing hair. I mean, it was something that I already knew how to do from when I was younger because a lot of the women in my family, they were just doing hair. So I graduated high school, and then I needed money. I wasn't trying to go straight to college because I didn't really know where I wanted to go or I didn't have a immediate focus. So it's like, I like to work with my hands, let me just do that. But I realized that a lot of hair stylists or at least people that-- a lot of hair stylists, they don't care about the person that the hair is on. So I'm like, I care. I know what I'm doing. I have the skills, so let me put it all together and try to make the world a better place one person at a time."
890.0,916.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, and a better looking place. Well, I'm just so [inaudible]. So kind of how did your process go after that point? So you were kind of debating whether or not to go to college, and in the meantime, you started doing hair. And then what transpired from there for you?"
916.0,987.0,Subject,"I believe I was working doing hair for maybe six to nine months, give or take. And then I enrolled in a college for massage therapy right in Chelsea. So I was there for a little while, but I didn't get to graduate because of medical papers, so that was put on hold. And then I just went back to doing hair for, I guess you could say forever. But I was also during the summertimes, I would either do-- I was still young enough for Summer U, so I would do Summer U jobs. And then if it wasn't Summer U, I would be working at either Arthur Ashe, the tennis stadium, or City Field or [anything?]. Apparently just always service-oriented with me, so I was just in those type of jobs."
987.0,1005.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How did it feel to be in that situation where you had put in all that work for the massage therapy school and then it kind of didn't go all the way through right at the last second? That must have been so tough.
1005.0,1062.0,Subject,"I was very disappointed because I actually liked the school. I liked the professors. I liked the curriculum, so it was like, dang. I haven't even got into the clinical, clinical side yet, so it's like and I had to put this on the back burner. I thought about going to a different school and transferring the credits, but I never went and said, ""All right, yeah, sure."" To me, I didn't think there were any other schools that offered the same - what would you call it? - degree. Because they were actually offering, I believe, an associates in occupational sciences. And everywhere else, they either just did certificates or something that wasn't as in-depth. So I just chalk it up as a lesson. I don't want to say [L?] is a lesson."
1062.0,1086.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, totally. So it's a lesson [inaudible]. Anyway, okay. So then you went into doing, yeah, the service industry. So what is it about kind of working with people or in services that has appealed to you over time?"
1086.0,1132.0,Subject,"I just feel like if you can be kind to someone or you have the skills necessary to help out people that truly desire a certain-- okay. If I was a gardener, right, and I knew all the types of nutrients and necessary situations for plants to thrive, and there were people who were trying to grow a garden or bring their plants back to life, I'm like, ""Hey, let me help you out because it just makes me feel good."" And I know that at the end of the day, I can make you feel just as good if not close. Yeah."
1132.0,1139.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, it's amazing. People need a skill that you absolutely have, and it's just kind of a good match in that way for you."
1139.0,1154.0,Subject,"Yes, and apparently, the beauty industry, customer service, and it's a few other industries, but those are a few that people are always going to need. They always [had been?]."
1154.0,1172.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And how did COVID impact that need for your jobs? Did you feel that there was a big reduction in need or in desire for those types of jobs, or was it still the same?"
1172.0,1253.0,Subject,"I feel like when COVID first started, I thought maybe things would dwindle down, but people were actually needing it more because people couldn't go outside to do what they wanted to do. And since I always traveled to people's homes, it was like, ""Hey, here I am."" And then a lot of my clients, they come through referrals, so that was just a blessing for me. But during the two years, I feel like at the beginning, it was great. And then what [year am I?] 2022 now, so the beginning of this year, it was not the greatest. And it was just like, ah, but I've learned that there's always going to be ups and downs when it comes to not just this service but finances in particular, especially with the way the economy is going. So it's like, yeah, we're going to have great moments. We're going to have great ones. But then there's also going to be a few weeks where it's going to be like, okay, we're not bringing in as much, so we're either going to have to find something to supplement that income or just be with what you have. So I've learned to be."
1253.0,1255.0,Interviewer,And [inaudible]--
1255.0,1266.0,Subject,"For me, sometimes people give out gifts, and it's just like, yeah, it's a beautiful blessing. I appreciate all the tips. I appreciate just people being generous, so I like to give back also."
1266.0,1294.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So did COVID impact your personal assistant job at all? So I feel like what I'm understanding is the hair styling work that you were doing, because it's in people's home, were still booming during the COVID. But yeah, how did that impact the personal assistant side of things?"
1294.0,1352.0,Subject,"I don't feel like it impacted it very much because it's just one woman that I work for. But she actually ended up referring me to one of her friends, and I would just do her personal shopping for a little while, so that was just another added bonus. But I mostly would work in-- when I did the personal assistant, I would mostly work in her home. Sometimes, she needed things virtual, so if I would be home, I'm on my computer helping her out. If I needed to go to the grocery stores and shop, either we would have it as a purchase-it-and-pick-it-up, or I would go in with a quick short list, hop in a cab, and go to her home. I feel like it was easy as opposed to how other people had it."
1352.0,1361.0,Interviewer,"I see. Yeah, so your jobs were maybe more tailored to seamlessly integrate into more a COVID environment."
1361.0,1362.0,Subject,Correct.
1362.0,1377.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Are there any parts of the personal assistant job or tasks that you do as a part of it that you really enjoy and wouldn't want to give up at all?"
1377.0,1410.0,Subject,"The organizing, I would say, because that's really what gets me. I don't want to say I'm a neat freak, but I prefer order over disorder. And if I can look at something and see, okay, yeah, we can maneuver this, da, da, da, da, then that's perfect. I feel like I slipped and missed the question, but I was halfway answering it."
1410.0,1420.0,Interviewer,"[inaudible] are there any specific aspects of the personal assistant job that you would never want to give up, that you love doing, or just fun for you to do?"
1420.0,1519.0,Subject,"Oh, okay. So yeah, I mean, organizing, but also, she's a great chef, so I'd be having some dinners and some lunches. I be like, yeah. [laughter] I'm a big foodie, so it's a plus for me. But there's also, I have freedom to do things that I need to do on my time while I'm also working. So it's beneficial for both sides, I would say. So the food, the organizing, the freedom. I mean, the pay is great, so I can't really complain on that sense. It's a clean neighborhood. The house, for the most part, it's clean. I do what I can, and when I can't, she does, so. It's a safe environment. Yeah. I feel like my only downsides would be how much work is needed at a certain time. So some weeks, I need to do more cleaning than others because it's just crazy. Some things just happen. And other times, it's like, okay, we got to do more laundry this week, or I got to do more shopping this week. It gets a little tedious, but with the labor involved. But yeah."
1519.0,1530.0,Interviewer,And how did you even find the kind of that partnership with the woman that you work with? Was it again a referral or did you-- yeah. I guess just how did you find it?
1530.0,1590.0,Subject,"So initially, she found me because I had a hair ad out. This was when I first graduated high school. I was doing ads for the hair, and she hit me up. I did her hair in the same home that she's in now. And then she ended up going over to Jersey, and then I ended up going over to her in Jersey. And then throughout the course of the years, it was just doing her hair. And then after, I want to say in maybe 2018-ish, maybe that's when she transitioned from her workspace to her home. So instead of going out to office, she's at home, so she needed help in her home. So I'm like, all right. She trusts me, I trust her. We have a mutually beneficial relationship, so why not take it up another level? And here we are."
1590.0,1604.0,Interviewer,So cool. So it was super organic in that way then. And so it's also so cool how your jobs can kind of help each other out in that way that's also so unique.
1604.0,1653.0,Subject,"It is very much. I mean, it's not where I thought I would be when I graduated, but I'm-- how would you say? I mean, I'm not disappointed. I don't know. There's a phrase I'm looking for, I just don't know what it is. I want to say I'm better off for it, but I don't know because my life could've taken so many different turns, so I don't know. I'm just grateful for where I am now and what I have experienced and been able to pass on."
1653.0,1673.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And hopefully, you feel that it's never too late to re-pick up any old path that you feel like you want to pursue in the future, and you want to incorporate into all the really nice stuff that you've been learning and growing through all this entire time."
1673.0,1700.0,Subject,"I mean, psychology and teaching have always been something when I was in school that I said I wanted to do. And I pick up bits and pieces wherever I go, so I've had opportunities to teach certain skills. And I've had opportunities to learn certain psychological terms or go through certain assessments, so I'm like, yeah, you're exactly correct. It's never too late. Never."
1700.0,1747.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, and so much of teaching and-- especially I guess my experience is more in psychology, so I can speak more to that. But a lot of people just would love a helping hand and that's again, this mutually beneficial situation where you are helping people out, but you're also learning so much. And then they can refer you, so I think so many of the skills and even the frame work that you've created with your business and just how you've been able to grow that and continue that for so long and build these phenomenal relationships, I think all those skills are directly applicable to any other field that you may also want to expand into, so I think that's just very exciting."
1747.0,1759.0,Subject,"Thank you. It is. I don't realize it in the moment, but afterwards, I'd sit back and I'm like, oh, yeah. I got this."
1759.0,1760.0,Interviewer,"[Absolutely?]. I mean, even being--"
1760.0,1762.0,Subject,"Even I don't got it, I help."
1762.0,1787.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Even being a volunteer in a research lab, it's somewhat similar to being a personal assistant. I mean, maybe you're doing tasks that you wouldn't otherwise be doing, but you're learning a lot and you're building these relationships. I think there's a lot of kind of parallels that you could draw between many different jobs in different fields, so it's kind of a matter of how you market that, maybe."
1787.0,1794.0,Subject,"That's the part, marketing. It's not my strong field, but."
1794.0,1798.0,Interviewer,I'm sold. So it's only been 30 minutes and I'm sold.
1798.0,1807.0,Subject,"Thank you, I appreciate it. Be genuine because it takes a lot of work to not be."
