3.0,6.0,Interviewer,Okay. So how have things been going for you lately?
6.0,8.0,Subject,Fine.
8.0,12.0,Interviewer,What does fine look like these days?
12.0,35.0,Subject,"I mean, there's always kind of a lot going on. Busy and tired, but [inaudible] it could be worse. I don't know. I don't get a lot-- sometimes I don't get a lot of sleep, but I usually will catch up on a certain day. So I'm towards the end of one of those cycles where I haven't gotten a lot of sleep for a few days. So I'm fighting to get a good night's sleep, and then start again."
35.0,41.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Totally. What are some of the things that you have kind of in the works right now?
41.0,59.0,Subject,"Well, I just got back from traveling, and it always takes a little bit for me to adjust. And then just regular work stuff. I had some issues with my apartment yesterday that were a little bit stressful, but everything's fine today, so."
59.0,70.0,Interviewer,That's good to hear. Sorry to hear that that was stressful though. What was going on if you don't mind me asking that was kind of adding stress?
70.0,102.0,Subject,"Oh, I woke up yesterday. I had no electricity, and I didn't know why. So I mean, I was hoping that when I got back from work in the evening that it would just be back on, and it still wasn't. And then I was up late, mostly because I was a little bit worried about it, but I was sort of like just cleaning and I was talking on the phone, and then my phone was going to die in the morning. I was just trying to figure out what to do. And then the electrician came, and it's okay."
102.0,107.0,Interviewer,Got it sorted. Okay. So what was the issue? What was going on?
107.0,124.0,Subject,"They actually had my - what do you call it? - unit wired incorrectly. And so it turns out I've been paying for someone else's electric this whole time. So that person shut theirs off, but it wasn't shutting theirs off. It was shutting mine off because it wasn't wired right."
124.0,129.0,Interviewer,Oh my God. That's so crazy.
129.0,131.0,Subject,It was crazy.
131.0,134.0,Interviewer,"So had they been getting it for free, or what's the deal?"
134.0,148.0,Subject,"I have no idea. I don't know. I don't know. I think they must have been either paying for some else's or possibly mine, but it's not clear. It's not for certain."
148.0,164.0,Interviewer,"It's like some major AC Ponzi scheme going on there. Oh, wow. That's crazy. Well, maybe you were their secret AC guardian angel, providing them with AC this entire time."
164.0,177.0,Subject,"Don't know, but I mean, I've been out of town. So I was kind of looking forward to that break on my bill. Went out of town for a couple weeks. So I'm like, ""Oh, I've been using no electric for a couple weeks."" So I have to see what the bill looks like when they send it."
177.0,186.0,Interviewer,"I think they have a lot of rectifying to do, probably, on that front in terms of the bill being correct."
186.0,196.0,Subject,"Yeah. I mean, it wasn't that bad. I just felt bad. I have a small dog, and I just couldn't tell how hot he was. I was okay, but I was worried about-- I was more worried about him than anything else."
196.0,200.0,Interviewer,"Oh, and is he doing okay now?"
200.0,214.75,Subject,"Yeah. He's fine. I actually think he was getting a little bit of a heat rash. We came from somewhere very hot and we got back here, and he had a little baby rash on his hind legs. And this morning, it already looks better than it did yesterday. So I know that's what it was."
214.75,215.0,Interviewer,[crosstalk].
215.0,222.0,Subject,"[inaudible] take him to the vet too, which is another thing, of another vet. I just went to the vet. I was like, ""Want to go to the vet?"""
222.0,231.0,Interviewer,Yeah. How did you identify the heat rash? I didn't know that dogs could even get heat rash.
231.0,248.0,Subject,"It's just something I looked up before, because when I first got him, he had a lot of skin issues, and I had to narrow down whether it was allergies or what it was. And so just from looking at different things, in my head I was like, ""I think it's probably just a heat rash,"" but I was about to take him to the vet just to make sure. But when it looked so much better already, I was like, ""Okay. So it was a heat rash."""
248.0,254.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That makes sense. And how was your trip?
254.0,273.0,Subject,"It was really nice. Again, a lot of running around. I have this bad habit of whenever I'm away-- I don't know. Because I'm trying to do as much as I can. So I always stay up really late. So I'm always just perpetually tired until I get back."
273.0,283.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That can be tough. What are some things that you needed to get done on the trip that you wanted to prioritize over sleep?
283.0,298.0,Subject,"Well, I wasn't on a total vacation. I was still working remotely. And so it was about managing my time after work, and then spending time with people after I finish working or before work or whatever. So that's why it was a little bit harder."
298.0,303.0,Interviewer,And have you always been remote?
303.0,322.0,Subject,"No. I mean, well, since COVID I was remote initially right away. And then now I have a hybrid schedule, but I just got permission to work remotely because I don't want to take all my vacation days for just this vacation. So I took a couple of vacation days, and then worked remotely for the majority of it."
322.0,327.0,Interviewer,"Oh, nice. Well, that's at least good that you have that flexibility then."
327.0,329.0,Subject,Yes. It's really nice that they're flexible like that.
329.0,333.0,Interviewer,So what is it that you're doing right now for work?
333.0,351.0,Subject,"I work at a literary agency, and I work in the contracts department. And so it's very detail oriented. Semantics are very important. Just about making sure the terms are correct, and then working on the best terms possible for the clients that we represent. [crosstalk]."
351.0,357.0,Interviewer,So-- yeah. Sorry. Who are the types of clients that you guys would be representing?
357.0,435.0,Subject,"Oh, authors and illustrators mainly, but in addition to their projects, their books that they're working on, often, they may or may not receive deals for film or TV, or also, merchandise. So we have their merchandise contracts, which is usually something like a T-shirt or stuffed animal or something that's book related, like all the little knick-knacks you see at Barnes & Noble and things like that. And then the film or TV is an option in case their work gets turned into that. But then we have some people that are just working-- they're getting commissions to do work for a project. So for example, one of my favorite things is we have this client who creates fictional languages. So when you watch a show, and it's dwarves or something and they're talking to each other with the subtitle, he made it up. They really make it up, and they really write the script for them, and they really have to talk in it. So I think that's so fun. So we do a lot of-- he gets a lot of those contracts because it'll be per season. So sometimes it's a renewal for a show that's already on. He's just like, ""For the next season, they're commissioning to do a certain amount of work."" Or for a future project too."
435.0,442.0,Interviewer,Oh my gosh. That's so cool. So the minions or some--
442.0,466.0,Subject,"Yeah. Or the dwarves in Christmas Chronicles. I don't know if you saw that Christmas movie. What else? I don't know. It's a bunch of Netflix things. Shadow and Bone, that series. Anything where there's another set of people, and they're speaking some language. Something gets made up for it. Cartoon or real life."
466.0,484.0,Interviewer,"That's so cool to think about. You always just think it's gibberish that no one really thought through, but it always sounds like it has a pattern or some rhyme or [crosstalk] they're doing. So it's cool to know that there's that behind it."
484.0,504.0,Subject,"Well, I also didn't necessarily realize that they were really fake. I thought maybe they were using something that-- you know what I mean? Using some bits of some language that just wasn't a well-known language. I don't know. I didn't know they really took the time to make up this language and write it down."
504.0,513.0,Interviewer,"And write it down. That's so funny. What if people discover it a millennia down the road, and they decide that that's going to be our new language?"
513.0,516.0,Subject,That's going to be our language. Yeah. I guess they could.
516.0,521.0,Interviewer,"Or that's the only remaining document, and they're like, ""This is what they used to speak."""
521.0,525.0,Subject,"Yeah. Oh, that would be funny."
525.0,532.0,Interviewer,"Oh, that's so interesting. So how have you been enjoying this role that you're in?"
532.0,646.0,Subject,"I've been enjoying it because prior to this, I also worked in publishing, but at a publisher. So being at an agency, it's another side of things. And then being in contracts, we are covering all the bases. And so I think when it comes to publishing, people usually only think of writing and editing, but since there's several other departments, the contract will kind of touch on all of those departments and details about it. So it's interesting to get to look at it that way, but on the agent's side, I think the way it makes most sense to explain it to people is kind of like when, okay, athletes are going to maybe switch a team or something and they have-- a agent represents them, and they're trying to get them the best deal for their contract, but the contract expires. So then they're like, ""Okay. We're going to renew this contract,"" but they rework the terms. They're playing really well. They're going to get paid better. Or if they win a championship, they get this bonus or whatever. So in the contract there's bonuses like that. Like if there's a certain amount of sales, or if it earns a certain amount of-- well, there's earn out and sales perform, which is two different things. It's selling a certain number of units versus making a certain amount of money on the sales. And then there's also selling the rights to translate it into a different language. And then there's the marketing and what they're going to do for the marketing campaign. And then there's promotion and whether they have any say in what the cover's going to look like, or if it's exclusively to that. Or when they go on tour, do we pay for their hotel and stuff? There's just a lot of other details that you don't really think about. So it's a nice way to get an overview of everything else that has to be-- everything else that goes into it. So I like that aspect of it."
646.0,659.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And do you work directly with the client in that way, or are you kind of involved in one aspect more specifically? I don't know. How does your role fit in with the client?"
659.0,721.0,Subject,"Well, we work more directly with-- so the agent will work directly with the client, and we are speaking with the agent. So I guess the agent kind of liaisons between our department and the client in terms of what they want, and we liaison between our agent and the publisher in terms of negotiating the terms. So they come to an agreement before they decide they're going to have this contract. This is what we're going to do. They come to that agreement. They may have that discussion and based off what they agreed on is how we start working on the contract, but in the meantime, it's never just like, ""Oh, okay. Here it is. Let's sign it."" It's like we look at it, and we're like, ""But wait. We want this too,"" or, ""Last time it was like this,"" or, ""This time we can't have that."" And so it's a bit of a discussion that has to happen. So it's very rarely that we're talking directly with the client because the agent does that most. My department, the agent does that most."
721.0,743.0,Interviewer,"Got it. Yeah. And so what are some of the factors that might go into whether they would write into the contract like, ""Oh, this person is going to get ability to make a movie,"" or, ""Oh, this person will have a free hotel""? How do they make those decisions in advance of the book actually selling?"
743.0,812.0,Subject,"Well, one thing I guess with a lot of other things. It's the reputation. So if it's a author that is already a selling author, has already had a big hit, or the last book got turned into a film or movie, I mean, you can always put it into the contract as a-- I guess you call it a what if or cautionary thing. Not necessarily knowing that it's going to happen, but in case it does, this is how we know everyone's going to get paid. But then for people that it has happened already in the past, it's easier to get certain terms or better terms. And the same thing with the royalties of the different sub rights, including merchandise and things like that. Certain merchandising rights we always retain, and some will be like, ""Let the publisher keep most of them."" And so if we didn't negotiate to make sure that they got any merchandise rights, the publisher could take the book and make a bunch of stickers, and then the author wouldn't get anything from those sales because we didn't negotiate them to keep those rights. And it's like who knows if that's ever going to happen. So it's something you have to kind of like think about in advance."
812.0,837.0,Interviewer,"Right. Wow. That's so interesting. And also, yeah, what if this publisher is kind of taking a chance maybe on a new author? And so then the author doesn't want to be too pushy. Do you ever have any of those types of negotiations where it's kind of unclear how far you're able to push the boundary with the publisher in that way?"
837.0,881.0,Subject,"Well, that's where the expertise of the agent really comes in because we'll just encourage the author as to what they know that they-- what their potential is or they deserve. There are some things that-- sometimes we'll have an opinion on something where we're getting pushback, and the client kind of is like, ""Oh, we're fine with letting that go,"" and we'll do whatever they direct us to do, but we just kind of advise them. The agent and the client usually will have their conversation, and we will advise the agent. And then the agent might go back and have another conversation and say, ""This is our advice."" But then ultimately, whatever they come back and tell us the client wants to do is what we're going to do [crosstalk]."
881.0,902.0,Interviewer,"Right. And so based on all that, would you say that it kind of is more important for an author's first book to make sure that they have a really good contract negotiated because these future books can potentially be based off of the terms in the initial contract?"
902.0,967.0,Subject,"I mean, it doesn't hurt, but you have to bear in mind that if their first book does really well, then the sales and the popularity of the book is what's going to push-- is going to be a big push in the next negotiation. So even if they had certain terms in the last one-- we call it precedent, but the precedent isn't necessarily going to be deemed automatically in the next book. Sometimes we do have to go back and point out, like, ""Okay. This is what we got last time. Can we get it this time?"" And sometimes you can use it as leverage. So sometimes we'll let something go to get something else we want more. So everything is not necessarily set, but certain people when they're at a certain level-- like the author of that Divergent series, for example. There's certain things where you're not going to let go or that they're going to get-- they're going to get every time when it comes to their subsidiary rights. But yeah, when it's a newer author, obviously, we're trying to do the best thing possible, but there's going to be room for improvement if their book does well next time."
967.0,983.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. So how has the fact that books are going digital and there are audio versions and Kindle versions-- how has that I guess transition in technology impacted your work?
983.0,1044.0,Subject,"I mean, my work specifically, not-- I mean, it's actually part of the same contract. There's audio clause and digital, and those are also subsidiary rights. So when a book gets turned into an audio book, one thing is depending who it is-- so if it's a celebrity author, usually it's going to be in there that the author is going to narrate, but sometimes it's like the author won't narrate, but they get approval over who is going to, or they'll get consulted over who is going to. So that's the audio piece of it. And then eBook, it just turns into another right to give to make sure that the client's getting a percentage of, and how much percent the client's getting versus the publisher's getting. But yeah, I mean, publishers usually have an entire audio department. So it's kind of just another branch. It doesn't necessarily negatively impact the standard physical format."
1044.0,1056.0,Interviewer,"So when-- and this is just curiosity, but is it typically the publisher's preference that the author narrate, or no?"
1056.0,1103.0,Subject,"It definitely depends because it's just not as easy as it seems like it would be. It seems like it would be okay. Sometimes you actually would prefer they didn't, but sometimes certain memoires, it's going to be preferable, but it also just depends on how much they're going to-- sometimes the amount it's going to cost to get them to narrate is too high. So then that's why they're not the narrator. Yeah. It's just kind of depends because usually-- it also depends what kind of book it is because if [inaudible] have a certain tone or say it in a certain way, and if a person isn't able to do that, it's preferable to get someone else to do it."
1103.0,1111.0,Interviewer,"Okay. So it's not awkward, like, ""Your voice is nasally, and we don't want you."" Or is it?"
1111.0,1140.0,Subject,"No. I think it really has to do with the subject or content of the book. It has to do-- if they wrote a kids' book and it just wouldn't sound right for them to be doing it and they can't do the voices and stuff, or even if they wrote a literary fiction book, but because of the type of banter that the characters were having, it didn't sound right for them to do it. Then it's more based on that."
1140.0,1151.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. And have you found that authors are generally indifferent, or do they usually have a preference, and if so, which way? To be involved in the audio book I mean."
1151.0,1168.0,Subject,"I haven't really seen a pattern. The only pattern I would say I see is when it's, as I had mentioned, a celebrity memoire. And they usually end up narrating it. But other than that, it's not 100% that anybody would do it or not do it."
1168.0,1196.0,Interviewer,"Yeah, no. I just was curious. There's so many audiobooks now, and I, as a consumer, can't necessarily determine - besides, I guess, as you're saying, the memoire and maybe even self-help spiritually type books - who would be narrating and who wouldn't. Sometimes the narrators are better than the author might be, and I don't know, sometimes I miss the author's voice."
1196.0,1252.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's kind of funny though because I think outside of those celebrity books, it's like you don't necessarily know the author's voice anyway. So if you're reading a book, you kind of create this-- not sound, but you create what you're feeling like it's going to sound-- or what the person who's speaking sounds like, or the tone of the conversation in your mind. So it's always interesting to listen to an audio book and hear how it's spoken. I generally prefer reading a physical book, unless it's a memoire or self-help book, but then sometimes I think it's helpful to actually try the audio because I found once that I preferred listening to it then reading it just because the person was doing such a good job in the way that they read it. They were capturing the spirit of the book. And so I really enjoyed listening to it, and it surprised me because I just generally prefer reading it."
1252.0,1262.0,Interviewer,And how was it that you even got into this whole publishing space and book space?
1262.0,1338.0,Subject,"Well, I was just trying to figure out what to do in college, and towards it in high school I was working in restaurants because I thought I wanted to do something with food because I really enjoy cooking. And so I would just work in restaurants because I just like learning all of these menus and learning about ingredients and preparing drinks and stuff. But then when I was thinking about something I would want to do and think I could keep doing for years and maybe not get burned out, I got the idea of publishing just because I had always [inaudible] being a really avid reader, and because there are so many departments, I felt like I could possibly just switch into something else if I got tired of doing one thing, but still be in the publishing space. And so that's what appealed to me because there were so many options in it. But being in contracts was-- I'm not going to call it an accident, but kind of because it wasn't in my-- in my mind, it wasn't what I thought I would be. It was in contracts, but I did think it was a good way to get a kind of bird's eye view in a lot of different departments at once, and how they work and affect the process, so."
1338.0,1343.0,Interviewer,"Which it sounds like you have been finding, right, in your experience."
1343.0,1344.0,Subject,Yeah.
1344.0,1351.0,Interviewer,That's awesome. And are there any opportunities to merge the two interests and do cookbook publishing or?
1351.0,1406.0,Subject,"Oh, I would love to. Yeah. There are definitely agents that will be-- because agents usually have lists of what they're looking for when it comes to their submissions. So it's not that every agency just publishes everything. Sometimes you get to an agency and their list isn't actually mainly just kids' books or mainly just political or mainly just science fiction. Well, in a publisher, they're usually doing everything in all their different imprints. And so I've found that there are agents that are looking for cookbooks in their submissions. And then I've also noticed which imprints within the publisher publish a lot of cookbooks, and there's definitely ones I have my eye on that are more like lifestyle, pop culture focused and cookbooks, and I would like the experience to get to edit cookbooks. I think that would be so fun. Or doing production for cookbooks. I think that would be fun."
1406.0,1415.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. You could test the recipes as you go, just to make sure they're not lying to their consumers."
1415.0,1437.0,Subject,"Well, sometimes the way that a cook writes a cookbook isn't user friendly. So they'll write it all out because they're writing what to do, but then it's the work of a editor to kind of like write it into something that someone can read and use better."
1437.0,1449.0,Interviewer,"So you could be on both ends of having had the experience as a chef or in the kitchen and that side of it, while also being able to look at it and say, ""Okay. Does this make sense?"" Is that--?"
1449.0,1471.0,Subject,"Yeah. And then from my own perspective too. Even if it's something I probably would never make, I love just flipping through a cookbook anyway. So I don't even feel like I would feel like I was working at that point if it was my job to do the production of a cookbook, and I had to just look through it and say what I thought looked right or where to move things or what picture to use."
1471.0,1475.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. The whole picture aspect is so fun too, no?"
1475.0,1490.0,Subject,"And to keep in mind the different kind of like measurements. If it's something from overseas versus here, or the type of ingredients and everything like that."
1490.0,1499.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Definitely. Well, I want to be really mindful of your time, actually, because I'm looking at the clock and we're right at the 30-minute mark. So if it's okay with you I'll stop the recording."
