2.0,5.0,Interviewer,So how have things been going for you lately?
5.0,15.0,Subject,It's pretty good. Yeah. There are ups and downs but hoping for better.
15.0,20.0,Interviewer,Yeah. So what have been some of the ups and downs?
20.0,57.0,Subject,"Yeah. Ups. I guess I had a great summer. I did a lot of stuff in terms of just exploring New York City and doing things, which is fun. But then downs. I recently broke up with my boyfriend, which is kind of like sad because he was-- I don't know why I'm smiling saying this, but he was such a big part of my life before, and it just feels weird when he's not here. Yeah. So yeah. So I'm hanging there."
57.0,61.0,Interviewer,Yeah. That's tough. I'm sorry to hear that.
61.0,79.0,Subject,That's okay. Yeah. I'm trying to process it and go through the six stages of grief and all that stuff. Yeah. So it's getting better.
79.0,88.0,Interviewer,Okay. That's good. I'm glad to hear that. What have you been doing in the city that kind of made the summer exploratory and fun?
88.0,167.0,Subject,"Yeah. So I am a resident assistant. I don't know if you know what that position is, but basically, living in a dorm. I work with students. Put on events for them and building a community kind of. So over the summer, obviously, all the students are going home, and we have a summer program. That's all the high schoolers are here exploring the city and the school. I think I forgot to mention, but I go to NYU. I go to NYU. So basically, they're here for a summer program, and yeah. And then so what we did is, basically, building a community with the high schoolers to show them what it's like being first year at hall and being a college student. And in order to kind of-- attracting them coming back to this school, we put up a lot of events within the hall that are very big-ticket events. So for example, we go see Broadway shows. We go to Empire State Building. We go--"
167.0,168.0,Interviewer,Wow.
168.0,326.0,Subject,"--[crosstalk]. Yeah. All a bunch of-- a variety of events. So because they're all minors, right, we have to kind of chaperone the events, and I was able to-- I mean, I love Broadway shows. I don't know if you like it, but I love it. And COVID made the whole entire shows be on pause for a while. And then even afterward, people were just not feeling comfortable gathering in. The [inaudible] was like a million people. I mean, not a million people, but a bunch of people there. So I remember going to shows when I was a first-year student, but then haven't been for a while, like a year and a half when the COVID was-- the peak time of COVID. And this year, because the summer, what they did-- I don't have to pay for the shows. So I was able to see a lot of shows I really want to see, and I think I saw like 17 shows over the summer. Yeah. So it was really fun. I think it was my biggest issue over the summer. Yeah. But then when you see too many at once, you're like, ""Oh my gosh."" I'm struggling with my attention span because those shows are so long. Stuff like that. Yeah. Also this summer, I discovered that I really, really love to go to zoos. So we went to Bronx Zoo, and it was really fun. I know those zoos are not like wildlife conservation, all that stuff. It was still fun seeing them there. And then before this week, I went back to California where I went to high school. I went to visit San Diego, which I've never been because I was in LA. So I went to San Diego. I went to the San Diego Zoo and it was really fun too. So I think this summer, just a lot of stuff. Normally in the past summers I work on a internship or research or whatever, whatever, but this summer I was like, ""I'm going to take a break, and I'm going to do this stuff and events."" Yeah. So yeah, it was fun. Yeah. I'm very happy about this summer. It's very memorable."
326.0,338.0,Interviewer,"That's amazing. I can't believe how much you did. And so, of any of the 17 shows, were there 2 or 3 that were your absolute favorite, or that really stood out to you?"
338.0,378.0,Subject,"Yeah. Okay. I'm a huge musical person. I can't watch plays. They're just so boring to me. But musical, I love the music. I really love MJ, which I've never seen before. It was the first I've seen it, and it was after-- I mean, the cast won Tonys and all that stuff. So it was really cool. I love Michael Jackson-- his music. So it was really fun. I know that musical was very controversial, but then to me it was like I'm there for the music and stuff like that. So it was fun."
378.0,380.0,Interviewer,What was controversial about it?
380.0,459.0,Subject,"So people were saying how they design it, it shouldn't just kind of like-- promoting him and showing him. All this good side. Putting up a good story. Because the show is about he putting on the Dangerous tour, right? And it's like all variety of aspects of why he's getting paler and paler. Why is he kind of like this and that. So the play's demonstrating it through a very positive lens. They're explaining, like, ""Oh, this is a variety of reasons why he's like this, why he's turning into this."" But then some other people were like, ""Well, that's just not true and just not how the reality is, and you guys are just promoting Michael Jackson."" Blah, blah, blah. So I don't really know the details, but that's what I heard. One of my other friends, she really hates that play-- I mean, that show. She was like, ""Oh, I cannot bear it."" I'm like, ""It's so good."" Yeah."
459.0,461.0,Interviewer,"[Hates?] the play. Okay. Well, good to know."
461.0,478.0,Subject,Yeah. And then another play-- or another musical I really like-- I really like SIX. I don't know if you've heard of SIX. So SIX is about-- oh my gosh. I don't know why I started giving this speech. I hope it's okay for the--
478.0,486.0,Interviewer,"[crosstalk] this, and I really [inaudible] suggestions because I've never seen 17 in a row. So I feel like you're an expert."
486.0,607.0,Subject,"Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I love talking about it. It is so fun. So SIX is about Henry the VIII and the history. How he had six wives, and they all end up being killed or beheaded. Only one of them survived. So this play-- or this show is taking it through a modern context. So instead of talking about this historical plot, they made it very contemporary. So what happened was-- how there were six wives. They are trying to compete for this lead singer spot as a girl band in New York City. So how they do so is by telling the audience their story, and whichever person had the most horrible experience with Henry the VIII as their husband wins the lead singer. And then so they're just like-- I also love it the most because it's the shortest. It's only an hour and a half. It's really engaging. It's songs by songs by songs by songs. So you never have a spot where you're like, ""Oh, this is boring."" So each wife kind of like-- each queen talk about what they had through Henry the VIII. And then the end. They are like, ""Well, why are we putting such a heavy emphasis on him? We should be our own queen. We should be living our own lives."" So they start changing their mindset. They're like, ""We're all lead singers because we all have our own unique life,"" and stuff like that. So I thought it was really fun and really cool. Yeah."
607.0,614.0,Interviewer,That sounds good. Interesting how they took such a not modern concept and made it so modern.
614.0,638.0,Subject,"I know. Yeah. Sometimes I think about that. I'm just like, ""That's just kind of insane how those playwriters are so smart. How they have this much imagination and coming up with this play."" I was like, ""Oh, that's insane. I can never."" So I admire them."
638.0,645.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Same. Yeah. So those two. Was there any other one that stuck out in your mind or were those kind of the two?
645.0,651.0,Subject,Yeah. I have so many. I have two more. I'll tell you two more.
651.0,652.0,Interviewer,Okay. Perfect.
652.0,659.0,Subject,"So I also really love Tina. Tina Turner, the musical. I don't know if you have heard or seen it."
659.0,664.0,Interviewer,"I've heard about that one, but I don't know really what it's about. I just know that it's Tina Turner's music."
664.0,765.0,Subject,"Yeah. It is. I think they're closed now. It's not the first time I saw it this summer. I saw it also in the spring. So I saw it again. And it's so crazy because I'm not from US. I was born in China. So I came to the US without knowing that she is such a huge star at one point of the pop culture, right? So I heard some of her songs, but I don't even know who she is. So the first time I saw it I was like, ""Oh."" I read the synopsis. I was like, ""Oh, this is about Tina Turner and her life and how she became amazing singer and how she was able to dodge this--"" not dodge, but, ""How she put up with this horrible ex. And then how she was able to find her true love with this producer and stuff like that."" So it was really fun, and her music are just so engaging, and I never felt like there was a gap between my age and the age group that listened to her songs when she was most popular. So I thought it was really cool. And yeah, absolutely loved the music. And there's another one I really like. Okay. Two. I have two that's heart to heart. I really love Hadestown. I don't know if you've heard of Hadestown or--"
765.0,766.0,Interviewer,[inaudible].
766.0,965.0,Subject,"Yeah. So Hadestown is actually [inaudible] through this Greek myth. How Eurydice and Orpheus-- and then Eurydice is this girl, and she's married to Orpheus, and I think-- whatever. Stuff happened in that time period where she died. And so she goes down to Hadestown where all the people who are-- after they are dead are in Hadestown. And so she went there. Her husband, Orpheus, was like, ""I need to bring her back."" So he went down to Hadestown, and then he finds Hades, the god who's in charge of the death. And he was like, ""Well, I want my wife back. I'm going to bring her to life."" And so Hades was like, ""Well, what the fuck? She's here. I can't just let you go. That's so rude on my image,"" and blah, blah, blah. So he made a pact with Orpheus. So Orpheus sings him a song, and Orpheus was like, ""Well, if this song truly makes you feel touched, then you should let my wife go,"" right? So after he heard the song, Hades was like, ""Well, it's a good song. I'm going to make a pact with you. You can bring your wife to life, but you have to go through this tunnel where you have to go in the front, and she stay in the back. At whatever time point, you can't turn your-- you can't turn around your head. If you do, then she's going to forever stay in Hadestown."" So he was like, ""Oh, let's get."" So they were going through the tunnel. And then, obviously, it's very dark. He doesn't know if she's actually following him. He doesn't know if this is just a trick of Hades. And he had all this wild imagination, like, ""This is just a game plot all along."" It wasn't real. And obviously, there are other spirits near him and her in the tunnel. It was like, ""She's not here. Turn back your head and turn around."" Blah, blah, blah. So when he's almost reaching the exit, he turned around his head, and then he saw her, but she slowly descended into Hadestown. So it was a really sad story. Yeah. But the music was great. The actress and actor was really cool. I love Greek mythology. So it was really fun. Yeah. So yeah. And then another one I like. It's Kinky Boots, but maybe you've heard of it or maybe you haven't, but those are all great show recommendations that I love."
965.0,971.0,Interviewer,Oh gosh. That was such an enthralling story. I was just like on the edge of my seat. [laughter]
971.0,984.0,Subject,"Yeah. Yeah. I know. It was so good. I love how the plots are-- when they're engaging, then you're like, ""Oh, I know what's--"" I wanted to know what's happening next. Stuff like that. Yeah."
984.0,987.0,Interviewer,So why did he turn around?
987.0,995.0,Subject,"I know. I was so mad too. I was like, ""Bro, don't do that."""
995.0,1002.0,Interviewer,"Darn it. Okay. Well, that was so interesting. Thank you so much for all those recommendations."
1002.0,1004.0,Subject,Of course. Of course. [crosstalk].
1004.0,1019.0,Interviewer,"And you mentioned that you're an RA as well, and that you've been kind of doing all these things to make people feel like they're in college and to see what it would be like. What has your experience been with the real college students when you have them [inaudible]?"
1019.0,1161.0,Subject,"Yeah. So in the academic year I work with first year students. So basically, they're like high schoolers. They've just come out of high school. And then they're very interested and curious. So it's fun. They're definitely very different than high schoolers in terms of the mindset and everything. They're like, ""We're so cool now. I don't care about what programs [inaudible] you're putting on."" The high schoolers are-- even though they're kind of obnoxious sometimes, they're just so loud and they're like, ""God. Nobody cares about--"" Nobody really cares about you when you're actually in college. Don't put huge emphasis on yourself because sometimes they're kind of rude and they think because we're helping to build a community and that we're in the hall working as the staff, it means that we're their servant. High schoolers would think like that. So it's kind of like-- oh my gosh. No. That's not true. Show some respect, honestly. But yeah. But then the first-year students, they're interesting. There are two groups. There's one that's like, ""Oh, I'm interested in everything. I want to explore. I want to learn."" And there's a group like, ""Oh, I only want to do whatever I can in school. I don't want to engage with any other people inside my community because I know it's useless,"" and stuff like that. So they're not interested in the programs. So there are two types, and I always love the type where they interact with you. And then you're able to make a connection with them. Otherwise it's just like, ""Well, I know you, and then I never see you again. I only know you at the beginning of the semester."" So it's kind of like sad and you don't get to see them. Yeah. So it's been a mixture of experience when I'm interacting with first year students. Yeah. Because I'm the type where I really love interacting with someone and talking to them. So when they're not showing engagement and you try really hard to push the connection, and it's not happening, you're just like, ""Oh man. That sucks."" Yeah."
1161.0,1172.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Definitely. Definitely. Do you feel like you can tell who is going to be in which group right off the bat, or does it take a while to get to know them?"
1172.0,1336.0,Subject,"So it does take a while to get to know them. You can tell who's-- you can kind of tell by second week who is the type where they are interested in exploring. So normally the first six weeks we have to put up one event on our floor kind of to-- just like hall snacks. That's what we call it. To make sure we're engaging with them. To kind of like help them start in this community and stuff like that. So the people who actually really love exploring and coming and just engaging with the community are the ones come to the hall snacks. And then they're also going to be the ones-- kind of like make sure that they're on top of what they need to do because when you first got there, there was a whole bunch of stuff that you need to do, like you need to sign up to meet with me one-on-one, to write out this contract how you wanted to live with your roommates and suitemates. So the one we're engaging are the ones-- knows when the deadlines are. Knows, ""I signed up for this meeting. I'm going to show up on time instead of just ditching her."" Stuff like that. So those people will be the ones you're like-- oh, those are the ones that will show more initiative engaging with you. There are ones where you'll have to-- really pushing them to submit their living agreement. Sign up for the base meeting. That's what we call to meet one on one. So yeah, you have to send them 10 reminders before the meeting, and just like, ""Oh my gosh. It's coming up."" Which is kind of like-- you're in college student-- you're a college student now. You should be on top of-- yes. You are here for a class, but you're also living here where there is other stuff that's required for you to pay attention to. So it's annoying when you have to hunt them down to just meet with you for five minutes, and then don't even want to do that. They ignore your emails. I'm like, ""God. What a waste of time of me and you. If we [inaudible] this out early, then it's over. You don't want to see me? That's fine. You don't have to, but when I really have to see you, make sure that you're paying attention too or [inaudible] respect other people's time."" Yeah. So sometimes that's a struggle. Yeah."
1336.0,1349.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. Definitely. Oh, it's so important to corral these people who are not interested in seeing you as a valuable resource and even friend and mentor."
1349.0,1355.0,Subject,Yeah. I know. Literally. Yeah. It's hard.
1355.0,1372.0,Interviewer,"I guess I had the impression that if you were coming to NYU, it was partially because you were interested in being involved in the community of New York City, but do you feel like that's not a big deciding factor in people's decision to come?"
1372.0,1482.0,Subject,"Yeah. I guess, honestly, I'm the type you just mentioned. You want to engage in the community. At least just like explore, or if you don't like the events, show up and check it out for five minutes and leave or whatever. Well, I think recently, more-- because of COVID, I think they're lacking this period of time in high school where they actually build this deeper community with their high school classmates because everyone's virtual. So you can't really build that engagement. I think maybe now, for the students who are coming in first year at the college, kind of like even though we're still having COVID around, but post-COVID time, they're lacking this social skill kind of like to know what to expect and to know how to engage with people. Sort of like, ""Oh, I'm only living here because I'm going to classes. So other than classes, I don't care about any of the other stuff."" Which is not true because college is a experience where there are multiple aspects, right? So class is just one of them and living with someone and building a community within the hall, that you see this person every single day is another one. So I guess they just kind of like don't know. And then they probably just like, ""Oh, this is how it's like. In COVID this is probably what I know the best, and this is what I'm going to do."" Yeah. I think that's probably why they're not engaging as much."
1482.0,1504.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. That's so interesting. I hadn't thought about the way in which COVID had impacted their community building perspective, but that makes a lot of sense. Did COVID impact the experience that you had while you-- in COVID. Not only post-COVID, but also during COVID, what was the experience like?"
1504.0,1617.0,Subject,"Yeah. So we had one year. It was my junior year. So right now I'm a second-year grad student. So my program, it's five years, where four years are college and one year of master programs. It's actually really weird every time I tell everyone. They're asking what year are you? I'm like, ""I am--"" I don't know. How do you say it? I'm a first-year master's student, but that's not true because I'm finishing it next spring. So my junior year, which was kind of two years, year and a half ago, we had the dorm set up in New York City, but every class was remote. All the programs were online. So even the activities we do were all online, and inside the hall you can't visit each other's room. You can only stay in your own room. And there was a quarantine period for two weeks and stuff like that. So it was very, very different, and I think it definitely impacted how we engage with the community, yeah, through that time because you only see people online. And when you see people online you can't gauge how tall they are. So when you bump into them in the elevator, you're like, ""Oh my gosh. I thought you were going to be taller, but then you're actually the same height as me,"" or you're like, ""Oh my gosh. I thought you were not that tall. You are just a bit taller than me. But you're actually huge."" Stuff like that. So it's fun. It was a fun time. Definitely don't want to go through it again. Yeah."
1617.0,1622.0,Interviewer,"This is just a funny thought, but how tall do you think I am, just from the Zoom?"
1622.0,1626.0,Subject,"Oh, okay. Do you use inches and feet?"
1626.0,1628.0,Interviewer,Yeah. Or centimeters. Whatever you prefer.
1628.0,1637.0,Subject,"Okay. I think 5'7"", 5'8""."
1637.0,1645.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. So it's funny. I mean, I am tall, but it's so funny because when I met people in person, they were like, ""Oh my gosh. You're huge."" I'm 6' tall."
1645.0,1649.0,Subject,Oh my gosh. What? I can never tell through the camera. Holy.
1649.0,1651.0,Interviewer,It is so funny. [crosstalk].
1651.0,1652.0,Subject,That's crazy.
1652.0,1660.75,Interviewer,"I remember that one time I had my first in [inaudible] like, ""Whoa."" [laughter]"
1660.75,1661.0,Subject,Wow.
1661.0,1665.0,Interviewer,I had to be with them the whole semester. It was funny. Anyway. So I totally agree with you.
1665.0,1674.0,Subject,"Wow. I would think you were tall, but I wouldn't think you're-- wow. That's really tall."
1674.0,1681.0,Interviewer,"Yeah. It's funny. Okay. Well, I want to be mindful of your time because we're right about at 10 o'clock. So if it's okay with you, I'll stop the recording."
